Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Richard Vaccari : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we\u2019ll be discussing Sempra Energy\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Financial Results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I\u2019d also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 2, 2014, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 3 and I let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra Reed : Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before I get started off I\u2019d like to thank those of you who attended our March Analyst Conference in San Diego and those of you who also participated in the webcast. It was a great opportunity for us to discuss our strategy for achieving a 9% to 11% growth rate and the numerous additional projects in development that could provide upside to our plan. On today\u2019s call we will discuss our first quarter financial results and provide you with several operational and regulatory updates. Earlier this morning we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $256 million, or $1.03 per share. Our first quarter earnings were in line with our growth expectations and consistent with our full year of 2014 guidance. On our Cameron liquefaction project we are happy to announce that FERC completed its environmental review process and published the final environmental impact statement on April 30th. We are now awaiting the final FERC permit which we should receive this summer. This is an important milestone and we expect to be the second U.S. LNG Export Project to begin construction. Consistent with our 50-50 partnership model for renewables we successfully completed the sale of a 50% interest in our Copper Mountain Solar 3 facility during the quarter. Additionally on April 21st, we announced a partnership agreement for our ESJ wind-generation project in Mexico. On the California regulatory front SDG&E and Southern California Edison reached an important settlement agreement with key parties that was approved by the CPUC to resolve all outstanding cost issues on the SONGS plant closure. We have also received the proposed decision on our pipeline safety enhancement program. We will provide further details on all of these developments later in the call. Now let me hand things to Joe to discuss the first quarter results in more detail starting with slide four. Joe? Joseph Householder : Thank you Debbie. As you mentioned the first quarter financial performance was strong and in line with our growth expectations. We reported first quarter consolidated earnings of $247 million or $0.99 per share. Excluding a $9 million revision to the loss on the SONGS plant closure we reported adjusted earnings of $256 million or $1.03 per share. This compares to earnings of $178 million or $0.72 per share in the same quarter last year. In comparing first quarter performance year-over-year remember that first quarter earnings in 2013 did not include $29 million of earnings from our California utilities as a result of the general rate case delay. In Feb these earnings were recorded in the second quarter of 2013 after SDG&E and SoCalGas received their rates case decisions. 2013 first quarter earnings were also impacted by several other items including a $44 million gain on the sale of a portion of the Mesquite Power plant. In addition we recorded a $63 million deferred tax expense in the first quarter last year related to the IEnova IPO restructuring. In the first quarter of 2014 we recorded $12 million of estimated deferred tax expense to reflect only a portion of the planned repatriation for the year. However our estimated annual tax rate includes an expectation that we will record additional deferred tax throughout the year to reflect our plant repatriation for 2014. Now let me turn to our earnings guidance. First I would note that the impact of the SONGS settlement was not in our original guidance. Still we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance per share at $4.25 to $4.55 including the $9 million or $0.04 per share of SONGS impact. Also last month the President of Chile presented a tax reform proposal to the Congress that would increase the corporate tax rate from 20% to 25% and apply a 10% additional shareholder tax when profits are earned rather than distributed. The higher proposed taxes are likely to be enacted this year although the final rules have not yet been determined. We expect the proposal would phase in the higher corporate tax rate over a four year period beginning in 2014 and change the shareholder level tax starting in 2017. In the quarter the [innate] tax changes enacted we will record changes to deferred tax liabilities impacted by the change. None of these potential impacts to the proposed Chilean tax reform is in our guidance, as additional details were pending and the timing of enactment is uncertain. Now please turn to slide five for details on SDG&E. First quarter adjusted earnings for SDG&E were equal to $108 million and excludes a $9 million revision to the loss on the SONGS plant closure that resulted from the settlement agreement. In a year-over-year comparison first quarter 2013 earnings were $17 million lower due to the general rate case delay. In the first quarter of 2014 $4 million in higher CPUC based margin and improved operational performance largely offset $6 million of lower earnings from both the reduced FERC authorized return on equity and the loss to SONGS rate base earnings. Now please move to SoCalGas on slide six. The SoCalGas first quarter earnings were equal to $78 million. As with SDG&E first quarter 2013 earnings for SoCalGas were $12 million lower due to the rate case delay. First quarter earnings last year were also reduced by $3 million of gas pipeline integrity expenses that were not recovered in rates in the first quarter. Instead those expenses were recovered in the second quarter of 2013 under the rate case decision and all ongoing costs are now fully balanced. In the first quarter of 2014 SoCalGas had $11 million in higher CPUC base margin and improved operational results. Now let\u2019s move to Sempra International on slide seven. At our South American utilities first quarter earnings were $35 million. In 2013 first quarter earnings were $37 million and included a $7 million impairment charge on our Argentine investments. South America\u2019s first quarter earnings are lower this year primarily due to $5 million of foreign exchange impacts resulting from the movement of currencies quarter-over-quarter. In addition Chile incurred $2 million of higher interest expense this quarter due to an inflationary impact on the local bond interest rate. As we discussed at our analyst conference, tariffs for South American utilities do adjust for foreign currency and inflation effects overtime. However there is some lag effect. Moving to Sempra Mexico, first quarter earnings were $42 million versus $31 million in the first quarter of last year. Sempra Mexico\u2019s first quarter earnings increased by $11 million due to a $10 million reduction in income tax expense including effects from foreign currency in 2013. First quarter earnings this year also include $9 million of AFUDC equity earnings from construction of the Sonora gas pipeline offset by $9 million of higher dilution resulting from the reduced ownership following the IEnova IPO that occurred in late March of last year. Looking forward to the second half of 2014 Sempra International expects to have several large projects coming online that will bolster earnings. These projects include the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines in Mexico and the Santa Teresa Hydro project in Peru. Now please turn to slide eight. Moving onto Sempra U.S. gas and power the natural gas segment earned $9 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $53 million in the same period last year. The difference in earnings is primarily due to $44 million gain after tax on the sale of a portion of our Mesquite Power Plant in the first quarter of 2013. First quarter earnings for the renewable segment were $28 million and included $16 million gain associated with the sale of 50% of our Copper Mountain Solar 3 facility to our joint venture partner ConEd. First quarter earnings also include higher deferred income tax benefits primarily due to a $5 million reduction in tax grant benefits in the same period last year as a result of the federal budget sequestration. With that, let me hand the call back to Debbie to discuss slide nine. Debra Reed : Thanks Joe. Now we will provide you with an update on some of our major projects. As I mentioned at the outset of this call on April 30th of this year we received the final FERC environmental impact statement on our Cameron LNG project. This is an important milestone and the FERC final order is expected this summer. In March of this year we also signed a lump-sum turnkey construction contract. Along with the progress we are making on financing we are on track to begin construction later this year. Turning to Sempra Mexico, this week the Mexican Government released its five years national infrastructure plan. The plan calls for investments totaling an estimated $13 billion in natural gas pipeline, $7 billion in power transmission projects and $14 billion in power generation projects including renewable. In the near term PEMEX plans to develop three pipelines to transfer liquids from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. PEMEX estimates that the total for these pipelines and needed storage and port infrastructure at over $2 billion. They deem guidelines to be published in the second quarter of this year. At a recent analyst conference we also discussed a number of natural gas pipelines to be awarded in the near term by Mexico\u2019s Electricity Commission. On April 21st the Commission announced five pipelines for which bid offers will be reviewed this summer. The total estimated investment is over $2 billion and three of these pipelines are in or have segments within U.S. territory. Each of the pipelines is expected to be contracted by the Mexican Government under a take-or-pay long term structure. We will watch for further details on the bid process but the segments in Mexico will likely be attractive opportunities for IEnova. We also view the US segments to be attractive opportunities for our U.S. gas and power business, particularly as they will be long term contracted assets that could blend well with Cameron in an MLP. IEnova also announced on April 21 an agreement to InerGen 50% of our 155 megawatt ESJ wind generation project. InerGen is a global power generation firm with 11 power plants in operation in Europe, Mexico and Australia. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is consistent with our renewable strategy to deconsolidate and reinvest proceeds in near term growth opportunities. For U.S. gas and power we recently completed the sale of 50% of our Copper Mountain Solar 3 facility to ConEd recording a $16 million after tax gain. The 250 megawatts facility is currently under construction and half of the facility expected to be completed by the end of this year and the remainder expected to be completed by 2015. Additionally U.S. Gas & Power agreed to invest in a 50% ownership of ConEd\u2019s California solar portfolio. This 110 megawatt portfolio is comprised of four operating projects that provide power our under long term contracts. Finally we have some really good news with regards to our REX pipeline. This week REX launched a binding open season for 1.2 BCS per day of East to West capacity. REX has already secured binding financial commitments for this capacity at rates of $0.50 per dekatherm for 20 years. If REX receives higher bids in the open season the shippers who have already provided commitments will have the opportunity to match the higher bid. Also during the first quarter REX concluded a successful binding open season on its Seneca lateral and we have filed with FERC to expand the associated capacity from 200,000 dekatherms per day to 600,000 dekatherms per day. The first portion of this capacity is expected to be in service in the second quarter of this year. Let\u2019s now turn to the slide 10 for an update on the regulatory proceeding at our California utilities. On the regulatory front our California utilities have seen important progress on two major issues. First, we announced at our analyst conference in March that SDG&E and Southern California Edison had reached a settlement agreement with key parties on the SONGS plant closure. The settlement agreement is subject to CPSC approval and was filed with the commission on April 3rd. If approved the agreement resolves all outstanding cost issues on the plant closure and allows for recovery of replacement power cost, operating and maintenance expenses and our non-steam generator investments among other things. The resulting financial impact for SDG&E is not materially different from the impairment we recorded in 2013, and we recorded an incremental $9 million after tax loss in the first quarter of this year. Additionally the agreement outlines a sharing mechanism between rate payers and shareholders for any third party recovery. On April 15th we also received a proposed decision for our natural gas pipeline safety enhancement program or PSEP. The proposed decision finds that SoCalGas and SDG&E presented a reasonable conceptual plan to enhance safety and adopt the basic structure of the plan. In its current form the proposed decision approved a process for cost recovery and balancing account treatment subject to a reasonableness review. The proposed decision also includes criteria for determining recovery of costs associated with records review and testing of pipeline installed after 1955. Our California utilities are seeking additional clarification on a number of key areas within the proposed decision and plan to file comment to the CPC by the deadline of May 5th. Now let\u2019s finish by turning to slide 11. In summary I am very pleased with our first quarter results. We are on pace to meet our 2014 earnings guidance and we have several large projects in Mexico and Peru coming online in the second half of the year, in addition to the numerous growth opportunities. At our California utilities we are making headway on significant regulatory matters like farms and PSEP, our Cameron liquefaction project remains on track to begin construction this year and our U.S. Gas & Power business has made important progress on both the REX pipeline and renewable project. So with that let me stop and take any questions you may have. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And at this time our first question will come from Matt Tucker from KeyBanc Capital Market. Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hi good morning and congrats on a nice quarter. Debra Reed : Thanks Matt. Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : First question on Cameron and now you\u2019ve got the FERC final EIS out there? Any sense as to whether they will take on the full, I think it\u2019s a 90 day window to issue decision? Or are you thinking that it could come sooner than that and I guess is there any role for you all to play at this point in the FERC process or is it just in their hands now? Debra Reed : Well I\u2019ll give you kind of a high level view but then I\u2019m going to have Mark kind of walk you through the schedule as we see it. The next step as you mentioned is not a precise period of time and generally to get to the next step where FERC issues the order is a 30 to 90 day period. Obviously with all of the issues with the Ukraine and all of the attention on that we would it certainly hope that FERC would look at keeping that period as short as possible and we thought it was a really good sign that there were no delays whatsoever in their issuing the final environmental impact statement. And so that was a positive sign. I would also say that Secretary Moniz have commented that once FERC acts on it than DOE intends to act very quickly and giving their final approval for the export as well. So I think with all the attention on this we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll be starting to see but there is not a required standard that will see some shorter time period. I\u2019ll have Mark kind of walk you through what we see is the way that it would unfold? Mark Snell : Yeah I think Debbie pretty much highlight exactly how it\u2019s going to work but we do, as we\u2019ve said we have the final EIS and they could take up to 90 days usually a little shorter than that but it could be that long. We\u2019ll get a FERC and then that has the mandatory 30 day comment period before it really becomes final. But during that period they could issue our initial authorization to construct which would allow us to do some work and get moving on the project. But I think as it stands right now and as we\u2019ve looked at the other projects, the other project that have received the FERC [inaudible] project. We still expect that we begin construction sort of later this year and that will time well with our financing and also meet the expectations that we laid out to you at the analyst conference. Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thanks a lot that\u2019s helpful. And then on the PSEP program you mentioned that the commission kind of endorsed your, I guess your model or structure for the program. Has your estimate for kind of the amounts of spending changed at all or was that part of the commission\u2019s proposed decision? Debra Reed : That\u2019s not really part of the commission\u2019s proposed decision. We are going through it and we are looking now what happened in their proposed decision is that they actually laid out the approval for all phases of PSEP, not just the first phase of PSEP. And so what that means in terms of how we do the work and how much work occurs over the 5, 10, 15 year period time we are going through and assessing that right now. What I would say as we look at the plan that we showed you in March for SoCalGas. We feel that we can certainly be consistent with the plan that we showed you in March of this year. Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great and then just one last one for Joe. I am sorry I missed when you were discussing what had \u2013 was in the original versus what\u2019s in guidance now if you could just go back over those items that you called out please? Joseph Householder : Sure. What I said was that the SONGS settlement there revision of $9 million, because of the SONGS settlement that was not in our original guidance. We are reaffirming guidance as the numbers we have that now includes that, so that\u2019s the difference. And then we also said that in guidance was nothing for the Chilean tax reform which has been recently proposed. Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thanks a lot. Joseph Householder : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : Yeah, hi. Debra Reed : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : Good morning, morning Debbie. So just to first on the REX news, could you maybe I think if I recall this project was not in your plan. Could you give us some sense on maybe how meaningful that would be to plan even if we stayed at the $0.50 and but also did the Seneca expansion as well? Debra Reed : Yeah, let me just clarify what is in the plan and what would be upside potentially to the plan. So there is really three pieces of REX that we are talking about. We are talking about the first phase of the Seneca lateral which is about 200 a day and then we are talking about the second phase of the Seneca lateral which is an additional 400 a day and they were talking about the east to west flows. And those east-to-west flows have been contracted at 1.2 Bcf a day at a $0.50 per dekatherm rate for 20 days. And that part of the open season, the binding open season if other parties wanted to pay more than that or look at different volumes and that\u2019s the purpose of the open season. But we really have firm contracts for the 1.2 Bcf a day at the $0.50 a dekatherm. We can\u2019t go through kind of what the investment levels are in each of these phases but I would say that they are not substantial. And so, what I would \u2013 you could and we cannot disclose what the rates are on the Seneca lateral pieces of that. The first phase of the Seneca lateral was in our plan of 200 a day. The second incremented for an additional 400 was not in our plan, nor was the REX east to west flow. So you can kind of do your best to calculate the numbers with what I have given you there and assume not huge levels of capital. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : And when would you think you will get a rough timeline for an answer on the binding open season? Debra Reed : I think it\u2019s May, that we are supposed to get that completed. Initial day was May 7th, I think and then they said something about if they may have to make some extension but sometime in May we would expect. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay, great. And then on the Chilean tax impact issue Joe could you just explain kind of what the process is and whether this is actually going to happen and is it more even would it be meaningful more from impacting your deferred tax balance or more from kind of an ongoing tax or I guess both? Joseph Householder : Yeah, Steve. That will be helpful. I can elaborate on that. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the President presented the tax reform proposal to Congress. She mentioned that she would be looking at doing something like this when she was running and so we expect that probably this or some form of this will get enacted but she wants to raise the current rate from 20% to 25% and we believe that will occur over a four year period. So 1% or 2% a year for a few years. This would increase our tax in Chile a few million a year in the early years, not so much because it\u2019s not a big change. But the other change that she wants to make has to do with the way that taxes under current law would be paid in addition so that they distribution tax, or withholding tax if you will, a second level tax that brings the rate up to 35% under current law. She wants to maintain the 35% rate but she wants those taxes paid currently even though the funds aren\u2019t distributed out of the country and she wants back beginning around 2017. We haven\u2019t tried to estimate what the impact on the deferred taxes are yet because it\u2019s a little bit unclear on the second part exactly it\u2019s going to work and when it be enacted but we will tell you on our future call when we know more information about that. But just to be clear she keeping the total rate of 35%, she is changing the structure so it will have some impact on current taxes in the next couple of years and then it could have a little higher impact if this 10% of additional tax gets imposed currently. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay, get it. And then last question is just on the Mexico bids when are those expected to be I guess decided? Debra Reed : Sure, I am glad you asked that because there is a lot really exciting things happening at Mexico and the Mexican government actually put out their five year plan that outlines the hundreds of billions of dollars of projects that they plan on several hundreds of billions of dollar just in the energy sector alone. And this year they have identified a number of projects, I think there is about ten or so pipelines that would be bid out this year. What we seen already the announcement from CFP of the five projects that I mentioned. And we expect those to be, the bid packages to be out within the next couple of months on those. Three of these projects are in U.S., two them are in Mexico and then we have also seen an announcement of bid packages coming out for our three projects from PEMEX over the rest few next couple of months. And one of those projects is a gas pipeline one is a naphtha pipeline and one is a liquids pipeline or propane pipeline. And so we are seeing a lot of momentum right now in terms of the bids coming out and they have identified more bids, another five or so projects later this year that\u2019s on their schedule that they have identified as being bid out this year. So we think it\u2019s a great opportunities, we are analyzing those right down looking at what is available on the project. So they said they don\u2019t have the bid packages out, so it\u2019s very difficult for us to assess which ones we would bid on. We are certainly into both of those in Mexico and the U.S. project. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : Great, thank you very much. Debra Reed : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Hi, good morning. Debra Reed : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: So first kind of the big picture strategic question as you think about the various monetizations that you have talked in the past, can you talk about where you are in the gas side of the world. You have obviously had a couple of [emerging] plans out there. And then also on the renewable side how do you think about the future of that business kind of given the [yield co] phenomenon out there et cetera and how that\u2019s procured? Debra Reed : Yeah, in terms of the power business I think your real \u2013 your question seems to be about the power part of our business which has the renewable and the generation. And on the generation side, in the U.S. we don\u2019t see that as a business that we want to be in and that we are exiting business. We have Mesquite held for sale, we have already sold our other power plants in the U.S. and that\u2019s largely because that doesn\u2019t fit our business model because that business when it was long-term contracted as it was when we had DWR contract then that made a lot of sense but for those assets today you are not get 10-20 year contracts on them. And that we \u2013 although we do have on a block at Mesquite a long-term contract but it\u2019s very, very competitive. It\u2019s not a focus area for us. So you are going to see us trying to exit that business this year in the U.S. I would say in Mexico we still own the TDM plant and as I mentioned is billions of dollars that are planned in Mexico for electric generation. So, we see an opportunity for that plant to meet some of those needs in Mexico and we\u2019ll hold that plant to enable that either at a long-term contracted arrangement or selling the plant down the line. In terms of the renewable business that we think it\u2019s a great business. The issue that we certainly always look at is the deferral of our ability to use the tax benefits from that business and it may be a great business. Our question is, is it a great business for us to continue to deploy capital in. We certainly are very focused on building out our solar facilities and if we see good projects on the wind side we are doing those but we are really focused largely on continuing to develop our solar side of the business until the issue on the taxes and what\u2019s going to happen with tax incentive gets a little firmer. I don\u2019t know Mark you want to...? Mark Snell : The only thing I would add to that is that again those renewable projects do fit our contraction, our contracting mode though which is the long term 20 years contract. They are all contracted for a long period of time. On the wind side, we are kind of, I guess the whole industry is a little bit up in the air. We don\u2019t know where we are going to be with CPUC extensions or not. I think from our perspective since we are not using all the tax credits some phase out of CPUCs or something would be probably be helpful for us. But I think what we will be doing is deploying capital primarily in our solar projects that are adjacent to some of our existing facilities. We have a fairly competitive pricing point there because we have a lot of infrastructure in place and I think we can win bids and be successful and get the kind of returns that we expect. So I think we are going to stay in that business but again it\u2019s going to be the long term contracted kind of profile that you come to expect from us. Debra Reed : I would just also add the analyst meeting we talked about our capital allocation and the things that\u2019s been great for Sempra is we have a lot of growth areas. We have a lot of places we can deploy our capital. And so we always look at these businesses in terms of the risk adjusted returns and how it fits for us in comparison to other alternatives that we have and we will continue to do that. Mark Snell : I would also just add Debbie, we talked about on a few other calls but we\u2019re always interested in way to increase the value and we try to look at whether the stock\u2019s being priced fairly and one of the things we talked about is our contracted energy infrastructure business is effectively a yield co. I was talking to myself this morning and I was thinking maybe we should just change the name to simply yield growth, [inaudible]. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: That\u2019s true. Well perhaps just a second strategic question and maybe this is a change in tack for your prior statements. But how are you thinking about the complementary asset here to backup Cameron, you kind of alluded to it little bit earlier. What exactly could those include just guiding from your comments and the remarks earlier as well as how are you thinking about timeline to get something off on the ground today? Debra Reed : Well I mean there is a lot of assets that are adjacent to Cameron that we own, like the LA storage, it\u2019s \u2013 that is something that we are looking at now, the potential of development of that. We have the Cameron pipeline, we are going to be \u2013 we have our other storage facilities that we think with all of the change that we\u2019re starting to see and we are seeing now the picking up the pace, hold the gas conversions occurring and then we are starting to see the LNG facilities coming on line over the next coming years. So we think all of those assets integrate well, we think other pipeline assets integrate well and that we think other LNG facilities, we have the Port Arthur property that we think is a very viable facility to develop and then we have train four and five at Cameron that we think are also viable to develop. So our focus is kind of around that cluster of assets that really kind of support each other and support the change and what\u2019s happening in the gas market. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: So just to follow up to be specific is REX now eligible to be included now that you have some of the contract comfort and then secondarily if it is to be included, do you still think you need other assets to look outside the complement starting, or kick starting in? Debra Reed : Yeah, we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time on this question, so I will let Mark and Joe answer this and I might summarize at the end. Mark Snell : Yes. Well, let me \u2013 I\u2019ll just kick in. Clearly we are pleased with the upside potential at REX that we just six months to year ago we didn\u2019t know whether \u2013 where we were going to be with that asset. So obviously given the interest on the east to west shipping and some of the lateral opportunities there clearly is a strong asset there now, that looks like it\u2019s going to have good cash flows for a long time to come. I think and Joe can comment on this but unfortunately we only own 25% of it and therefore there is some regulatory reasons why it is a standalone asset, can\u2019t be an MLP, but it can be in MLP with other types of assets that we own and we certainly have plenty to do that. I do think we are continuing to look in our MLP-able assets that make sense. And one of the most exciting thing is this pipeline announcements that came out of Mexico, there is several of those pipelines, three of them that are going to be in the U.S. and they are sizeable investment and if we win one or two or so of those they would also be very good assets for the MLP. So we see some real opportunities where we actually have some I think advantages because of our history with the Mexican government and our ability and the fact that we\u2019ve been doing business in the Mexico for a long time. I think we would be looked at as somebody that would have not only the wherewithal to do that but also the experience and I think somebody that will be a trusted partner for PEMEX and for the PFE on those pipelines. Debra Reed : I would just add that, in terms of the timing of when the government is expecting in this case PFE expecting this pipeline to go into service, one of them is expected to go into service in 2016 the other is in 2017. So they have nice timing relative to our Cameron assets. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Excellent. Thank you for all the details. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question will come from Gabe Moreen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gabe Moreen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning everyone. Not to stick with everyone\u2019s favorite acronym but related to the answer around the IEnova projects in the U.S portion of those projects. I guess two fold one is it possible to [recap] how much of that $2 billion is actually piped within the U.S. And then the second part of that is in terms of structuring it is that something that CapEx will be undertaken at IEnova even for the U.S. portions and then MLP would acquire it later, or does U.S. Gas and Power just build that section and it eventually goes to an MLP? Debra Reed : Yeah. Let me tell you about the three U.S. pieces of the project and I\u2019ll have Mark or Joe talk about some of the options for structuring with IEnova. The three pieces the government has estimated as part of the $2 billion that those three pieces end up being, it looks like about $1.2 million of the total. So they are quite large. There is one that $250 million and then the largest of the three is $550 million in the government\u2019s estimate. Now the government\u2019s estimate kind of seemed low to us from what was published but those are the Mexican government\u2019s estimate for those pipelines, So you can see that there is sizable pipeline and then Joe do you want to\u2026.? Joseph Householder : Yeah. And so then we wouldn\u2019t have IEnova build the U.S. side of lines we would actually do that in U.S Gas and Power. As Mark mentioned a little bit earlier talking to Julien because we only own 25% of REX to form an MLP we would need some other assets that are slightly larger than the value of REX because there of the [inaudible] investment company rule and so we need some other assets. I am very excited about REX. I said that at the conference and this new announcement is great because it really enables us to look hard at that and I mentioned that we have some other assets related to our LNG plant in Mexico that creates some U.S. income. Looking at that and then looking to ability to put these pipelines from the CFE bids that are in the U.S and whether we funded from U.S gas and power or whether we use \u2013 of the IPO to fund it we can look into that further but first we have to win those bids but this is a very exciting momentum for us with REX. Gabe Moreen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. And then thinking I guess on the topic of REX, it\u2019s a two part question. One, clarifying which is to stay the matching ability on bids, does that mean $0.50 goes higher for all shippers, if indeed incremental shippers come in at higher than $0.50 or does that just mean existing shippers have the chance to match on capacity? And then second on the Analyst Day I think there was implied there was a decent amount of hydraulic flexibility around the size of a REX reversal. So I am just curious around the 1.2, I guess given other producer and midstream commentary on the need to get gas out of the Utica and the Marcellus I think imply that the REX reversal may not even be enough, the flexibility to go to an even higher capacity if you get more interest? Debra Reed : Yeah we had talked about and I\u2019ll have Mark go through the detail of how the open season works. But what we had talked about at the Analyst Conference is that there have been like 5.5Bs of interest in the REX reversal and so there is a high level of interest. What we have in place is 1.2B\u2019s of signed contracts at the $0.50 that they come to base point for the open season. Mark? Mark Snell : Yeah to answer your question specifically we went out and obviously canvassed potential parties and got commitments for 1.2Bs at $0.50 if somebody comes in and wants additional capacity than the existing holders have the right to match that price so the $0.50 effectively becomes kind of a floor but at the end of the day we kind of expect that to be the price. So there could be a little bit of an uptick but I think for our modeling and stuff we are using $0.50. And then to the other question yes, we can expand the East-West capacity of REX beyond the 1.2. The question is as you start to expand it further you get into certain additional compression but also you get this pretty quickly to where you have to start doing some looping which gets very expensive and so the question is are we still the most cost effective solution and we\u2019re looking at it and so everyone will certainly study it but I would expect we\u2019re not putting anything in our plans right now for that and we\u2019re just really focused on getting this 1.2 signed up and moving forward on that. And then we\u2019ll look to see if we\u2019re cost effective for the shippers on doing any further expansion, could be that we are but we\u2019re just starting to study that now. Gabe Moreen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi guys, congrats on a good quarter. Debbie I wanted to ask I went through the filing, the proposed decision in California and there was some language in there honestly I almost felt like I was reading another utilities language in some of the other PSEP related proceedings going on because but there was language about potential cost that will be borne by the shareholder not the rate payer and pipe record that haven\u2019t been tapped and pipelines that you can\u2019t really prove they\u2019ve been inspected or not is and to be honest I\u2019m not sure I understood a whole lot of it when it came to the Sempra side effect of it. So could you kind of walk us through your interpretation of what some of those components of the PD means and what the cost implications in kind of the rate payer versus the shareholder implications are? Debra Reed : Sure I\u2019ll try to do the best I can on that, if you read the decision then you\u2019ll also see that is very hard to interpret and there\u2019s some contradictory elements and we\u2019re going to filing comments on May 5th and trying to get some of that cleaned up. What the decision basically does is it goes back to 1956 and it says that any pipeline that they set they feel that should have been tested from 1956 and beyond where you haven\u2019t tested or you don\u2019t have complete records of testing, that a shareholder should be responsible for the test and the test component of that. And we think we have some really good evidence that, that was even inconsistent with the policy at that time. In fact we have CPUC policy statements on the record dating back to 1950 where they said that utilities were not required to meet voluntary standards and that they were not going to be funded. So these are things that I think are in contention right now in the decision. If we look at the decision in entirety and you look at the fact that we can expedite some of the other phases that even if we look at the decision as it stands today we think we can be consistent with the plan that we showed you in March. But we do feel like we have a really strong case for getting some of these things modified. And you will see that, I hope you read our comments on May 6th when we file them and you see that\u2019s the case that we have that shows that really this first time there were standards put in place was in 1961 and SoCalGas and SDG&E had a very, very few miles of pipe that were installed post 1961, that we don\u2019t have complete records on. So I think that\u2019s hopefully that\u2019s where we end up on this. But you\u2019ll see some very strong comments from us. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great, thank you on that, one real quick Joe on Chile and the tax implications, just curious if all of it got implemented tomorrow morning, I know it\u2019s not, I know it\u2019s going to be a long-term multi-year process but how would you think about what the net income or EPS impact would be if all components of the tax change happens in the 2014 timeframe, I\u2019m just trying to quantify what the net income or EPS at risk is here? Joseph Householder : Yeah we haven\u2019t tried to quantify because there are so many unknowns about how that tax is going to work and what we might be able to do structurally around it. And so we\u2019re kind of just focused on the next year or two is going to have a 1% or 2% increase in the next few years and that\u2019s only a few million. If this additional tax does get enacted we just need to know more about the rule really to try to figure that out. You can make some assumptions with math but we haven\u2019t tried to do that for you. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay and then finally the REX reversal contract when would that actually go into place? Debra Reed : It would go, well it would become effective, the contract\u2019s effective but the actual line would go into place in June 2015, is the timeframe. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Meaning the reversal and therefore the revenue flow back to REX equity? Debra Reed : Yeah. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it, thank you Debbie, much appreciated. Debra Reed : Thanks Michael. Operator : Thank you and our next question will come from Faisel Khan from Citi. Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi: Good afternoon. Debra Reed : Hi Faisel. Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi: Hey guys, on REX just wondering would the binding opportunity you guys had was there \u2013 did you have the solicit any sort of term back capacity so did reverse shippers \u2013 would the existing shippers sort of allowed to turned back to capacity in order to make room to the reversal or do these sort of contracts still stick until they run out at the end of decade? Debra Reed : Yeah I\u2019m going to turn it to Mark. Mark Snell : We had a FERC hearing on those issues and we were successful and FERC agreed that in that zone the shippers don\u2019t have any right to those revenues or the ability to do that. Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi: Okay, got it. And then just on guidance, was the Copper Mountain sort of gain on sales, is that included in your guidance before and is the sale of the wind assets in Mexico, the 50% interest, is that also, is that gain also been baked into your guidance? Debra Reed : Yeah on any of the gains or costs like that we would incur entering into these partnerships on renewables are in our guidance to the extent that we can expect them and as you remember last December we talked to you about ESJ that we thought we would be towards the low end of our ranges of that time because ESJ was delayed because it was in our plan for last year. And so ESJ and Copper Mountain 3 were both in our plans for this year. It\u2019s part of our business model where we sell 50% down, a lot of that is recouping the development cost that we already expensed during the course of the time for these projects. So it\u2019s always in our guidance if we know that we\u2019re intending to sell an asset like that. Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi: Okay, got it. Debra Reed : In the renewable \u2013 and I would say, in the renewable space. Like Mesquite is not in our guidance because that is not something that\u2019s a typical business model for us but the turn of these renewable projects is selling off 50%, we always put that in our guidance. Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi: Okay understood on SoCalGas the transportation volumes seems to be down pretty in a very large amount of way over last year is there anything associated with that except for just weather or\u2026? Debra Reed : I would say it\u2019s probably the weather. We\u2019ve had an endless summer in California it\u2019s like 90 degrees here today. So there\u2019s nothing fundamentally different in the business as we see it I think it\u2019s mainly weather. Mark Snell : Yeah. Residential volumes were down and so Edison\u2019s electric volumes were probably down and the power points were not used as much. Debra Reed : Yeah. I don\u2019t think anyone had their heater on in California, at least in southern California there has been high C\u2019s and it\u2019s been so warm, yeah. Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi: Yeah. Fair enough. On Mexico \u2013 on the Los Ramones and the Sonora pipelines, as those sort of ramp up at the end of this year, what\u2019s going to be the \u2013 I mean how are they going to ramp up, like what\u2019s the \u2013 how much gas are they going to pull from the U.S. as those facilities ramp up? Is it \u2013 is it sort of they are going to hit capacity right away or is it going to be the slow sort of movement in volumes as they get connected to some of these pipelines. Mark Snell : Well. I think the actual volume of gas flowing probably will ramp up because not all of the infrastructure is in place. But we will get paid. We\u2019ve got a firm capacity arrangement essentially, so we will get paid as if it was running full. Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi: Oh, sure I understand. I was just trying to figure out kind of the magnitude of the flow across the border? Mark Snell : It will be slower at first I don\u2019t \u2013 I can probably get you those numbers if you are interested and get back to you on it. But I just \u2013 I don\u2019t know off the top of my head exactly what the ramp up will be. Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi: Okay. Yeah that would be great if we get a chance to do that. And then just on in Mexico too on the ethane pipeline, the LPG terminal in Guadalajara, what\u2019s the sort of plan for that, I mean is there a, is there opportunity to expand that pipeline, is that part of the whole infrastructure de-bottlenecking and expansion plans for Mexico? Mark Snell : Yeah. It\u2019s not listed as some expansion project in the list that we\u2019ve gotten but there is obviously if we get more petrochemical plants down there and things \u2013 there is an opportunity there. But I think right now it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not counting on it. Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi: Okay, got it. I appreciate. Thanks for the time guys. Debra Reed : Thank you, Faisel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kit Konolige from BGC Financials. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials : Good morning. Debra Reed : Hi, Kit. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials : Just a very brief question. On SONGS what are you guys anticipating as far as timing on \u2013 hearing from NEIL and on the arbitration with MHI and what would the economics and accounting look like if there is some recovery from one or both of those? Debra Reed : Okay, well the timing on \u2013 we are supposed to hear something back, at least what NEIL has indicated this summer about their response to the claims that have been made. And then the MHI arbitration is likely to take a couple of years. We won\u2019t even probably be appearing before the arbitrator for a year or something. So that will take some period of time. Under the settlement provision there is a sharing mechanism for third-party recoveries where based upon the amount recovered that the \u2013 get a certain amount and the shareholders get a certain amount. And none of that has been recorded at all. Anything that we would get in that would be upside. We don\u2019t have anything in our plan about any recoveries about, that would be all upside. Mark Snell : Yeah. The first thing that happens is we recover the legal fees that we had paid out so that would go like earnings because we are already recording those expenses. And then as Debbie said it would be upside it would go to reduce the losses that we took earlier. So we would just have income for the amount that came to us. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials : Okay. That\u2019s great. And just to kind of clarify in a few sentences maybe, just to go back through how we should view the potential for an MLP, if I can characterize it obviously Cameron would be, I guess the key asset. It sounds as though \u2013 well let me ask you it this way if you were to win one or more of the U.S. pipes in the Mexican bidding would you be able to put the potential asset if you will into an MLP and start an MLP say in 2015, if that \u2013 along with REX say if that were to be when the bids were held? Debra Reed : There is a lot of what ifs there. But REX is a great asset. As we\u2019ve said that it is not an asset that could stand alone in an MLP. The pipelines we\u2019re going to service in 2016 or 2017 according to the schedule that\u2019s been published by the government. And so when those start if we were to get one or more of those and they were cash flowing in that period of time then that would be something we would definitely look at as a potential bridge strategy consistent with what we told you at the Analyst Meeting, because those assets have the same type of characteristics as Cameron. They will be long-term contracted. And one of the things we don\u2019t want to do is to form an MLP with assets that don\u2019t have the same kinds of value enhancing characteristics like Cameron that would trade at low yield. So if all of those things happen we would certainly look at it and we would time it based upon how to create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials : And so is it fair to say that the Mexican bidding would be key to forming an MLP or could there be a bridge strategy with only the Mexico, LNG and REX? Debra Reed : I mean we will look at \u2013 I would not say Mexico, the Mexican pipelines in the U.S are one way to form a bridge strategy. There are other ways to form bridge strategies and we have a team looking at all MLP-able assets and what it does to the long-term value if we were to acquire, build or buy any of these assets or companies, what it would do in terms of creating long-term value and comparison to standalone MLP with Cameron and that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll look at it. And we will figure out the combination and the timing that gives us the greatest long-term value. Mark Snell : Yeah. We usually do see the economics are better when we build green field things and buy something. But I think what Debbie just said all the above, we\u2019re looking at all the above. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials : Okay. Good luck with it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Mark Barnett from Morningstar Equity Research. Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Inc.: Hey, good morning everyone. Can you hear me over there? Debra Reed : Yes, yeah. We can hear you. Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Inc.: Okay. Debra Reed : Can you hear us? Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Inc.: Yes I can thanks. You talked a lot about what\u2019s going this year in Mexico and lot of it is very exciting. Just one more quick question I guess following-up on that discussion. Outside of the bidding rules for the next slate of projects this year, you had mentioned in some past calls that there are some outstanding uncertainties around maybe rule making and some additional reforms that you are still looking forward to. Could you maybe highlight what some of those might be? Debra Reed : Sure. One of the \u2013 I mentioned earlier that we don\u2019t have anything in our plans in Mexico to do additional electric generation or transmission right now. Those are areas that are opening up and the government has published a list of potential projects to bid on \u2013 those are right in our sweet spot absolutely, those are areas of interest to us that we have not put into any of our plans today. And those are projects that we\u2019re interested in \u2013 they are on the list that the government has published as well to be bid out. The other area I would say and we\u2019re doing some work now is in the gathering and processing. We have done different types of pipelines in Mexico. We\u2019ve built an ethane pipeline as an example. And so we think that this is a great opportunity area for us is to get into the gathering and processing area in Mexico. And so we\u2019re exploring those opportunities. All of the markets are opening up in those areas. So it\u2019s not just gas pipelines for us, it\u2019s electric transmission electric generation gathering and processing, all of those are great opportunity areas. And I think in the energy sector that there was something like $600 billion of projects identified over the next five years in Mexico. I would see us going after a very large share of that and aggressively going after a very larger share of that. Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Inc.: All right thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. At this time we have one question remaining in the queue. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our next question from Vedula Murti from CDP Capital. Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital : Good morning out there, good afternoon here, how are you? Debra Reed : Hi. I will say hi, that\u2019s easy. Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital : Yeah, that\u2019s fine. To follow up a little bit on your conversation with [Ticon] or whatever. What\u2019s your how you evaluate it when you look at everything, all different permutations that would impact? What\u2019s your opinion about how [inaudible] OGE kind of put their structure together what Davin did with cross tax in term of trying to accelerate things and that type of thing. Is that something that based on what you\u2019ve seen and how the value realization has kind of read through so far something that you grew positively or do you feel like it\u2019s something that can slow is paramount or how should we think about how are you thinking about those specifics? Debra Reed : Well I will tell you how we are thinking generally I am not going to comment on any other companies or their transactions. But the way that we think about it is we have an exceptional asset with Cameron when that goes online that has natural drop down, we think would trade at a very low yield and would be an amazing MLP. That if we do a bridge strategy we would not wanted to diminish the value of that long term asset or an MLP. But there is a possibility that how something might be structured could increase the value in a bridge strategy. And if we found assets that we thought would trade as comparable kinds of yield and that they would allow us to have higher splits by doing it earlier we are absolutely not adverse to doing that. But we are not going to just go out and buy something that is going to trade very differently than Cameron would likely trade and diminish the value of a high value asset in the long term and that\u2019s the way we would generally look at it. Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital : Okay and just to follow up then on that which I completely agree with, given your probably quickly well along into this evaluation, can you characterize how you think the probability is that a bridge strategy that meets your criterion can materialize at least or do you feel like there is something that you see that has a chance to actually meet these criterion which I completely agree with and wouldn\u2019t want to dilute anything. So I am just are you optimistic about that? Or how are you thinking about those? Debra Reed : I am always optimistic. And I think that there is a lot of infrastructure that\u2019s needed in the U.S. and so there are opportunities for us to look at but I wouldn\u2019t want to handicap it. And the good thing is we have an incredible fall-back position with Cameron and the assets around Cameron. And so I wouldn\u2019t want to handicap that, but I think there is a lot of opportunities happening in the United States right now in terms of infrastructure. Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital : Okay. Thank you very much. Debra Reed : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Reed I would like turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Debra Reed : Well thank you all for joining us today on the call. As always our incredible investor relations staff will be there to answer any of the follow-up calls that you have after. So call Rich or Kendall or Amanda with any follow-up questions and have a wonderful day. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Richard A. Vaccari: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's second quarter 2014 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 7, 2014, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 3 and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed: Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. On this call, we will discuss our second quarter financial results and provide you with key operating and regulatory updates. This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $269 million or $1.08 per share. Together with the outlook for the second half of the year, we expect to be at or above the midpoint of our 2014 guidance. Given our strong operating performance and success in delivering planned projects on schedule, combined with the progress we're making on capturing some of those additional development opportunities, we are on track to achieve our 9% to 11% growth rate through 2019. Notably, our Cameron Liquefaction project has achieved several key milestones, and we expect to begin construction this year as planned. On June 19, we received our FERC order, and yesterday, we executed the financing documents and made the final investment decision with our partners. In Mexico, IEnova is on schedule to place and service the first phases of the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines by year-end. We are extremely proud that since January 2013, IEnova is the best performing IPO in the Americas and the second best-performing IPO worldwide. In Peru, commissioning of the Santa Teresa Hydro project will begin this month. In the U.S., REX East-to-West loads of 1.8 Bcf per day are now fully contracted. Also, this past week, we signed a power purchase agreement with Edison for a 94-megawatt expansion at our Copper Mountain Solar facility. On the regulatory front, our California utilities received a positive final PSEP decision in June. We are also continuing to work on the development projects that could provide additional upside to our 5-year plan and sustain our superior growth rate. Examples include LNG, natural gas pipelines, renewables and hydro in Peru and we will talk about these projects later in the call. Now let me hand things to Joe to discuss the second quarter results in more detail starting with Slide 4. Joe? Joseph A. Householder: Thanks, Debbie. Sempra's second quarter consolidated earnings were $269 million or $1.08 per share. This compares to adjusted earnings of $258 million or $1.04 per share in the same quarter last year. Moving to guidance. As Debbie just mentioned, we now expect to be at or above the midpoint of our 2014 guidance of $4.25 per share to $4.55 per share. Let me elaborate a bit on what this guidance range includes. Consistent with our development and partnership model for renewables, we include the promote we recorded on the CMS 3 project in the first quarter and the promote we will record on ESJ next quarter for the formation of these joint ventures. We also now include the $9 million additional charge we recorded in the first quarter related to the SONGS settlement agreement. However, we do not include any possible gain on the sale of the remaining block of our Mesquite combined cycle power plant, nor do we include anything for the tax reform proposals being discussed in Chile. Before proceeding to earnings for each of the business units, I would like to also mention one timing-related factor I discussed on last quarter's call. Remember that in the first quarter of 2013, we recorded a $63 million deferred tax expense related to the IEnova IPO restructuring. In the first quarter of 2014, we recorded $12 million of estimated deferred tax expense to reflect a portion of the planned repatriation for this year. We recorded another $12 million of deferred tax expense in the second quarter of 2014. Our estimated annual tax rate reflects the recording of deferred tax expense each quarter in accordance with the full year as planned repatriation. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for details on SDG&E. At SDG&E, earnings for the second quarter were $123 million, up from adjusted earnings of $115 million in the second quarter of 2013. We are really very pleased with this result as the increase was due primarily to higher CPUC-based margin and improved operating performance. Please turn to Slide 6. For SoCalGas, second quarter earnings were $80 million. Compared with the second quarter of 2013, SoCalGas had $9 million in higher CPUC-based margin and improved operating results. Offsetting items included a higher tax benefit in the second quarter of last year and certain cost to our Pipeline and Safety Enhancement Plan, or PSEP. Specifically, we incurred $6 million of PSEP costs in prior periods that were denied recovery in the final PSEP decision. Now let's move to Sempra International on Slide 7. At our South American utilities, second quarter earnings were $42 million, up from earnings of $34 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase was due in part to higher operating earnings from growth in customers and energy sales combined with reduced costs. In addition, we had a $4 million loss in the second quarter of last year from the sale of our investments in Argentina. For Sempra Mexico, second quarter earnings were $34 million versus earnings of $26 million in the same period last year. $11 million of AFUDC equity earnings in the second quarter largely accounts for this increase. As you will recall, we began recording AFUDC equity on the Sonora pipeline since it is an asset that has a regulated rate of return and qualifies for regulatory accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. Partially offsetting the AFUDC earnings was the effect of foreign currency translation on deferred tax balances in the second quarter of 2013. Now please turn to Slide 8. At Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $4 million in the second quarter of 2014. Second quarter earnings are lower this year compared with last year due primarily to mark-to-market gains on our gas storage positions in the second quarter of 2013. Second quarter earnings for the Renewable segment were $18 million versus $15 million in the same period last year. The increase is largely attributable to higher operating performance and deferred tax benefits for assets currently being placed in service. With that, let me hand the call back to Debbie to discuss Slide 9. Debra L. Reed: Thanks, Joe. Now we will give you an update on our major businesses starting with LNG. As I mentioned earlier, on June 19, we received the FERC order authorizing construction and operation of our Cameron Liquefaction project. In July, FERC provided Cameron with a notice to proceed on site separation activities. Now that all FERC hurdles have been cleared, the only remaining significant regulatory step is receipt of the final DOE non-FTA permit, and we expect to receive this permit and begin construction later this year as planned. Yesterday, with our partners, we also executed the financing documents and completed all requirements for making the final investment decision, commonly referred to as FID. Financing commitments for the project totaled $7.4 billion and will be provided by JBIC and a group of 29 international commercial banks, some of whom are insured by NEXI. Cameron received 16-year financing and highly competitive pricing due to the quality of its lenders, sponsors and customers. The transaction represents one of the largest project financings in U.S. history. Now please turn to Slide 10. At our Analyst Conference in March, we discussed our interest in growing our LNG business. We are continuing efforts in this area with an initial focus on expanding existing assets. For our Cameron facility, now that we have reached FID, we will begin working with our partners to complete the development plans and initiate the FERC process for trains 4 and 5. We believe the Cameron expansion will be one of the lower cost alternatives, especially when compared to greenfield development. Our ECA LNG plant in Mexico is also well situated from a market perspective as the only brownfield facility on the West Coast. We are focused on determining the critical path items that would influence the feasibility and size of a potential export facility at ECA. These include issues around gas supply and delivery, customer interest, existing contracts and regulatory requirements. A positive development is that Mexican energy reform legislation now includes a basic framework for private sector LNG export. In addition to ECA, we are assessing design options and feasibility for our potential Port Arthur facility in Texas. We will provide updates on our progress periodically and are optimistic about our ability to grow our LNG business with Sempra's existing assets and capabilities. Now please turn to Slide 11. Our U.S. Gas & Power business has 2 other projects update. On the REX pipeline, the 1.8 Bcf per day of existing East-to-West capacity is now fully contracted. REX put a portion of this capacity in service in June, and the full capacity will be in service by next summer. All of this capacity, except 0.2 Bcf per day, represents the capture of development opportunities additional to our 5-year plan. On July 31, U.S. Gas & Power also executed a power purchase agreement with Edison for a 94-megawatt expansion of our Copper Mountain Solar complex. For this project, we would expect to achieve commercial operation by the end of 2016 and have a 50% ownership share. Under the agreement, Edison would purchase power beginning in 2020. Now please turn to Slide 12. Moving to Sempra Mexico. The initial phases of the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines are both on budget and on schedule to be in service by year-end. Each represents an investment of around $500 million. IEnova secured financing in June for the 155-megawatt ESJ wind project, and in July, they finalized the sale of 50% of the project to Energen. Regarding development projects under Mexico's 5-year infrastructure plan, official bid documents for the first 2 natural gas pipelines have been published. The first project is about 155 miles and will eventually connect with one of the proposed pipelines to be constructed in the United States. The second project is about 260 miles in northern Mexico. Tenders for these projects are due in October, and IEnova is preparing to participate in both bids. The 2 projects together would likely represent investments of over $1 billion. In addition to these 2 projects, 3 pipelines in the U.S. and 5 more pipelines in Mexico are planned to be tendered in 2014. Opportunities in other sectors will also be bolstered by the energy reform efforts that just passed. As one of the largest energy companies in Mexico, we are looking forward to the opportunities that energy reform will bring in sectors such as liquids transportation, gathering and processing, and power transmission. Now turning to Peru. We expect to begin commissioning of the 100-megawatt Santa Teresa Hydro project this month. Building upon our success with this project, we are exploring several additional hydro opportunities in the country. Luz del Sur has been granted a temporary concession on the hydropower project, Santa Teresa II, with a potential design capacity between 250 and 300 megawatts. We are progressing on environmental and feasibility studies and have begun conducting local outreach. Additionally, in southern Peru, we are assessing feasibility and design of 2 hydropower projects that can provide a combined capacity of around 350 megawatts. All 3 hydro projects are potentially large, technically sound investments, and we intend to make a decision on moving forward on these by early next year. Now please turn to Slide 13 for an update on our California utilities. SDG&E and SoCalGas have both been making important headway on several regulatory issues. On June 12, we received the final PSEP decision. The decision is favorable in that it adopts our overall implementation framework and approves a process for cost recovery and balancing account treatment, subject to a reasonableness review. This decision covers expenditures in populated areas, and consistent with what we reported at our analyst conference, capital expenditures are estimated to be about $1.5 billion through 2018. On July 25, we submitted a notice of intent to file the 2016 General Rate Cases for both SDG&E and SoCalGas. After CPUC staff reviews these submissions, the utilities expect to file an official application in the fourth quarter of 2014. The CPUC's final decision is scheduled for late 2015. Now let's finish by turning to Slide 14. In summary, we are on track for another strong year. We expect to be at the midpoint or higher of our 2014 earnings guidance. Our core businesses are performing well. We received a positive PSEP decision at our California utilities, and are on schedule with our major projects like Cameron LNG and our Mexican pipelines. We are also making great headway on some of our development opportunities. REX has additional contracted volumes and we are seeing many opportunities for growth emerging in both Mexico and Peru. With that, let me stop and take any questions that you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So first, can we discuss REX here for a second, in the context of what's in the 5-year plan versus outside? Could you give us a little bit of a sense, what does 25% mean, just if you could define that? And then also regarding the non-binding open season, where is that shaking out as far as you've received interest, if you could comment a little bit more, if you wouldn't mind? Debra L. Reed: Okay. I'll start, and we did put a slide in the package because we do understand the REX issues are kind of confusing. So if I could refer you to the slide and the slide number is 17. I think that would help you understand what's in and what's not in the plan. So let me kind of walk you through that. If you look at the Seneca lateral piece of that, that's 0.6 Bcf, and about 0.25 Bcf of that went into service in June of this year. That piece was in our plan. We expected that to happen. That was in our 5-year plan. But what has now been contracted is an additional $1.6 billion in addition to that, and that comes in over phases. The next phase of that is another $400 million or so that will come in at the end of this year and provide some upside to our plan in next year and beyond. And then the remaining 1.2 Bcf comes into service in the middle of next year. And that is, again, incremental to what we had in our 5-year plan. So this is a really positive thing for us, just with what we have under contract. In addition to that, there was a non-binding open season that was conducted in May, and that we're in negotiations with parties on the results of that. And we will announce the results of that when we've concluded those negotiations which are underway right now. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. Is there a timeline on the negotiations? Debra L. Reed: I would say within the next couple of months, we would anticipate something coming out. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. And then... Debra L. Reed: And again, I would just say, none of that was in the plan. So whatever that is, that was not in the plan either. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Excellent. And then moving back to the LNG side of the equation. Could you comment a little bit on where you stand on incremental contracts for both of the projects, 4, 5 and ECA? And perhaps specifically, kind of where you sit in the decision, FTA versus non-FTA? Debra L. Reed: Yes, what I'm going to do is I'll just give you a high level, and then I'm going to turn it to Mark to go through kind of project-by-project and what we're looking at there. I would say, the great thing that we have is that when we look at our Cameron facility, it is a very commercially-viable facility. It's -- we think, it's really well positioned in the marketplace, and we also believe our ECA facility would be very well positioned in the marketplace. So a lot of effort is underway to look at kind of the next steps at those facilities, and then we have this wonderful location with Port Arthur, and what might we be able to do with that. So we are very focused on kind of the next steps, and let me turn it to Mark to talk a little bit about that. Mark A. Snell: Okay. Well, with respect to Cameron, I think, as Debbie says, a great facility. I think the thing I would add to that, too, is the partners in this -- in the facility are world-class trading partners with extensive LNG businesses. So while we have not signed contracts yet for trains 4 and 5, we're really just beginning, just starting to think about that as we have completed FID and move forward with the constructions of trains 1 through 3. So I think that the next step for us is to talk with our partners, decide how much capacity everybody would like, and then to see if we're going to market any of it out to other parties. And that hasn't really begun yet, but I think that is something that will be in the works now that we're moving forward with FID. And I would just say with that facility too is there are -- the big point here is that, that facility, along with our ECA facility being brownfield sites, obviously, have a cost advantage and a construction advantage over any of the greenfield sites. So it's our expectation that the market will look to brownfield sites, ours included, but also including others and expansion of those existing facilities, first, before they really look at a lot of greenfield opportunities. With respect to ECA, we are undergoing studies right now to determine the amount of gas that's available for the facility and the cost of delivering that gas into the facility. And then once we kind of determine that, which we think will take us towards the end of this year, once we determine that, we'll lay out some plans for the size of the facility and start marketing to customers. We have a lot of customer interest, and we don't think that acquiring customers will be a big issue, but we haven't started that marketing yet because we haven't sized the facility, but we're in the process of looking at the parameters to do that. And then with respect to Port Arthur, another -- it's a great site, it is a greenfield site. We think the advantage of Port Arthur is that it's such a large site and has such good water access that the possibility of doing things beyond just LNG are there. We can -- there's other -- it's actually been proposed in the past as a crude terminal and other types of activities, and we think those activities could coexist with LNG, making it, in the long run, one of the more cost-effective greenfield sites in the country. So those are all, kind of, positives and where we're going, and then did you, Debbie, you want to comment on the process? Debra L. Reed: Yes. You asked the question, Julien, about the DOE, non-conditional FTA. And going through the conditional FTA was really where the review, the extensive review occurred with DOE. So we would anticipate in the next few months to see the DOE, non-conditional FTA. We've seen, recently, other companies get their conditional FTAs. We haven't seen any change in criteria, so we would expect that to be coming out in the next couple of months. And then, that would allow us to begin, really, full construction on the site. But we are doing some site preparation activities. We've gotten the authority from FERC to be able to do that. And so, we're, actually, working on the site right now. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: A couple questions. First, just with the final financing terms and the like, are all the numbers you've given for Cameron 1 through 3 still, kind of, right in line with what you've said before? Debra L. Reed: Yes. We did -- and I think a couple of things, Steve. We've given you the range of $9 billion to $10 billion. We're still in that range. And we looked at the financing, the financing came in very competitively, as I mentioned in my comments. What we're looking at now is, at the $10 billion range, being somewhere towards the middle of the range that we've given you, for the first few years of operation. And then as the loan starts to be amortized, we would anticipate that, over time, the annual earnings would be $400 million or so. So $300 million to $350 million is still a range we would see being closer to the midpoints of that range in the first few years of operation, and then we would see being in excess of $400 million after the loan starts to amortize. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And then just -- what's the -- just to set expectation, what's a reasonable timeframe to think about potential contracting of trains 4 and 5? Debra L. Reed: I can't really answer that question. I will tell you that it's something that is a big focus for us, and that we're going to put a lot of energy into it, just like we did getting Cameron done. But that -- you got to get -- you got to do the same things we went through Cameron. And the good thing is we've been through the FERC process on that site, so it's not a new site to go through the FERC process. So, kind of, telling you a timeframe on that, I can't tell you. I'm hoping it would be expedited because we've already been through the FERC process on that site, but I really can't give you a timeframe at this point. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And then just one last question on the -- you've given your 3 kind of scenario options on MLP back at the Analyst Day. Any new thinking on those 3 options or is it pretty consistent with what you said then? Debra L. Reed: Yes, let me have Joe talk about that because we continue to do work in this area. And clearly, with the situation with REX being as positive as it is, we constantly are looking at that. So let me ask Joe to hit that. Joseph A. Householder: Thanks, Debbie, and Steve, thanks for the question. As she said, it's some subject that we spend a fair amount of time on because it's very important to us and to the shareholders. And we're looking at the MLP space and the YieldCo space, actually, and the ones that have the highest visible growth, particularly, with large drop-down portfolios, those have the lowest yields and the potential for the highest value. And so let me tell you a little bit more about that we really are doing. We're continuing to evaluate the value proposition and we're studying the legal and financial aspects of both the MLP and the YieldCo space. And as we've noted before, having the clear growth strategy for the business is a critical element. So we're very excited about our growth at Sempra and focused on executing, as Debbie said, on all these projects that we're doing. At the same time, we're focused on getting the best market value for the shareholders on this growth and that current MLP YieldCo structure offer good opportunity for that. So we haven't made a decision at this time, which of the structures is exactly the right one, but we are very focused on it and looking at it and continuing to evaluate all of these opportunities. Debra L. Reed: I would just add to that. We'll look at that in conjunction also, with the timing, and as I've said before, part of the analysis is looking at, with an asset as valuable as Cameron, how does the timing set, with splits and things like that? So all of that kind of analytical work is part of our assessment. Operator : We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon of ISI Group. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : The first couple of questions checked a lot off my list so I'll try to be brief. I'll probably fail, but I'll try to be brief. So thinking about when the revenues are rolling in on the stuff that's not in your plan. You've been very clear that 2015, 2016, there's 1 point more Bcf a day of revenue opportunity off of the REX backhaul that wasn't in the plan. Should we assume that -- should the Clarington West open season become a commercially viable opportunity that, that would hit in the second half of '15? Or is it hitting the first half of '16 in terms of incremental revenue? What's the timing assumed on the current path to bringing that into the revenue line? Debra L. Reed: The timing on the current path is sometime in the middle of 2015 as that is -- it's expected to go in service. And I think, just go through the increments again to be sure the numbers that you have are consistent. We have $200 million to $250 million in service now, and that was in the plan. We add, incrementally, $350 million to $400 million at the end of this year, and that's additive to the plan. And then, we would add the remainder to get to the $1.8 billion, which is another $1.2 billion in the middle of next year some time. Joseph A. Householder: And I think you might have been asking [indiscernible]. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : [indiscernible] on the Clarington West? Debra L. Reed: And then on the Clarington West, the timeframe on that is not certain because with that -- a lot of that has to do with how you design it, and what the volumes are and how you design it. So we don't know what the timeframe of that would be. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Right. And Clarington West, if it's successful, would require more capital investment than the Seneca lateral and the $1.2 billion that you've already signed up, correct? Debra L. Reed: Yes. There would be compression for one piece of it, and then there would be looping for the other piece of that. And for what we've done so far, the capital is really not very large at all, I think it was like $70-some-odd million, $80 million. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And the maximum size of Clarington West was another $2.4 billion? Is that -- or am I overstating it? Debra L. Reed: No, that's right. That was the maximum size if you do compression and looping. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And then, I have one question back on the utility. You gave guidance for a range of earnings for SoCalGas of $360 million to $390 million in 2015 at your Analyst Day. I'm wondering, as you now are analyzing the rate decisions you've gotten, for instance, the PSEP decision, where you think you would come out inside that range? Debra L. Reed: Well, the ranges that we gave you in March of this year, we would anticipate being in those ranges for SoCalGas. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : First is just a clarification. Joe, when you said earlier you're looking at different options for structures, were you saying that you're considering doing a YieldCo and having Cameron be a part of that? Joseph A. Householder: I was saying that we're open -- we're looking at all of that. We're trying to determine what vehicle might, exactly, be the best, and we are keeping our options open as to what the right vehicle is. So at this point, it's open. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then, hypothetically, if you did go, sort of, down the YieldCo-type route, what other assets in your portfolio do you think would fit well? Obviously, you've got the renewables, but do any other assets come to mind? Joseph A. Householder: That would be probably the primary asset other than the ones that we've spoken about before that would go into an MLP. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. What about some of the, like the Latin American assets you have. There have been a couple of YieldCos with those type of assets. Joseph A. Householder: We've spoken about it a little, we haven't really done much analysis on it. It's a lot more complicated, obviously. And inside the utility, it probably wouldn't fit that well, but it's certainly something that we are keeping an open mind about. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, great. And then in terms of -- there was a pipeline that was bid, I think, in Peru a couple of months back, and I think you were disqualified or there were some sort of issues. I was hoping you can provide an update there and just some color on what happened? Debra L. Reed: Yes. I'm going to have Mark talk about what happened with that. Mark A. Snell: Okay. Well, what happened was we were in a competitive bidding situation and we were in a consortium with other bidders -- I mean, with other participants in our consortium. And one of our members at the last -- kind of, at the last moment decided to change ownership percentages, and that caused us to have a technical disqualification. And so our bid was rejected, although we did open it publicly and announced it, and it was the best bid, it was the low bid, so I think would have won. And it was just unfortunate that we had this, sort of, technical problem that caused our bid to be disqualified. But I think it gave us a lot of encouragement in the sense that having gone through this process on this pipeline, and there's other projects coming up, that we were obviously very competitive. We came up with the lowest price. We think we had a better route and a better approach to the project. And so I think we're sort of emboldened to think that we're going to be very -- quite competitive in the future. It's unfortunate we have this little setback. But I think, moving forward, we look upon this, our group, as positively, as one that we can win projects down there. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And just one last question, if I can. In terms of thinking about the potential economics for an ECA or -- under Cameron 4 and 5, how similar or dissimilar would it be to Cameron 1 through 3, both in terms of the equity investment, as well as the return potential? Mark A. Snell: Well, I'll take that. This is Mark. Obviously, the expansion is less expensive per ton of production than even the brownfield conversion to a certain extent. As you get bigger and bigger, then you start -- then it becomes less effective because you might have to add tankage and stuff. But with what we're considering, I think we would be very cost competitive. So the cost wouldn't be -- would be less than what we're currently contemplating, and I think that's what going to make it very attractive. We would expect similar kinds of returns as we would get. So I think that we would probably share those efficiencies with the market to make sure that we can sell the capacity. So I think those are all positives. And then with respect to ECA, a little different facility there, a little different footprint. But I think, roughly speaking, the economics are somewhat the same, but ECA would likely be a smaller facility or will be a smaller facility. Debra L. Reed: Before I take another question, I just wanted to comment on something back on the REX sheet to be sure everyone was clear. On the sheet that we have at 17, it says 25% of the volumes. I just want to remind everyone that we own 25% of REX. So when we're talking about 1.8 Bcf and 2.4 Bcf, not all of that flows to Sempra. I think you all know that, but I just don\u2019t want to mislead anyone. Okay. We're ready for the next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Tucker of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I guess, I wanted to ask about Mexico first and how you feel about your chances on these 2 CFE pipeline bids and if you could comment on how the competitive environment for these bids compares to other pipeline opportunities that you've gone after there recently? Debra L. Reed: Well, I'll just start by saying that we are really excited about the opportunities in Mexico, and the good thing that we have is we have the infrastructure there, we have the team there, we have the ability to get pipes to the job, we have all of that because we've done projects. So I think that, that -- why competition is probably going to be higher than we saw in the past. I think also being on the ground with the projects that we already have there provides us a great competitive advantage in terms of our ability to show that we can deliver on these projects. And then we have the 2 projects coming in this year that are on schedule, on budget, and there are not very many companies that have that kind of proven track record. So I think we're in really good position to compete, and there's a lot of projects that are going to come out, and we're going to be, as we have in the past, selective of which ones we bid on, the ones that we feel we can be most competitive. Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Great, thanks. And then just circling back to Cameron. You mentioned you expect the final DOE approval within the next couple of months. I guess, what's, kind of, holding that up, and what issues are they still considering? I kind of felt that like would be somewhat automatic. So maybe you could comment on that. Debra L. Reed: Well, like I said within the next couple of months. I mean, we're not sure. It could happen soon, it could happen -- as DOE is looking at it, I think that one of the considerations was what kind of comments would come in on the FERC issue. And since that appears to have been that there were no comments that were filed timely, that, that may change how DOE focuses on it. Certainly, Senator Landrieu has already sent a letter that was made public asking DOE to act quickly on this. And as I said, it's not stopping us from getting on site right now and doing some of that pre-work. But the sooner we can get it, the better. So we're very anxious to have DOE act quickly and hope they will. Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And then with respect to the possible expansion. I guess, I just wanted to ask about the construction side of that. If, hypothetically, you were able to secure commitments and were able to get the permitting process, would you be able to start construction on trains 4 and 5 before trains 1 through 3 are completed, or would you have to wait until, really, 2019 to even start construction? Debra L. Reed: No. I'm going to have Mark talk about how that might unfold. Mark A. Snell: No, I mean, it really -- they have to be kind of done sequentially. And it's not just the construction issue, but also the terms of the financing require us to finish the projects that are being financed first. So unless we redid some of the financing, we -- it's -- they have to be done sequentially. Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : So we'd be talking about something like a 2020-type timeframe, the earliest, 2021 maybe for those to come online? Mark A. Snell: Yes, it could be a little shorter than that. I mean, one of the things we are doing, we are constantly looking at the construction schedule and the construction that we're doing and we, kind of, call it a no-regrets construction policy, which is we're anticipating further expansion as we build. So there are certain things that we can kind of pre-build into the process so that we don't have to go back and redo it. So I think we can save some time there. So it may not be quite as long a timeframe as trains 1 through 3, but it would probably be sequential. Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And then just looking at the 3 LNG expansion opportunities. You discussed Cameron, ECA and Port Arthur. Would you be able to, kind of, rank those in terms of both the probability and the, kind of, timeline between those 3 projects? Mark A. Snell: Well, I think the reality is the expansion of Cameron is probably up there. It's probably first, but very close behind is ECA, and that's, probably, almost a push as to which one could go first. Probably -- actually, ECA could start earlier than the expansion. So I think both of those are, kind of, at least, equal. And then Port Arthur, because it's a greenfield facility, obviously, would take longer to develop, and it could be quite a big facility. So that's further down the road. I'd kind of -- but I'd keep ECA and Cameron, kind of, neck and neck. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I want to ask about the good old-fashioned utilities. When you think about -- right, like nobody's asking, and you have really, really, really strong utilities. When you're thinking about the rate cases, how material? Meaning, how big of a number are we talking about in terms of either requested revenue change or a percentage rate change if you're the -- I don\u2019t know, if you're the intervenor looking at it from the other side? Debra L. Reed: Yes, actually, I think that's the real positive that we have. If you look at SDG&E as example, our filed notice of intent to file the rate case set forth a number of $168 million increase. And on a combined electric and gas build, that's about 1.4%. And then on SoCalGas, we're looking at a $290 million increase, and that's about 5.5% increase in a bill. But I will remind you that in both cases, the bills are already much lower than the national average. So I think that we have operated our utilities efficiently over time. I think there's a benefit in that and going in to these rate cases and asking for what we really need to operate those businesses very efficiently and have it not be huge increases in customer rates. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then one question on Clarington West, kind of, the part that you're still trying to figure out, you and your co-owners are just still trying to figure out what to do with. What's the timeline for the open seasons there? And I want to make sure I understood this, what would be the potential, kind of, range of capital requirements from your perspective? Debra L. Reed: Okay, Mike, I'll answer the first and then I'll ask Mark to talk about the capital requirements under the different phases, if that's public and -- when I'm not sure, I guess, that's not public information. So I won't answer that part of your question. But I will answer the first part of your question. The non-binding open season went out in May and now, we're in negotiations with participants in that non-binding open season relative to contractual commitments. So however long it takes to secure those is the kind of timeframe that we're looking at. And that's why I said I think we would anticipate something in the next couple of months most likely. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Did you guys give more color on the timing of the rest of the 2014 RFPs for the Mexico pipelines? There's a lot left in there besides just the 2 that are out there already, and it looks like each one individually will take a couple months at least from start to finish. Debra L. Reed: Yes, there's 2 that are outstanding right now, and then there's 5 more that they've announced to come out of this year, and that's what's been indicated, and that's in the pipeline side. But I would also focus you on -- there's other areas of opportunity like transmission. And so, Mark why don't you hit, kind of, what we see over the next few months? Mark A. Snell: Okay. I think, well, like Debbie said, there's 2 out right now, and we're actively working on those bids. And then the next 5 that are coming out of those, 2 big ones are in the United States that are for CFE. Those will be, probably, hotly contested just because they are the MLPs and everybody can compete with those. So we expect that to be -- have more bidders than the ones in Mexico. But we do believe that we have some unique things, properties that we can bring to the bid, to our bid, and then -- and I think that we can try to -- we can be competitive, and we should have a good chance to do that. And we've had a long history, obviously, working with the CFE, so I think that should bode well in our favor. But then there's -- and then beyond that, there is a whole list of pipeline opportunities that are scheduled to come in -- to come out in the first half of '15. And obviously, we're even beginning to look at some of those and be prepared for those. But there is, certainly, a long list of opportunities on the natural gas pipeline side. But then we also have -- there are electric transmission projects and power generation projects, also product lines for PEMEX. So I mean, I think, the story here is that energy reform in Mexico is going to produce billions and billions of dollars of capital opportunities for companies that have a history of operating in Mexico, and our positioning with our IEnova subsidiary makes us probably the premier energy company to bid on these competitive projects. We're the second largest energy company in Mexico behind PEMEX, and we're really the hometown incumbent there. So I think we feel very good about our chances of being successful and participating in this reform, and we certainly look forward to continuing to grow our business down there. Debra L. Reed: And just to, kind of, add a flavor of the big numbers we're talking about over time. As part of the infrastructure program that the Mexican government has announced, they've announced 15 generation projects worth $13.6 billion, 17 gas pipelines for $13.1 billion, and 7 electric transmission lines for $1.7 billion. So you're talking about tens of billions of dollars of investment in Mexico. And they're moving forward on it. So we think this is going to be a great opportunity area for us. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then just on cash repatriation. You guys have, I guess, some potential incremental opportunities in Peru after the failure of that initial RFP for the pipeline there, and then certainly all of the opportunities in Mexico. Will there be any pause that you contemplate with brining cash back here as a result of those and how should we think about that and, kind of, what's contemplated in guidance through, I guess, 2018 now, with the repatriation? Debra L. Reed: Yes, what we've had in our plan and what we continue to have in our plan is repatriating $300 million a year. And that -- we look at that based upon the needs of capital in those countries. As we've told you before, we have a lot of debt capacity left, and so that's what we would go to first. And then, we have the ability to issue equity in those 2 countries. We would look at that as well. So right now, what we're planning on is still the $300 million a year repatriation. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kit Konolige of BGC. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : On the possibility of the MLP/YieldCo that, obviously, has been a hot topic that you've talked about and we have asked you about. Any further thinking on any kind of bridge assets that could be put into a hypothetical MLP, let's say, before Cameron was up and running? If I understood you correctly, in the past, REX alone as it was envisioned -- you wouldn't really have considered sufficient to be the, kind of, the lead-off batter for the MLP for that length of time. Debra L. Reed: I'll have Joe talk about this. Joe? Joseph A. Householder: Kit, while we haven't made any decisions at this point about the exact timing or asset composition, I will remind you, what we talked about on the first quarter, the things that are going on at REX that we talked about today and last quarter are really exciting because it does give us additional cash flow starting in the middle of next year that we can use in this regard. However, I did note that because we have a 25% interest in REX, it can't be the only asset that goes in there because of some 40 Act issues, so we need other assets. So what we've talked about is using some of the cash flow from REX, using -- as we get further along, obviously, the cash flows from Cameron, and now that we have FID, that puts us in great stead for that. But we have some additional cash flows from our LNG facility in Mexico that, actually, are in the U.S. and we would use those. We have some other, a little bit of midstream asset revenues not including the storage that we would put in there. And then if we did something broader, we could also include renewable revenues. But I think, given what's happened with REX, given that we now have FID, I think we have a mix of assets that we can use, as you call, sort of, a bridge to do something between now and 2018, 2019. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : So what should we assume is the earliest that you could do something given the mix that you see in front of you there? Is it some time in '15 or '16? Joseph A. Householder: As I started out to say, we haven't made any decisions at this point about the exact timing, so more to come. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : Okay, we'll stay tuned there. Joseph A. Householder: I'll say one other thing. Obviously, we talked about the CFE pipelines in the U.S, Mark spoke about that, and we think we have a good opportunity to capture some of that. That would be an additional help that would get us there. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : Right. And speaking of assets that are being bid out in Mexico. Are -- is it your idea that IEnova would be the owner as those assets are billed or, let's say, for ECA, would there be a different company? Debra L. Reed: Now everything that's located physically in Mexico would be an IEnova position. As Joe said, there are some contracts that relate to gas that are not -- that are tied to ECA but are U.S. assets. Those would remain in the U.S. But to the degree that we developed ECA, to the degree that we're doing pipelines in Mexico, those would be Mexican assets under IEnova. To the degree that some of these Mexican bid pipelines occur in the U.S., those would not be part of IEnova. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : Right. One last question on tax rate. You had some discussion earlier about how the tax rate varies quarter-to-quarter depending on what's repatriated and, obviously, other factors going on, several moving parts. How should we think about the tax rate, say, an annual tax rate over the next few years? Is it going to be pretty steady for estimation purposes? Joseph A. Householder: Yes, over the next several years. This year, it will be just a little under 30, and over the next several years, in the low-30s. Pretty stable. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett of Morningstar. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Sorry to jump back into the LNG. You've been talking about it a lot today. I really appreciate all of your comments on it. Just wondering, it seems the agreement or the nature of the agreement for Cameron is a pretty successful one. If you are going to be moving forward with ECA or with the new Port Arthur facility, are you going to be looking for, kind of, a similar ownership structure? Debra L. Reed: That is yet to be determined. And we'll look at the option that makes sense for each of those facilities. We have great respect and have worked really well with the partners that we have at Cameron, but that model doesn't have to continue on, and we would be looking at what model would make sense for us at each of the facilities. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Meaning, it's possible by the time you're ready to make that decision, you might feel comfortable taking on a project like that on your own? Debra L. Reed: It depends on what kind of contracts we had. And all of that -- all I can say is it really depends. I would not preclude it, but it would have to also fit within our Sempra risk profile, and that's what we would look at. Mark A. Snell: Yes, I would say the thing that we would be focused on is that it would be fully contracted. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And just one smaller thing. At the Analyst Day, you also mentioned the opportunity for some re-gas, maybe in Hawaii. Obviously, not maybe as large an opportunity as some of the stuff you mentioned this quarter, but just wondering if that's something you have an idea about, maybe the capacity that, that market might demand eventually? And that's probably, I would guess, a lower priority than any of the projects that you've spent so much time discussing, already, today? Debra L. Reed: Yes. I would say, I'm going to have Mark talk about it. But I would say, one potential customer probably for ECA would be Hawaii so... Mark A. Snell: Yes, look, I think, the reason we mentioned it is because there is, obviously, a real need there, and this is one of those interesting situations where bringing LNG into the island would do -- would have 2 beneficial effects. One, it would be a much cleaner burning fuel source for electricity because they're using fuel oil now. And two, it would actually lower their costs because they would go from a crude-based pricing to a natural gas-based pricing. So it's really got a double benefit and a clear need, and we think the desire on the part of the Hawaiian -- of the state government and the local utilities there to move with this direction. So we think there's going to be an opportunity there, and ECA is the natural, logical supply source. So that's why it was mentioned. We don't have an agreement. We don't have -- well, we've been talking to them. We think that there's a possibility, someday, of working something out, but we don't have anything. We don't have anything firm. Operator : We'll take our final question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : A lot of my questions have been answered, but just -- I wanted to clarify something on the DOE process. The Chris Smith proposal to, sort of, accelerate the -- to streamline the process and have them deal with the approvals at the end of -- other regulatory agency approvals. I'm sorry if I missed this, what is your expectation in terms of how that's going to proceed? Debra L. Reed: Well, we think that's moving forward, and we're very positive on that. I mean, what we've seen in the queue is that we spent a lot of money going through the FERC process, and that it doesn't cost that much to go through the DOE process for our company, but they can block you in terms of timing for the queue. And that, we really like the idea of the FERC process, kind of, becoming the driver because that's what requires all the engineering, all the environmental work, all the things to really make the business decision on the facility. And we think that this change in process will actually help us in terms of the development of additional size for trains because we've gone through that process. And there -- I will tell you, it is a stringent process, and you can see now that are not very many companies that have made it through the whole FERC process. In fact, we're the first one that made it through the whole EIS process. So we think it's an advantage to us, as a developer, having had the experience with that for them to make those modifications. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Because the reason why bring it up is that, as I'm sure you're aware, API and others made comments that seems to be critical of that path. And I guess, you guys just have a different perspective on it. I'm just wondering if there's a simple -- I don\u2019t want you to go into anything elaborate, but I'm just wondering, is there a simple reason for that or...? Debra L. Reed: Well, [indiscernible] your level of seriousness on these projects is tied to the FERC process. And so, that your expenditures and your level of seriousness -- and with the process that DOE was using with every few months one coming out, you could have projects that may not get developed, may not get the financing, may not have the customers, and have not even begun the FERC process move ahead in the queue because they filed something that didn't cost them anything really to file. And so we think the FERC process, really, drives your true commitment because when you file at FERC, you have invested a lot to get there. And so we're supportive of what DOE is looking at. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, I think I understand the difference. And then on the -- just in general, we've seen some real changes in the global LNG and gas market, et cetera. And I'm just wondering, where things stand now. And obviously, you guys have a competitive advantage with the respect to recent brownfield and stuff. Just in general, what's your thought about, ultimately, how much LNG is actually exported from the country? Or is that -- I'm saying in terms of just any market dynamic outlook, did that change at all from previously, when we've talked about this? Or I'm just, sort of, wondering, when we look at this -- like you said, it seems like everybody's brother's is announcing something, and of course a lot of it isn't, probably, going to happen. I'm just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of flavor as to how you see the recent changes in the gas markets globally? Debra L. Reed: Yes, I'll ask Mark to talk more about this. But what I would say is that all depends on what the relative cost in the market is. And I mean, some of the projects that we're doing now, which are brownfield projects, are very cost competitive. One of the advantages that you have in the U.S. or that you would have in Mexico is that you have an infrastructure, and then a lot of these other places, where they're having to build their LNG facility, they're having to build the pipeline infrastructure, they're having to access the resources to the supply. There's different hurdles that go with it. So we think that our country is really well positioned on this. And it's hard to say how much of that global market we get. I do think that we can be very competitive in that global market because of some of those issues. Mark? Mark A. Snell: Yes, I would say in the near term, say between now and 2020 to 2022, you'll see the development of, probably, the brownfield facilities because those will be the most cost-effective and that could be somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 Bcf to -- just call it 8 to 10 Bcf a day. And I think that's what is probably likely to happen, and then given the size -- and then, I think it'll probably depend a lot on how much the world market is going to grow. I mean, right now we're talking about -- there's some estimates out there that the market for LNG could double over the next 10 or 15 years in the world market, and that, obviously, would create additional opportunities for gas-producing countries. But we've said all along that we don't -- we think other gas-producing countries, especially, ones like Qatar and others that have low-cost reserves, are going to be competitive in this market and they're not just going to seed market share to the U.S. or Canada or the North American market in general on a whim. So at the end of the day, I think, there will be a demand for diversity of supply, which will include North America, and we're going to see other projects get developed and get built. We believe some of those will be ours. But at the end -- but it isn't an unlimited market and clearly, I think we're not approaching it, and I think responsible developers are not going to approach this with the idea that it's never-ending. And so you'll see a lot of proposed facilities, but at the end of the day, we think the actual ones that come online are the ones that will have sold their capacity. And that capacity market is going to be -- it's going to be looking for diversity, it's going to be looking for certainty of supply, and that bodes well for the North American market, and so I think it'll continue to grow. But it's going to be 2022 kind of 10 Bcf a day sort of market and kind of grow from there. Debra L. Reed: I also would say that there's just a lot of things that have been happening in some of the international gas markets that are affecting us. Clearly, what's happening in Russia has a big effect. China just announced that their development of their shale is not progressing as they had anticipated, and it's going much slower and much lower production rates and more expensive. And so I think, those factors will play out over the next 3 to 5 years, where you have greater visibility in those areas, which have a lot of impact on what happens to the LNG market as well. Debra L. Reed: Thank you, all, very much. As always, we have a top-notch Investor Relations team, and that they are there to answer any follow-up questions that you have following our call today. So if you have any additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations group. And thank you so much for joining us today on the call. Operator : This does conclude today's conference.

(Operator Instructions). At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Rick Vaccari : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's third quarter 2014 financial results and business update. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the investor section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team. Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Snell, President, Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I would also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 4th, 2014 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that please turn to slide 3 and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debbie Reed : Thanks Rick and thanks to all of you who are joining us today. Our third quarter earnings were very strong and I am confident that our 2014 earnings will be near the upper end of our guidance range. We are also well-positioned to execute on our five year growth plan. As we begin today, I'd like to start off a little differently by giving you an overview of the progress we are making on key business initiatives and strategies. This will give you a good sense of how we expect to achieve our growth rate of 9% to 11% through 2019. Over the past few months I've been on the road meeting with many of you. Since I most often asked about our long-term growth prospects, I thought it would be helpful to start with a progress update. So today I will begin with a review of some of the projects in our five-year plan and the status of additional development opportunities that could add to our long-term growth. After providing you with this broader context, I'll hand the call over to Joe to discuss the quarterly earnings and then we will take your questions. Please turn to slide 4, for several years we have chartered a path to exit merchant generation as it no longer fits with our long term contracted infrastructure strategy. On October 29th we signed a definitive agreement to sell the last block of Mesquite power plant. The book value of the plant is approximately $300 million and the sale is at a premium to book value. We expect to close this transaction around year-end subject to regulatory approval and transfer of the existing contract. Any gains in the sale is not included in our 2014 guidance. Shifting to our U.S. midstream business, we now have 20 year contracts for the full 1.8 Bcf per day at East to West capacity on the REX pipeline. Due to significant additional demand for capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica, we conducted a nonbinding open season for expansion. The REX joint venture is finalizing precedent agreements with interested shippers and we should be able to report results within a few months. Other market developments that could enhance REX's long-term value include the build out of additional laterals such as the proposed Prairie State Pipeline. Growth in our REX distributions from these recent developments is an important factor as we consider the structure and timing for a potential MLP or YieldCo which we will discuss later on the call. In addition to REX our U.S. Gas and Power business is preparing bids for two natural gas pipeline lines in Texas that are being tendered by Mexico's Electricity Commission, the CFE. We expect to hear the results of those bids early next year. Now, let's turn to slide 5. A significant component of U.S. Gas and Power's natural gas strategy is to leverage our core competencies and asset positions to build a broader LNG business. The progress we have made getting Cameron Liquefaction into construction positions us well to expand our LNG footprint. In October, the joint venture for Cameron became effective. We contributed our asset to the JV and our partners made their initial capital contributions and reimbursed us for their share of development costs. We began drying up on our financing and issued the full notice to proceed to our EPC contractors for construction. The combination of forming the joint venture and moving from the development phase to the construction phase where we have a fixed price turnkey EPC contract is another huge step that gives us confidence the project will be successful and profitable for Sempra. We remain on track to complete all three trains in 2018. Moving to the next steps and growing our LNG business, our U.S. development efforts are progressing on two fronts. We are assessing opportunities to develop Cameron trains four and five and a liquefaction plant at Port Arthur and we continue to receive strong customer interest for both. As we advance our analysis, we will gain more clarity on the prospects and timing for development of these two projects. With regard to Cameron trains four and five, the JV is progressing with a permitting work and we expect to initiate our FERC filing in the first half of 2015. At this time, we would expect to complete the permitting process within about two years after filing. Since trains four and five will likely replicate the current design at Cameron, we may be able to accelerate the environmental review process and shorten approval time frames. Sempra has the contractual rights to 50% of the equity and capacity in the expansion. Unit costs should be comparable to the current project and therefore quite competitive. Our goal is to have the contracts in place and approvals necessary to allow for continuous construction following completion of trains one through three. For those of you who are less familiar with Port Arthur, we have a 2900 acre land position with three miles of waterfront connecting directly to the Gulf of Mexico. The location is on a deep water channel that could accommodate LNG carriers of all sizes. Port Arthur has been permitted in the past for both LNG and crude import facilities. We are assessing the site for the possible combined use of LNG and/or liquids export and are discussing its development with several potential customers. Initial studies suggest the site could reasonably accommodate four trains similar in size to those at Cameron as well as other uses. Our goal is to complete our site plan, negotiate contracts with customers and initiate our FERC filing next year. Now, please turn to slide 6 for developments in our international businesses. In Mexico, we are making progress on our gas studies to determine the size, structure and economics of an LNG export facility at ECA. We should have a better sense of these factors and potential timing in the first half of next year. We continue to see strong interest from potential off-takers, but since this facility is fully contracted as an import facility through 2028, we must consider the impact on contracts with existing customers and the resulting project economics before proceeding. Another infrastructure, IEnova is continuing to meet key construction milestones on its major projects. The first phase of the Sonora pipeline was completed in October and Los Ramones 1 pipeline should be completed in December. Together, they represent about $1 billion in capital expenditure. IEnova is also in the final stages of construction on the ethane pipeline and ESJ wind generation project. Near term development opportunities include the 17 natural gas pipelines outlined in the government's five-year infrastructure plan. Although the process is running a few months behind initial scheduling, the CFE is moving forward and making progress on the tenders. IEnova has submitted a bid for the contracted pipeline and is preparing a bid for the second. As I mentioned, our U.S. Gas and Power business is preparing bids for the third and fourth pipeline. You can refer to the appendix for additional details on all 17. Turning to energy reform, we see a long runway of opportunities resulting from the country's energy transformation. In addition to the $13 billion of investment expected in natural gas pipelines, the government identified $14 billion of power generation projects, $2 billion of electric transmission projects and over $250 billion of energy investments in other sectors. We are working to build upon our past success and become a first mover in several of these new areas of opportunity. While we expect to have increased competition for projects, we\u2019ve worked over many years to develop our competitive advantage in Mexico. For example, IEnova has the largest in country presence among competitors with over 560 local employees. Based on our large and ongoing construction program, we\u2019ve a deep and experienced team who has demonstrated the ability to deliver projects on time and on budget. We also have a long history of being able to work success successfully with local communities. This is essential for secure sing rights of way. Moving to Peru, our electric distribution company has received regulatory approval for a transmission plan that entails building several substations and transmission lines in Lima. The plan will require about $150 million of incremental investment from 2015 to 2017. Capital expenditures will earn the regulated 12% rate of return. Let's go now to slide 7. At our California utilities, both our basic operations and projects are performing well and we continue to pursue additional growth opportunities. At SoCalGas we received regulatory approval of our framework and are currently ramping up on 17 pipeline construction projects and a valve enhancement initiative, all part of our $1.5 billion PSEP program. The advanced metering program at SoCalGas is also ahead of schedule and we expect to have about 2.9 million meters installed by year end. As you are aware, SoCalGas has made a filing at the CPUC for an $800 million to $850 million Southern gas system reliability project designed to reinforce the gas transmission system and provide stronger access to supply points and gas storage. This is very important for both gas and electric system reliability. As expected, several alternate proposals have been filed, but we continue to believe our plan is superior. We expect the CPUC to rule late next year. At SDG&E, we are on track with our $1.1 billion capital plan for 2014 and received notice from the ISO that we were awarded an additional $60 million electric transmission project in our service territory. On the regulatory front, we have two important matters at the Commission and both are moving forward. We reached an amended settlement agreement with key parties on the Son's [ph] plant closure and expect CPUC approval this year. The revisions made to the settlement address all issues raised by the assigned commissioner and these revisions did not result in a material impact to Sempra's 2014 financial results. We submitted our notice of intent to file our 2016 general rate case at both utilities. The Office of Ratepayer Advocates recommended acceptance and we expect to file our official applications by year end. Let's turn to slide 8 for an update on our ongoing assessment of MLPs. We\u2019re focused on finalizing our analysis of the pros and cons of different structures. We continue to look at the traditional MLP structure as well as a variety of YieldCo like structures that are designed for growth and distributions. To simplify terminology we refer to the latter as total return vehicles or TRVs. The key issues for us include alignment with our strategies and growth initiatives, value creation for Sempra shareholders, flexibility and the potential asset mix, liquidity and size of the potential investor base and volatility and trading history of existing entities. We are on path to conclude our analysis by the end of the first quarter 2015 and hope to provide you more detail around our strategy at that time. With that, let me hand the call over to Joe to provide additional context on this topic and to walk you through the quarterly earnings. Joe? Joe Householder : Thanks, Debbie. Turning to slide 9, we discuss certain factors we\u2019re analyzing to inform our decision regarding a potential MLP or TRV. First and foremost, as Debbie just mentioned, the structure must be aligned with our strategy and enhance long-term value for Sempra shareholders. The earnings per share, dividend per share and cash flow impact for Sempra are a focus of our analysis. If an MLP or a TRV is pursued, we will work with the rating agencies to maintain our solid investment grade credit ratings. In our decision process we will follow the same discipline we used in launching the highly successful IEnova IPO. One important factor is the asset base. In our portfolio, we have assets with long-term cash flows that are currently available for formation of a vehicle. In the case of an MLP, we could include our share of REX distributions and potentially the U.S. based contracted revenues from the ECA re-gas terminal. In the case of a TRV, we could include these assets as well as certain of our wind and solar assets. We also have a variety of assets we expect to be available for future growth. In either an MLP or a TRV, Cameron Liquefaction could be the asset providing the largest cash distribution growth after all three trains are online. We could also have available LNG development projects, our Cameron pipeline, other qualifying midstream and storage assets, if market conditions improve. Additional renewables in operation or in development as well as other non-qualifying infrastructure could also be available for future growth in a TRV. Let's go to slide 10. On this slide, we break down the key attributes often used for comparison between an MLP and a TRV. As you know, the traditional MLP relies on qualifying assets while a TRV could include any asset with certainty in its long-term cash distribution profile. You are likely familiar with differences in the investor base between an MLP and a TRV. Governance and tax impacts, however, are becoming more common between the two. While we were initially focused on an MLP structure, we understand that the tax shield for a TRV is essentially equivalent to the tax shield that MLP unit holders enjoy. For a TRV, a tax loss can be carried forward to offset potential future taxable income. Analysis suggests that similar to an MLP, a TRV's tax yield can be maintained over time through growth. With regard to potential sponsor implications, asset quality and incentive distribution rights are important for valuation in either structure. As Debbie mentioned earlier, we\u2019re considering these issues and are on a path to conclude our analysis by the end of the first quarter 2015. Let's now turn to slide 11 and I will conclude with a discussion of our third quarter earnings. Sempra's third quarter consolidated earnings were $348 million or $1.39 per share. This compares to consolidated earnings of $296 million or $1.19 per share in the same quarter last year. As we normally do, we\u2019re providing individual financial results for each of our business units in the section of our presentation entitled business unit earnings. For this call, however, I'm going to focus only on the key drivers of our consolidated third quarter earnings, beginning on slide 12. Increased quarterly earnings relative to 2013 are due largely to five items. The California utilities had a combined $13 million of increased earnings due to higher CPUC based margin and improved operating performance. In 2014, the California utilities had a combined $10 million favorable impact for prior year's income tax issues, compared to a $2 million unfavorable impact in 2013. IEnova finalized the sale of a 50% equity interest in. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a $14 million after-tax gain, of which of half or $7 million is attributable to the re-measurement of our retained interest to fair value. In Mexico, we recorded $14 million of AFUDC equity earnings associated with construction of the say another ray pipeline. U.S. Gas and Power recorded a $25 million benefit related to the release of a Louisiana income tax valuation allowance. In past years we incurred losses for operations located in Louisiana. We recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax benefit at that time, due to the lack of offsetting income. With advancement of Cameron Liquefaction and prospects for future earnings in Louisiana, we were able to release the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Partially offsetting these five drivers were two items. One item was the $24 million gain recorded in 2013 from the sale of a 50% interest in two solar projects. The second item relates to $8 million in higher income tax expense for South America in 2014, primarily related to Chilean tax reform. As I mentioned on our first quarter call, Chile was considering a tax reform proposal that would increase the corporate tax rate. The President of Chile signed the tax reform bill into law on September 29th, and the $6 million impact reflects the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances. Now let's go to slide 13. To conclude, our businesses are performing well and we are on track to execute on our five-year growth plan. Cameron is in construction and new contracts on REX are also in place. IEnova's construction on major projects is progressing on time and year-to-date earnings for Sempra Mexico operations are higher than last year, despite $16 million of higher non-controlling interest in 2014. In South America, earnings reflect a couple of items worth mentioning. Year-to-date earnings primarily for Chile continue to be impacted by a weaker peso to dollar exchange rate. As we have discussed previously, tariffs in our South American utilities are generally adjusted for foreign currency changes over time. Chilean tax reform also impacted earnings this quarter. Despite these considerations, our South American utilities remain fundamentally sound and show continued growth in customers and sales. Finally, our California utilities have their major capital programs in place and earnings continue to reflect a higher CPUC base margin and improved operating results. As Debbie noted earlier, based on third quarter earnings and our year-to-date financial performance, we expect to be near the upper end of our 2014 earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.55 per share. With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you may have. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We'll go first to Greg Gordon with Evercore. Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore: I've got one question on the quarter and one question on some of the drivers. I guess I'll start with the quarter. As I look at the summary on page 13, it looks like the \u2013 I'm sorry, not the summary on page 13, the summary on page 12 with all the items impacting the quarter. The income tax swing, the ESJ wind gain and the release of the allowance, I understand that you had \u2013 there are offsetting things that happened in the prior year like the gain you had on Copper Mountain, but as we look forward into 2015 and we look at your \u2013 the guidance range you gave for us for 2015, is that already \u2013 should we assume they contemplate such gains or losses in there? Debbie Reed : Greg, let me just say for 2015 we're going to update our guidance as we always do in February. What I would just say is that when we do our guidance we contemplate what we know at that point in time. So to the extent when we gave you the guidance back at the analyst meeting in March, we knew things were going to occur in 2015. We would have put those in our guidance at that time. But we will update that guidance because there's been things that have happened since that time and we'll update that guidance in February as we always do. Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore: Okay. So that switches to my next question. As I look at page 4 of your \u2013 the guidance section from the Analyst Day, you did a pretty good job outlining what was in your aspiration and what wasn't and based on the update you've given us today, looks like on the California utilities you've got a small transmission project that wasn't contemplated. You've got a fairly large potential gas infrastructure project that wasn't contemplated. You've got the SFE pipelines in Latin America and Peru transmission that wasn't contemplated. And then refresh my memory. I just want to be clear, the 1.8 Bcf of day of REX backhaul was not \u2013 was also not contemplated in that guidance. Is that correct? Debbie Reed : Yes. Let me just go through to summarize those so that everyone kind of hears the same thing. When we look at what we showed you back in March and we look at some of the things that were in the additional opportunities that have already been secured that we have the 1.6 Bcf from REX for the east to west flows and that's incremental to what we had in our plan of the 0.2 B's. We also have the second piece of REX which is the Clarington West Flow [ph] that we haven't announced contracts on yet. And as I mentioned, that should be coming out in the next couple of months. Renewables, we have the 92-megawatt contract with Edison for CMS-4. And on electric transmission, this quarter we got $60 million of incremental investment. We also have some other projects that were incremental to our plan at SDG&E and then we also had the $150 million of electric transmission in Peru that I mentioned on the call. So those are things that where we basically have either been assigned them by the ISO or by the regulators in Peru or we have contracts with REX or with renewables. Then we have a lot of bids for additional development and we're bidding two CFE pipelines in Mexico, two CFE pipelines in the U.S., some additional renewables where we are offers out and we mentioned trains four and five in Cameron. Those are things we're actively working on as well. Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore: You've also got this $800 million to $850 million gas infrastructure proposal where you'll find out late next year if that's approved, right? Debbie Reed : Yes. And part of that was in the later years of our plan, because that \u2013 we would expect to get the decision towards the end of next year but construction doesn't ramp up on that until some of the mid to later years of the plan. Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore: And when would you roll out explicit 2016 earnings guidance range? Debbie Reed : We'll roll those out 2016; we usually do at the analyst conference. And so we do 2015 on the call in February, generally, and then we give you both of those and then our long-term outlook at the analyst conference. And that would be \u2013 the one thing I want to be sure to mention is that when I went through all of these growth opportunities that \u2013 and using the Southern reliability system as an example, not all of these projects are going to affect 2015 earnings. Some of the projects, like REX comes in part of it in 2015, some of the additional contracts would not come into place until 2016, when we look at the Peruvian transmission it's 2015 to 2017 and so a lot of these things are going to not affect just the 2015. The other thing that I want to mention is that with the additional bids that we have under development, we are going to also be incurring development costs during 2015. And we are planning on getting trains four and five with the permits filed and same thing for Port Arthur and for projects like that, plus all these CFE bids that we expect there to be development costs. So all of that kind of information will be updated when we give you our guidance in February. Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore: I do have one more question. So there's been a lot of oil price volatility over the last couple months and the people's \u2013 it seems that investor's expectations for the probability of incremental LNG export kind of ebbs and flows with the oil price a as it balances between where it is today and the prices we saw earlier in the year. Is there a \u2013 can you give us some sense of whether the appetite from your counter counterparties who are discussing with you the potential for these incremental trains, at what oil price they're no longer interested in ex ordering gas from the U.S.? Debbie Reed : Let me just mention one thing and that is that all of the joint venture parties agree for us to move forward with some of the initial work and preparation of our FERC filing for trains four and five. So I mean, that in itself is a good indication. But Mark has done a lot of work in this area and we expected that there would be questions on oil prices, so I'm going to turn it to Mark to kind of say why we think our facilities are very well positioned in terms of the global markets. Mark Snell : Greg, I think you know that this LNG business is a long-term business and what we're seeing from our partners is an interest in securing long-term supply of LNG from the United States with all the stability and the continuity that that can provide. And we really haven't seen that interest abate even as we've seen oil prices fall in the last few days here. If you look at the underlying numbers and I'm not going to get into all the details now, but generally speaking we still have \u2013 the U.S. gas and U.S. LNG especially from the Gulf has a pretty good cost advantage over just about everything else that there is in the world today. And that continues down to gas or oil prices as they drop even down to the $70 range. One thing I think it's worth noting is a lot of these foreign contracts, oil linked contracts for LNG have S-curves in them with sets a floor and a ceiling on prices as oil prices fluctuate. And so it's not a point where even if oil were to drop to levels that we haven't seen in 15 or 20 years, LNG wouldn't necessarily on a worldwide basis fall to those levels, except other than on the spot market. There's some built in price levels there. And I think we're competitive with those, given where price is. And I think the other thing that's really, really important and that these folks focus on is diversity of supply. And that includes geographic diversity. Obviously the United States being a real favorite these days of trying to get some supply out of the U.S., also diversity of facilities and geographic locations within the U.S. So I think at the end of the day we feel very confident that our partners are interesting \u2013 interested in moving forward on trains four and five. We see other outside interest for Port Arthur. We are having discussions on, on maybe conversions there. So we're kind of looking at all of these opportunities and we think we can be online with some of these as early as 2020. And we're going to kind of prioritize which ones that we think need to come online first and we'll just kind of move through the list. But we're pretty excited about what's the level of interest and the opportunity for us to continue to grow our LNG business. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : Couple questions, first on the Cameron four and five filing at FERC next year, would you anticipate you would have contracts in place by the time that you file at FERC? Debbie Reed : I'm going to have Mark go ahead and go through that and kind of go through the schedule a bit with you as to what we're envisioning. Mark Snell : It's a good question. I don't know that we would have firm contracts in place. Usually, the contracts aren't firm until we take FID, the firm investment decision, and we wouldn't expect to do that until sometime after we get the permit, 16 or 17. We're working with our partners and we obviously have customers that we have put in the queue that are looking at this opportunity, but it's sort of a chicken and egg thing. They want to make sure that we're going to do it and we have the facility and getting the permits will cement that in their minds that this facility is moving forward and I think they'd be much more comfortable than to commit to that supply. So as we look at this, I think we would expect sometime after that we would probably firm up contracts. That doesn't mean we won't have MOUs and other kinds of indications of interest and I think that's very likely that we will. A firm contract really doesn't exist until you take FID. Debbie Reed : I would say it would be very parallel to what we did on trains one through three where we had with partners, we had commitments that if the facility was built at a certain pricing point that they would move forward with it. But that's very different than getting to FID, where the partners now have to you put their money on the table and all. So I think it would be constructed very much the same in terms of contracts. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay. Maybe my terminology might have been too specific there. I guess it seems that there's a little bit more of an interest in approving projects that have more likelihood of getting done, which having some kind of initial commitment helps along that way. So do you expect by the time you file there would be some kind of initial commitment for the LNG? Mark Snell : Yes, I think that we'll have initial interest. And also too, I just want to remind you that now that FERC or that DOE has changed the way that they look at this and let FERC is taking the lead, you're not really going to move forward with a lot of this activity because it is, as Debbie mentioned, there's fairly expensive development costs in moving this through the permitting process. And so we're not going to do that without some indication of interest and that we're going to be able to move this to completion. So I think the change in the process that was recently announced a few months ago is also leading to people being much more secure about what's going on as they move forward. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay. Second question, this might be a little silly, but just do you guys have something against the term YieldCo or what's the thought or is there a message underneath kind of recalling it a TRV instead of YieldCo? Debbie Reed : I'm going to ask Joe to answer that, because he and his team came up with that term as we were looking at it. I think it is pretty descriptive and kind of what the option we're looking at, but Joe? Joe Householder : Look, I think, Steve, really it's us thinking pout thinking about what this is and I think the YieldCo term is a little bit funny, you think a YieldCo is something that's at a high yield. What we really see is this is going to be very highly valued because of growth and yield and so we just didn't really like the term and didn't really fit us and it didn't fit our strategy and we think that it's really a total return vehicle and that's why we are talking about that. One of the problems we had internally is we're looking at a couple different types. Everything we're looking at is MLP like in structure but it might be the tax is a little bit different depending on what we do so we needed a term to talk about these things that weren't traditional MLPs and this is what we came onto. Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay. One last question with respect to just the decision on MLP YieldCo. The other companies that are moved forward with MLPs, YieldCos, the stocks generally have done well into it. Once they've actually executed there hasn't been a lot of follow-through. Do you have any kind of thoughts they the way you're looking at it, where you might either do it differently or communicate differently to benefit to Sempra holders if you go forward? Debbie Reed : I think the key is that whatever we do has to bring greater value to Sempra shareholders in our minds and that we'll be able to articulate why we think that that would occur. I would say the one thing that we feel very good about is if we do something, if we don't do something, whatever we do, we have a really great set of assets. I think how a company fundamentally has long-term value is the growth, the potential on assets that they have, the ability to grow their business, the ability to really have steady cash flows that are growing and I think we're in good position regardless of the structure that we have to do that. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. And I would just turn it to Joe to talk about a little bit of what we're looking at on the shareholder value side and the work that's under way. Joe Householder : Steve, this is part of the reason we put a lot of content into this call because later once we make a decision, we'll be filing some stuff and then we won't with able to talk about it. So we wanted to be able to explain how we're thinking about this, that we really are focused on the long-term value for Sempra and we wanted you to all understand what the things we're looking at. And so we've described on page 9 and page 10 how we're thinking about it, the kind of assets we're looking at, how we expect these things to work. And I don't want to talk about really the other company's stock values and what's happened to them but we believe that the strength of our underlying business and the execution that we have on our growth plan is going to be reflected in how our shares perform and if we choose to create one of these vehicles then as it's been with other large high quality sponsors, they're kind of small at the outset but I think that's one of the things you see is these things are pretty small for some of these large players. And so I don't think it's moving the stock much around. And it might do the same with us, it's hard to tell. Once those IDRs become significant and that value is very transparent, I think you'll see that in our stock very clearly. Debbie Reed : I would just add to that and highlight IEnova and kind of what was done there and we were the first energy company to trade on the exchange and we took a lot of time to determine what was the best approach, what was the best timing, is this something that's going to bring value to the Sempra shareholders. Is it going to give more transparency to the value of those underlying assets. And we would make the same kind of considerations as we decide whether we're going to do a vehicle and if so, what type of vehicle we would do. I think you'll l see that same kind of disciplined behavior for us as we analyze this. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Chris Turnure \u2013 JPMorgan: Could you give us a little bit more color on. You certainly talked about contracting conditions in general for LNG. You mentioned that the kind of interest remains strong. So did IEnova when they talked about it. Could you mention kind of if anything has changed for that project specifically over the past couple months? Debbie Reed : I would say that, Chris, there's nothing really that's changed. We've been doing the gas study and we're completing some of the work on the gas study to look at gas availability. The issue there that's been there and we've always talked about it is that we have contracts through 2028 as an import facility. So the economics of taking a facility that, I don't know, it's about $150 million or so cash flow from that facility, and making it into an export facility, we need to look at what the benefits of that would be and that there has to be a compelling story for that. And so looking at gas, looking at the sizing of the facility, looking at the customers, looking at the existing customers, are all the things that we've always talked about with that facility and they're still present for us. We're working it and we're definitely working trains four and five and definitely working Port Arthur. We're working all three of them. Chris Turnure \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. And then could you give us a little bit more color if you could on timing with ECA. I know it's hard to do at this point but you've definitely been more specific with four and five, I think, and even Port Arthur at this point than you've been down there. Debbie Reed : Well I mentioned in my talking points that what we were looking at is having all the gas analysis done and then really looking at what kind of a facility could be there and having some conversations with our customers in the first half of next year. That's the kind of timing for that. There is a regulatory process. I guess the rules just came out in Mexico with some of the details on what is required in order to get regulatory approval. But it's a different process than in the U.S. So I mean, I think that within the first half of the year, just as with the other projects, we should have a good sense as to what we think about sizing, what we think about timing, and what we think about the economics of the project. Chris Turnure \u2013 JPMorgan: And then my follow-up question is just on year-to-date earnings and the third quarter specifically. There's kind of an unusually large number of one-time mostly tax related items. Do you have a sense of what a normalized number would be if you moved all of that stuff? Debbie Reed : I'm going to have Joe or Trevor go through that. And I would remind you that if you kind of look year to year, last year we had a gain on CMS-2 that came in the quarter and it was almost the same size as this LA tax valuation. So if you kind of take those things out, you still see a growth of double-digit growth rate year-over-year which I think is along a path that we're intending to head. Joe Householder : I think just what she said. You can pick and choose things that tend to be one-time items if you want to call them that. I would say in our renewable business we tend to have gains on sales fairly often. Last year we had $24 million in the third quarter, this year we had $13 million in the third quarter. This year we had the Chilean tax reform hit us for 6 and we had $8 million of repatriation tax. Where last year this quarter we didn't have any because it all got booked in the first quarter. So if you try to pull some of those out and you pull out the valuation allowance which was in our plan, but if you pulled that out and say that's the onetime item we have nearly 19% growth over last year and if you take out the tax items at the utilities, we have those all the time, they happen all the time, but if you take those out they're 14% earnings growth. We have very solid growth in this quarter and year-to-date the numbers are very similar. You can pick and choose. But we have very, very solid growth. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Weinstein with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: It's actually Julien. I have a quick detail here on Mesquite. Do you have a sales price that you could disclose? Debbie Reed : All we're saying that is our book value's about 300 and we sold it for above book. And we'll remind you all that the gain on that sale is not part of the guidance, so -- Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Turning to Mexico, if you will, how much does the U.S./Mexican project drive a decision between MLP versus whatever else you you've contemplated? Call it YieldCo, total return vehicle, etcetera. Debbie Reed : I don't think that that would drive anything in terms of our decision making. We're looking at kind of long-term and so it would be a nice factor for if you were looking at either of those. It would be a nice factor, but it's not a driver. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: So you feel like you have sufficient critical mass to get the MLP off the ground, irrespective of near term project awards, right, just to be clear? Debbie Reed : We're not going to comment on that. As I mentioned, we're doing the assessment of that and we're looking at those assets. We're looking at where our growth is and we're doing that, all of that work, and I'm just not going to comment on specific assets. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: And then going back to the notion of a total return vehicle, you talk about other infrastructure assets. Broadly speaking, what else would be contemplated within a TRV, if you will? It's midstream, clearly, it's renewables, clearly. What else within the context of your current portfolio or within the context of your organic growth plans would be included potentially? Debbie Reed : I would refer you back to Joe's comments, but Joe, do you want to kind of articulate that again, some of the comments. Joe Householder : Sure. Really what we looked at is the strategy for Sempra and it's been consistent for many, many, many years now, long-term contracted infrastructure and we've built and contracted many different kind of assets. And while we're exiting merchant generation now, we certainly had assets like that that could have been put in there. We might look at petrochemical kind of assets, other things that are natural gas related kind of assets. There could be things that just don't fit in the qualifying asset characterization. And so we could \u2013 I mentioned before, while we're not currently contemplating it, we could put some of these non-U.S. assets in there. We certainly probably won't do that with Mexico but there's others assets that we could put in. It's just a broader group that fits nicely with our strategy. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: And a last little detail here, congrats on Mesquite, first. But secondly, TDM in Mexico, is there a thought process or time line around re-contracting that asset? Debbie Reed : We have a goal to do something with TDM on a long-term basis. And as I mentioned in my comments, with the energy reform going forward that generation will be kind of one of the next areas that they will be looking at. And we think with TDM interconnected to Mexico it could be one of the best and most economic assets to meet some of those needs. So that's our plan is to work that with the sale into Mexico. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Under long term offtake presumably? Debbie Reed : A sale of the asset or sale or long-term offtake, PPA agreement, whatever structure seems to work best. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Just wanted to follow up and make sure I understand about the offtake agreements on Cameron trains four and five. So you've indicated that you expect to start the FERC filing process the first half of next year and I believe you said that you would expect to have some offtake agreements in hand before you go to FERC. So is the implication that you expect to be able to announce some form of offtake agreements in the first half of next year? Debbie Reed : Yes, let me have Mark go through that again to be sure that it's very clear what we're talking about. And also kind of the schedule at FERC, because you make a pre-filing and then you make the complete FERC filing. And so let's kind of walk you through what we're thinking. Mark Snell : Yeah, I think where we're going to be is we will start the filing process at FERC with our application. And we would not expect at that moment in the first half of or the first quarter of 2015 to have agreements in hand. As I said before, actually firm agreements would not be done until we actually reached FID, which is a year or so down the road. But we might have indications of interest and I think you can \u2013 by the very nature of this project, the fact that Mitsubishi and GDF are our partners and they have agreed to move these process forward, they obviously have an interest in that capacity. So I think just by the nature of the players involved, you can see that there's interest in moving the project forward. But no one's has made a commitment yet to sign on and pay for the \u2013 to pay for these facilities to be built in a firm way. But we're going to move forward with the permitting process. We're going to get that started. We've authorized monies to be spent on development and we think the project looks very favorable compared to others that could be considered. So we're very optimistic that this project will move forward. It's certainly one of the lowest cost projects that you could possibly do in the region because it's an add-on to an existing project. Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : So I think I understand. It's a point at which you get \u2013 when you get to the point where you'd be making the full FERC filing, at that point if you don't have some kind of nonbinding let's call it offtake agreements, you'd put the brakes on the project at that point? Mark Snell : Yes, there's certainly a point if we thought that the interest in the facility was waning or that we couldn't reach a full FID decision, obviously we'd stop spending money on it. We're not in that position right now. We feel like it's got a lot of interest and we're willing to spend some development dollars on furthering that and bringing that \u2013 bringing the project to fruition. This is very, very similar to what we did on Cameron's one through three. It's really the same process. Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : You announced the offtake agreements for trains one through three before the FID. So I guess I'm just trying to understand if we should expect a similar announcement of those agreements. Mark Snell : Yes, before FID you'll have agreements that require FID as a condition precedent for those agreements going forward. But that's a very typical way that this would be done. Debbie Reed : If you look back at Cameron one through three, what we had is kind of an MOU with the parties on the joint venture agreement and then the tolling agreement in that case. And then we went forward with some of the more costly developments to allow the FERC filing after we had that to make the full filing at FERC that is necessary for your permitting. It's the same type of process that we would be looking at here, whether it's offtake agreements for LNG or it's a tolling arrangement, we would look at having some type of MOU in place with interested parties before we started spending a lot of money. Mark Snell : The only thing here is that we're a little further ahead because things like the tolling arrangements and all those agreements have already really been drafted once. They just need to be amended for the additional capacity. Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : And then shifting gears to the MLP versus TRV debate. As you walk through the criteria, it really sounded to me like the TRV was the superior option on most of the criteria that you walked us through and largely because of the flexibility it provides. Is it fair to say that's the way you're leaning? Debbie Reed : We're not leaning anywhere. I just made real clear because I could give you some reasons why the MLP would be interesting too. So what we're trying to do is really look at this without getting hooked on anything and really do kind of the step away, look at this from a Sempra shareholder perspective as what is the best decision and to take our time to do that and to have that completed by the end of the first quarter. So there's no leaning one way or the other. We're looking \u2013 all options are open for us right now and we're watching how things trade. We're watching how our growth goes and what kinds of assets that we think would be available for each vehicle if we decided to do a vehicle. All of that work is under way and we'll have that concluded by the first quarter. Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : At the Analyst Day in the Spring I believe you said that your plan was to do an MLP and it was just kind of a matter of timing and that was before you start talking about the TRV option. Should we still be thinking of this decision in the first quarter as just which vehicle you're going to do or what's the likelihood that you decide to do nothing? Debbie Reed : I'm not going to comment because we haven't decided. Like I said, there's really options on the table, all of those options are open right now and I don't ever recall saying that we were committed to doing one thing. We had looked at it. There had been a lot of interest in us doing it. We saw that we had assets that we thought would be very good assets for that type of structure and we still feel we have really good assets for either of these kinds of structures. So we'll make those decisions and inform you when we made the decisions after the first quarter. Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : And didn't mean to put words in your mouth, just one final follow-up to that. You kind of alluded to a pipeline of renewables projects that could contribute to growth if you go the TRV route. Could you just talk to us a little about what's in your renewables pipeline right now and if the pipeline, what is included in your current long-term guidance? Debbie Reed : Yes. If you look at our renewables business, the areas where we still have a lot of opportunities for development are with our Copper Mountain facility and we can keep adding there. We also have rose month which we have actually are participating in some RFPs to develop that site right now. There are opportunities to expand some of the wind sites that we're in and we're looking at some of the additional phases on those wind sites. And so \u2013 and then we're always out in the market, looking at other opportunities for exciting new renewables. So we have projects that we keep working on. I think where we actually have some land positions we're in really great position to develop renewable projects in those sites. Mark Snell : The only one you didn't mention was Mesquite, create a large facility at Mesquite that we could expand. Operator : We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Just two quick ones, on REX, did you note the potential for some additional opportunities outside of the Clarington west part of it? I think you noted some laterals there. Debbie Reed : What I talked about is the Prairie State Pipeline that Telegraph [ph] and AGL have proposed that links in to REX. And if they're doing a nonbinding open season on that pipeline, that ties into REX and takes gas into kind of the hub of Chicago. And obviously if they get a lot of interest on that pipeline they're going to need upstream supply. And so we have \u2013 in the 2.4 Bcf of potential expansions for REX, there's two pieces. There's the piece of about 700 to 800 a day that's from additional compression and then the remainder of it would come from looping the line. And so to the degree that there's more downstream market for the gas, then we think that that gives us additional upstream opportunities on REX. Rajeev Lalwani \u2013 Morgan Stanley : And then just switching over to Cameron four and five, as it relates to the FERC process, what drives the time line for approval and what's the potential for accelerating it, given that you've got Cameron one through three already approved? Mark Snell : So if your question is on the regulatory side, how does the process work, I think the answer to that is that it \u2013 the FERC process will drive it and the DOE export process kind of will play off of the FERC process. Under this new regime, the DOE will consider only projects that have gone through a certain amount of the FERC process. One of the things that we talked about was that we may be able to accelerate the FERC process because we have trains one through three. We may be able to do what they call an environmental assessment as opposed to a full environmental impact report. And that could shorten the process by several months, really. And it would be a little bit cheaper, too. We don't know that we're going to be able to do that. We're looking at it. We're talking with our consultants on it. But that is one way that we could shorten the process a little bit. Does that answer your question? Rajeev Lalwani \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  It does, Mark. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Faisal Khan with Citigroup. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup: Just going back to this MLP versus YieldCo. Is there any reason why you don't do both? The reason why I'm asking, is you don't know if you look down over the next four, five years if you're going to grow your midstream and natural gas and refined product exports, whatever you guys want to do, if you want to grow that asset base that's where the MLP works, if you're going to grow some of the stuff outside the U.S. and the renewable stuff then certainly YieldCo works. I'm just trying to figure out, it seems like we're talking about one versus the other but I'm just trying to understand if you couldn't do both. Joe Householder : We think that either can work. I don't see us, and we said this for several years, I don't see us doing a separate YieldCo for our renewable business. Our renewable business is a nice business but it's not a big part of the business and I think that the YieldCo would be too small. It just wouldn't be sufficient of a vehicle and so I don't see us going down that path. But I think that the TRV vehicle or the MLP can work for us and that's why we're looking at both of them very hard. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup: Just on REX and Clarington West, I just want to make sure that was I thought contemplated to be a 2.4 Bcf a day expansion, I noticed in your slides it says TBD. Is that because it could be bigger or could be smaller? Debbie Reed : It's largely because there's two pieces of it and we did the nonbinding open season and as I mentioned that we're in the final negotiations with the shippers that participated in that nonbinding open season. We'll announce that later. But if there's additional market pull in Chicago, that that may get all the way to the 2.4 and there's options, always options to expand beyond the 2.4 if you get to that. So how close we get to the 2.4, I think will be more visible to us over the next year. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup: And then just on the LNG strategy, you said that you guys are going to get reimbursed for the development cost for one and three. Did I hear that right on the call? Is that \u2013 how does that cash come back to you? Debbie Reed : We did. When we went through the FID and through the lets call effective date which is when all the asset goes in and the financing is arranged and everything, then we did get reimbursed from our partners for our share of \u2013 or their share of the development cost. And then we also got their first contributions to their equity going in to match our equity which was our basically billion dollar asset that we put into the JV. So now we're starting \u2013 that's our equity contribution. They'll continue to make equity contributions until they get up to the levels to match our equity value. And then we\u2019ve the sharing arrangement for all of the costs as we go forward. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup:  And then for the marketing of volume for trains four and five, how competitive is the environment today, the contracting environment? There's still other facilities out there, some of them Brownfield, some of them greenfield, that are still being developed and just want to understand sort of what you guys commercial inertia is right now in terms of finding customers? Debbie Reed : I would say that the one thing that we found is that there is a lot of parties in the market. There have not been very many parties that have gotten through the process and into construction. And so the fact that you have a facility that is already being built, that can be expanded or that you've demonstrated your ability to get through all of those processes and get a facility in place, I think provides us a strong competitive advantage in the marketplace. There are a lot of players out trying to market that buyers really want certainty, because if they are contracting for long-term supplies on a certain date to be delivered, then they're counting on that gas to get there, that LNG to get there and they're not delighted with some of the projects that may never get done. So I think we're in a good position. I think, yes there is a lot of people out there marketing but I think we're in a very good position. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup: And then just in terms of what happens if one of your JV partners wanted to opt out of the expansions at four and five? Mark Snell : Sure. There is provisions within our agreement that would allow the other partners to take over their position if we so choose to. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup: Okay. On a pro rata basis or just whoever wants is or \u2013 ? Mark Snell : Yes, it's effectively pro rata. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup: Understood. And then last question from me, just with the stronger U.S. dollar, just trying to figure out if there's any sort of longer term impacts to your earnings from overseas? Debbie Reed : Joe, do you want to discuss that? We have been seeing FX effects and that is something that we commented on and it's clearly impacted our South American businesses this year. What I would say is that if you look at those businesses, the growth and some of \u2013 we're able to offset some of the impact of FX by the growth in those businesses. But it has been an impact. Joe Householder : We're really pleased with the continued growth we have in the customers and the energy sales in both countries, as Debbie just mentioned, and the utilities are performing as we expected them to and continue to grow. But this quarter the currency movement wasn't very significant but for the year in Chile a lot of that currency movement is offset the growth but not in Peru. In Peru the currency is more stable and we have really solid growth there. So overall between Chile, Peru and Mexico it hasn't been very material this year. Operator : We'll go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar Financial. Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Financial : Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss this. You mentioned the two Texas pipelines. Had you talked about the size of those and what that would be volumetric, I would say? Debbie Reed : Yes actually, what I would refer you to, because it's a little bit confusing with all these pipelines that are being bid, if you go to slide 22 and 23 in your package it lists all of those pipelines. And the two in Texas, three and four on page 22 and it shows that both the mileage and the CapEx that was estimated by CFE, that's not our CapEx number, that's the CFE estimate of CapEx so that will help you look at all of those pipelines. And then the ones listed below, five through 17 are the ones that they've announced that they're going to be bidding in the near term. And you can see all of those are supposed to go in service by 2018, so they will need to bid them in the near term. Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Financial : On those CapEx numbers actually, with the estimates that are coming out from the government, are those coming I guess in practice on the ground as these first round of pipes are being constructed, how accurate are those figures? Debbie Reed : Yes, I think it's not in our competitive interest to comment on their pricing estimates. So I would just say sometimes they're good, sometimes they're not so on track. And I'm not going to say anything more about it. Debbie Reed : Well being that there are no further questions, thanks again for joining us today on Sempra's third quarter 2014 earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact our great IR team and have a wonderful day. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Richard A. Vaccari: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Financial and Operational Results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. We also have the heads of our 2 California utilities, Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive of Southern California Gas; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2015, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 3 and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed: Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who are joining us. 2014 lays a strong foundation for our future growth. We have solid financial performance, achieved double-digit annual EPS growth and posted earnings exceeding our guidance. We also achieved important milestones on development projects and delivered strong operating results across all of our businesses. With the great progress made over the year, we are on track to be at the upper end of our expected 9% to 11% earnings per share growth rate for 2014 to 2019. As a reminder, we have our upcoming Analyst Conference on March 26, and we hope to see all of you in New York. At that time, we will update our 5-year earnings projections and discuss our plans to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. For today's call, I am going to focus on a summary of our 2014 financial results and recent operational accomplishments that will help us to achieve our long-term growth plan. I will then hand the call over to Joe to explain the fourth quarter earnings, our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range and our 2015 dividend increase. Please turn to Slide 4. This morning, we reported 2014 earnings of $4.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2014 earnings were $4.71 per share, representing 13% annual growth over 2013. We had strong operating performance across the company that contributed to this result. Several fourth quarter factors also drove earnings above our expectation from the last call where we stated that we expected to be near the upper end of our 2014 guidance range. The major factor was tax reform in Peru that was implemented on December 31. Peru lowered its corporate income tax rate, which reduced our deferred income tax liability and resulted in an $18 million benefit recorded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the CPUC approved our energy efficiency awards for both utilities earlier than we had anticipated. Looking to 2015, we expect Sempra's adjusted earnings to be within the range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share, excluding 2 items Joe will discuss later. We also received Sempra Board approval to increase our annualized dividend to $2.80 per share, a 6% increase. If you look back over the last few years, our dividend has increased nearly 80% since 2010, and we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for an overview of key accomplishments at SoCalGas and SDG&E. Our California utilities are spending capital consistent with approved programs. The utilities have also received important regulatory decisions in 2014 that established the framework to guide investments in programs like the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, or PSEP. In November, the CPUC approved the SONGS multiparty settlement agreement that resolves the cost recovery issues on the plant closure. Also, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their 2016 General Rate Case applications with a proposed decision expected by the end of this year. In December, the CPUC approved a 1 year extension of the utilities cost of capital rates. The extension keeps the authorized returns on equity of 10.1% for SoCalGas and 10.3% for SDG&E intact through 2016. It also keeps in place an automatic adjustment mechanism should interest rates move beyond a predetermined band. Operationally, SoCalGas installed nearly 1.8 million advanced meters last year and is ahead of schedule on their program to install nearly 6 million advanced meters by the end of 2017. Both utilities are ahead of schedule in implementing their pipeline safety enhancement plans as well, having already tested or replaced over 30 miles of pipeline last year. Now let's move to U.S. Gas & Power on Slide 6. Key milestones reached last year on the Cameron Liquefaction project include reaching the final investment decision, or FID; forming the joint venture; and getting the project fully into construction. With permits, financing and the lump sum turnkey contract in place, we remain on track to complete all 3 trains in 2018. In December, the JV also filed with the Department of Energy for FTA authorization to export an additional 2.95 million tons of LNG per annum on trains 1 through 3. We expect to file for the non-FTA export permit this quarter. These higher volumes match the maximum design capacity of the plant approved by FERC, and permits would allow us to export additional LNG during periods when production levels exceed the 12 million tons per annum already approved. However, just to be clear, while this can provide upside, we do not expect the plant to produce at the maximum capacity on a routine basis and additional production is unlikely during startup and the first few years of operation. If higher volumes can be produced that Cameron's customers use for export, we could see earnings upside in the future of approximately $30 million for each 1 million tons produced. Work on our 3 major LNG development projects also continues to move forward. This week, the JV partner submitted the FERC prefiling and DOE FTA export application for Cameron trains 4 and 5. The filing would add a combined LNG capacity of approximately 9 million to 10 million tons per annum. We expect to submit the full FERC filing later this year, which will initiate the detailed environmental review process that should take approximately 12 to 18 months to complete. At Port Arthur and ECA, design, regulatory and commercial activities are ongoing. For Port Arthur, we are working to prepare our FERC prefiling. For ECA, we announced the signing of an MOU with PEMEX last week. The agreement signifies our intention to cooperate on the development of the export project and explore the possibility for PEMEX to participate as a customer, supplier and/or investor. For all 3 development projects, we have been meeting with a large number of potential customers and continue to see demand for LNG supplies in the 2020 to 2023 timeframe. We have also been on the road, speaking with many of you, about our competitive advantages in providing low-cost reliable LNG to the market. Our U.S. and Mexican LNG projects are very compelling, even in today's lower oil price environment. And Sempra is one of the few developers who have successfully contracted, permitted and financed a liquefaction facility in North America. We plan to provide an in-depth discussion on our development projects at our March Analyst Conference, and we'll have the President of our LNG business, Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, there to answer your questions. Let's now go to Slide 7. For our Natural Gas segment, converting REX into a bidirectional pipeline was a positive long-term development last year. As you know, 1.8 Bcf per day of east-to-west capacity on REX is now under long-term contract. 1/3 of this capacity is in service, and the remaining capacity should be online mid-2015. In addition, the REX joint venture has made progress on finalizing precedent agreements with interested shippers for expansion of east to west capacity. The expansion would likely occur through additional compression and would be subject to regulatory approval. We are expecting any day to receive our FERC approval of the 1.2 Bcf per day of east-to-west capacity that is already contracted. Once that approval is received, we hope to provide additional details on the expansion project. Shifting to our renewables business. In the fourth quarter, we added our 75-megawatt Broken Bow 2 Wind Project to a joint venture with ConEd. With this transaction, we have successfully partnered with ConEd on over 700 megawatts of renewable power projects, including 7 different solar plants and the Broken Bow 2 Wind Farm. Please turn to Slide 8. In Mexico, IEnova has progressed on construction and is now generating earnings on sections of both the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines placed in service in 2014. Together, these 2 pipelines will provide nearly 3 Bcf per day of import capacity to Mexico. IEnova was also awarded the first natural gas pipeline tendered by CFE as part of Mexico's 5-year national infrastructure plan. The associated CapEx is $300 million and the pipeline should be in service in the first half of 2017 under a 25-year, dollar-denominated take-or-pay contract. Since our last call, the CFE has put out tenders for an additional 4 pipelines in Mexico, representing an estimated $1.8 billion in investment. One of the bids is due next month and the other 3 bids are due in May. For your reference, we provide updated information on CFE bids in the appendix to this presentation. With that, let's move to a discussion of the quarterly earnings in more detail. Before I hand the call over to Joe, however, I want to comment on the status of our total return vehicle, or TRV, analysis. We have indicated that we expect to complete our analysis on a preferred TRV structure by the end of first quarter. We are continuing several different work streams in this respect. As you know, nearly all of our midstream and renewable assets are owned in partnerships and there are numerous accounting and legal aspects we must deal with for those assets. We will provide you with more information on our TRV preferred structure at the analyst conference. Joe? Joseph A. Householder: Thanks, Debbie. Turning to Slide 9, our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results were very strong. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $297 million or $1.18 per share. We recorded an additional $12 million after-tax loss in the fourth quarter for the early closure of SONGS, making the total SONGS-related loss in 2014 equal to $21 million. Excluding this loss, fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $309 million or $1.23 per share. Full year 2014 earnings totaled $1,161,000,000 or $4.63 per share. This compares to 2013 earnings of $1,001,000,000 or $4.01 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2014 earnings per share were $4.71. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings per share grew 13%. Similar to last quarter's call, we provide individual financial results for each of our businesses in the section of our presentation entitled Business Unit Earnings. Today, I'm going to focus on the key drivers of our consolidated fourth quarter earnings, beginning on Slide 10. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings increased over the same period last year, due in part to $33 million of benefits in 2014, coming largely from 3 items. First, in December, the Peruvian Congress approved gradually lowering the corporate income tax rate from 30% in 2014 to 26% in 2019, and that was signed by the President on December 31. We recorded an $18 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter as a result of the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities. Second, U.S. Gas & Power recorded an $8 million after-tax gain from the sale of a 50% equity interest in the Broken Bow 2 Wind Project. Third, SDG&E had $7 million of increased earnings from higher CPUC-based margin and FERC regulatory operations. Partially offsetting these items were $7 million of net benefits in 2013. SoCalGas had $20 million of lower income tax expense in 2013, primarily related to resolution of prior year's income tax items and higher flow-through deductions recorded in that year. Netted against this amount is $13 million of deferred income tax expense for Sempra Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2013 that related to Mexican tax reform. With regard to foreign currency-related effects, we did see a $16 million reduction in South American earnings over the course of 2014 due to the depreciation of local currencies against the dollar. However, this impact was almost entirely offset by foreign currency-related effects and inflation in Mexico, where depreciation of the local currency decreased our deferred tax-related balances and increased our earnings. Now please go to Slide 11. Turning to our guidance for 2015, we are setting our adjusted earnings guidance range at $4.60 per share to $5 per share. This range reflects a number of factors, including higher utility earnings, new revenue on the REX pipeline, a year end forecast for South American currencies and the fall of natural gas futures prices that may reduce our gas storage and marketing revenues. Our adjusted guidance range excludes 2 items. First, as we indicated last quarter, we are not including the expected gain on the sale of the second block of our Mesquite Power Plant. The estimated earnings impact for this sale ranges from $0.12 per diluted share to $0.15 per diluted share. Second, we expect to incur some development costs related to our 3 LNG projects, Cameron trains 4 and 5, ECA and Port Arthur. Advancing development projects to the full FERC filing could cost up to $25 million per project. However, at this point, we do not know the timing or the amount we will spend, the total cost we will share with our partners or the breakdown between the amount we may capitalize and the amount we may expense. We believe that excluding the development costs for these 3 projects gives better clarity into the ongoing results of our business since earnings from these efforts will likely only be realized in 2020 and beyond. We will be disciplined in our approach regarding development spending, and we'll periodically update you on our progress. Amounts expensed will be reflected in our GAAP numbers. We expect to have more updates on LNG projects at our Analyst Conference in New York on March 26. At that time, we will also provide updated 2015 guidance on a business unit level, as well as our long-term projected growth rate. With regard to the dividend, the Sempra board voted to increase our annualized dividend by 6% to $2.80 per share. Given our target payout ratio of 45% to 50%, this increase allows for a smoother path towards payout in 2019 when a full year of Cameron Liquefaction earnings is expected to begin. The increase in the dividend reflects the confidence we have in our long-term growth, and it's consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend. To reiterate Debbie's message at the beginning of this call, our underlying businesses are performing well. We are executing on our development projects, and we are on track to achieve results in the upper end of our expected 9% to 11% earnings per share growth rate for the period 2014 to 2019. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take the first question today from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : A couple of questions. First one is when you look at the impact of FX for fiscal year '15 versus fiscal year '14 using the assumptions that you're making, year-over-year how much of a headwind is that? Debra L. Reed: I'm going to have Joe address the FX issue. As you know, we have FX going one way in South America and FX going the opposite way in Mexico, because the Mexico FX is related to Mexican tax code. And since we have dollar-denominated contracts in Mexico, but we pay the tax in the peso, it kind of creates a natural hedge. But I'll have Joe talk about the 2014 to 2015. Joseph A. Householder: Greg, thanks. It creates some modest reduction in our South America utility earnings because we're using the year-end forward curve for the year, and that creates some downward pressure. But we've seen in the last several years that the Mexican tax pretty much offsets it. But we don't -- we're not providing any details at that level. [indiscernible] it's 1 million -- it was $1 million this year. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Okay. So all things equal, you're not building in a big headwind from FX net-net? Joseph A. Householder: No. Debra L. Reed: No. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Okay. I just wanted to be sure. Debra L. Reed: And let me just be clear that when we do that, we look at the forward curves and we look at what is -- what the market curves are and that's what we put in our plan. So we don't do numbers that are not consistent with what the market curves are. Joseph A. Householder: And the natural hedge from this, as I said before, works really well when all 3 currencies kind of move in tandem at the same time, and that doesn't always happen, but that's what we've witnessed the last several years. Operator : We'll now go to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Just a question with regard to the growth rate and going to kind of the upper end of the 9% to 11%. Is that on the basis that you gave at the Analyst Day last year, where you're only including Cameron for 2019? Or is that on kind of a more normal basis where you're including all the businesses for 2019? Debra L. Reed: Okay. When we gave you the 9% to 11% last year, it was looking at the composite growth rate for Sempra as a whole, and it includes Cameron trains 1 through 3. And we're going to go through this in detail with an update at the Analyst Meeting. But as I said in my prepared remarks, with where we are now and some of the additional project opportunities we've already contracted, like pipelines in Mexico, the REX uplift and all, we feel that in the 2014 through 2019 period, we would be towards the upper end of that range. And we will go through how we get there. And I think you'll see at the Analyst Meeting that we have quite high visibility to the achievability of the upper end of that range. And then we also have quite high visibility of some additional upside that could either make that range higher or could extend that beyond 2019. And we'll talk about all of that in detail at the Analyst Meeting. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And then my other question is just, I'm sure at the Analyst Day, you'll talk more about the LNG export environment for new contracts, but maybe if you can give us a little sense of the likelihood that -- when should we expect that you might have some kind of commitment to MOU for additional LNG export growth for Cameron 4 and 5 or others? Debra L. Reed: Well, I think you should maybe use the process of 1 through 3 as an example of how it's most likely to roll out for 4 and 5. And you have to basically come up with a conceptual design of the facility to be able to kind of price out the facility. That's kind of what where we are right now with our FERC prefiling that we just made on trains 4 and 5 at Cameron and our DOE FTA filing. And then that's when you can really start your commercial activity because you have a project you can talk about that has some conceptual framework around it. So the active marketing really begins right around now, and we have had numerous contacts with customers. And on -- about all 3 of our projects, there remains a lot of interest, as I said in my remarks. And we'll talk about the groups of customers and their interest in each of the projects and what drives their interest in each of the projects in more detail at the Analyst Conference. Mark, did you want to add anything to that? Mark Alan Snell : Yes, the only thing I would say is that we are talking actively with customers, but we need to do some of this preliminary work and engineering so that we can get a better ballpark on what the pricing and cost will be. It's very hard for them, obviously, to commit to something if they don't know what it's going to cost. We're highly confident that, especially with trains 4 and 5, that we'll be a low-cost provider and we think that will position us well for additional volumes. And then with -- at ECA too, as well, we believe we can be a relatively low-cost provider given both the existing facility and the transportation advantages that being on the West Coast has. So I think we're coming into the market with 2 projects at least that are -- that should be at the low-end of the cost scale of what people are looking at. And then we have a big opportunity at Port Arthur to build a kind of a big facility, and it could even be a multiuse facility. So I think we're pretty excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us, and we think as we progress during this year with the studies and the engineering work, the things that we need to do to get permitted, that we'll be in a good position to sign up people. Operator : We'll now go to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just a follow-up on the last question. If we look back to the 2012 process for trains 1 through 3, could you just walk us through kind of the ultimate offtake agreements there? I know there were just commercial development agreements at that time, but my understanding was the 3 counterparties were each signed up for 1/3 of the ultimate capacity and that they did not, at that time, know what they would do to sell that gas in any kind of firm way. So does that differ at all from this time around and where you are in the process now Debra L. Reed: No. I think the process would be quite similar. I mean, we filed our FERC prefiling and our FTA at DOE, and then that helped define the project. And then a few months after that, we had the MOU, I think it was actually about 6 months after that, 5 months after that, we had the MOU with those parties. And we had the structure that's framed up for Cameron's trains 4 and 5, because it's very much like the structure of Cameron's trains 1 through 3. So Mark, do you want to just go in more detail? Mark Alan Snell : Yes, to give a little -- to shed a little more light on that. So when we did the first 3 trains, we've started the FERC process and went through this, and we had agreements with partners that, subject to certain conditions, they would sign up for firm capacity. And so we're moving -- as we move through that process and as we got various permits, including our non-FTA, we got our fixed price construction contract and we got a handle on ultimate delivery, those we met some of the conditions precedent and then those commitments to take that capacity became legally binding at a point in time. It'll be similar to that here. The difference here is that we already have all of the operating agreements in place. We know how the facility is going to operate. We know how we're going to share costs. We have all of those kinds of agreements done. So a lot of the heavy lifting has been done, and it's really a matter of our partners marketing the extra capacity that they -- the extra LNG that they would produce, and ourselves, because on the expansion, we have the right to take 50% of the capacity subject to the same operating and arrangements that are in trains 1 through 3. And so our plan is to do that and for us to sell that capacity or LNG in the market, and we're working to commercialize that option. So it will -- it's very similar to the first one, but it is slightly different. Debra L. Reed: The other thing that I would say different this time, is the first one it was Sempra doing this, and now it's the joint venture that is doing this. And so the decision that was just made to make these filings was the joint venture partners in addition to Sempra making the decision to move forward. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just to be clear, that point of kind of legal no return for the counterparties to commit after the different kind of domestic logistical hurdles were reached was the MOU, not the commercial development agreement? Mark Alan Snell : Yes. Actually, the point of no return is typically the -- what we call FID, the Firm Investment Decision. So when we sign a contract to extend the construction to trains 4 and 5, when we commit the contracting dollars, at that time we'll be making a firm investment decision and we'll have all those commitments in place. That's usually quickly after that MOU kind of opportunity. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then just to transition back to the expansion of trains 1 through 3, I guess you mentioned that with the FERC process you had known how potentially big it could be in terms of capacity. But then when you filed the DOE applications, you did not know that or you filed for a smaller amount. Was there kind of a political ramification to that where you wanted to be more conservative and not raise a red flag? Or did something change on the kind of engineering and design or end market side that made you want to expand it? Debra L. Reed: No. This something that you're seeing with most of LNG facilities. When most of us filed at DOE, we filed based upon what you thought the actual average annual production was going to be. So at that point, we filed at 12 Mtpa. And then at FERC, they really wanted the nameplate capacity of the facility, which for us, for those 3 trains, was 14.95. And so we got the approval at FERC for the 14.95. We went back, and now, are reconciling the DOE permit to that. And you've seen that from several other of the parties that have already gotten their permit. In fact, I think Freeport just got there the other day for a reconciliation of the 2. So it's fully expected. Others have gotten it. It's not anything other than how the numbers were calculated. Operator : Michael Weinstein with UBS is next. Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Given the recent outcome in the CFE awards and considering that, along with the growing solar portfolio, just wondering how those 2 things impact your decision on TRV versus MLP? And how it might be coloring the decision one way or another? Debra L. Reed: We're going to talk about our structural decision at our Analyst Conference, and we're going to go into all of those details at that time. I would just say that we're very much aware of our assets. We're very much aware of how those assets might fit into the structure. And what we're looking for, as we're looking at structures and the possibility of whether we go forward with this or not, is to -- what adds the greatest value to the Sempra shareholder and what structures would align best with our strategy? And so, we'll go through that at the analyst meeting so that you can have an understanding of how we're thinking about it, and I'd prefer not to say anything further today. Operator : And we'll now go to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just to follow up on the expansion in the capacity of Cameron trains 1 to 3, just wanted to clarify that you had not included that capacity in the earnings guidance you've given previously? And then secondly, how does that capacity work with respect to your existing contracts? Would that be -- does that fall under those contracts? Or would these be like spot cargoes? If you could just comment on that. Debra L. Reed: Yes. First, let me say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, that these trains 1 through 3, the incremental capacity from those trains happens after the facility is up and operational and producing where you don't have as much shutdown, you don't have as much opportunity, I mean, for maintenance and things like that, and that you have greater production. And that would go beyond the 5 years in our plan. And so the numbers that we've given you, where we gave you $300 million to $350 million a year on average, that's what we would still anticipating in the early years of our plan. And then over time, we would be able to have some uplift potential, providing that we can manufacture from the plant more than the 12 Mtpa and that our customers are willing to take that and export that. And the terms of that have all been part of our original contract, how that gets calculated. And as I said that we just gave you a rough number of, if you added 1 Mtpa per year of export, that, that would be about $30 million upside to us when it would occur. It's not in our planned numbers, it's not part of the $300 million to $350 million, it's upside to that, but it would not be in our 5 year-plan period. So that's why I try to make it clear because we made these filings, they're public. We wanted to be fully transparent and ensure you understood exactly what we were doing. Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Understood. And then could you comment on how your discussions with potential customers for your LNG expansion plans as well as your confidence in the viability of these projects has changed in light of this recent drop in oil prices versus the discussions you were having when oil was in the 90s. Debra L. Reed: Yes. The thing that I would say is first off, the buyers of these facilities are looking at 20- to 25-year contracts. So spot oil prices are not a determining factor for them in terms of looking at a long-term investment in these facilities. If that was the case, gas prices have gone down a lot, too. But how our customers look at this is they look at having a portfolio of LNG assets to meet some of their needs. The world demand in LNG is expected to increase considerably over the next 10 years. And they're looking at having LNG that can provide that need that gives them some optionality. And the things that have been really good about the U.S. projects are that they allow freedom of destination for export, which has not been true with some of the other contracts. And probably even more importantly than that, they have a liquid hub with upstream development that's already been there, with a robust pipeline infrastructure, with -- E&P work that someone else is paying for. And then they have a Henry Hub tradable point. So from the standpoint of our customers, they're very interested in having the opportunity to acquire LNG that has that kind of flexibility to it, and that's what we hear back. And then what we also hear back is that some of the customers like Port Arthur, because they could take equity there and that they could do a multipurpose facility. Some of the customers like Cameron trains 4 and 5 because they feel that it would be -- it's one of the lowest-cost projects that's been done and that for Cameron trains 1 through 3, 4 and 5 should be somewhere similar and that they see this optionality that I talk about. And some of them like ECA because they like the idea of a West Coast facility that could be built and access markets without going through the Panama Canal. So you have customers with different interests and different needs for the facility. And there's been a great deal of customer interest in the facilities. And LNG and oil are not fungible fully, so that Tokyo Gas is going to need gas. They can't use oil. So it doesn't really matter what the cost of oil is in that regard. And so I think there's too much connection to that because of the way pricing was done. The other thing I would say is that many facilities, if you looked at the price of oil today and you looked at tariffing on that basis, they could never get built because their just cost to build that facility would not be justified on an oil-linked price today. So if anything, we think it improves the competitiveness of some of the projects that are in the U.S. Mark, do you want to add anything to that? Mark Alan Snell : I would just summarize by just saying on the -- you've got 2 parts to this, the consumption side and on the consumption side, natural gas, once you've made the commitment to natural gas as a fuel for generation or industrial usage, you're not switching back and forth between oil and natural gas. So the price of oil, other than the old crude-linked formulas, is really the only connection. It doesn't have that. And then on the supply side, there is a big advantage to the U.S. LNG because the biggest advantages -- the commitment that you need to make to buy LNG from the U.S. is less than it is than in most other places because all of the upstream development's already in place and you don't have to commit to pay for that over 20 years, it's already there. So you're really only committing to the facility, and that's a big advantage for customers on the supply side. So I think if you just think of it that way, you'll see that the U.S. LNG will remain competitive for a long time. Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to ask one more on the Mexico pipeline opportunities. You talked about the roughly $1.8 billion in CapEx on these upcoming 4 bids this year. I know you've said in the past you're not baking any of that into your long-term earnings guidance. So from that perspective, anything you get would be upside. But I suspect you'd be fairly disappointed if you don't win anything. And if that's fair, what would you be happy with? What -- how can we kind of gauge success on those bids? Debra L. Reed: What I would be happy with is to get them all for the kind of returns that we would like to have. So I mean, that's -- it's not how many we get, it's how profitable they are. And we run our business to provide shareholder value. And when we lose a bid, we look at it and we say, would we have wanted to have it for that? And most times I will tell you, we say no, that's not something we would have done because we have other ways we can invest our capital that will give us higher return. And so for us, it's about the discipline and the biddings and about -- we would be, obviously, disappointed if we don't get some of these. But as you've correctly stated, we don't have these in our plan, so it would be upside. Operator : And we'll now go to Faisel Khan with Citi. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : On the -- just a couple of questions on the operating results and then some broader questions. First question, on SoCal, SoCalGas, I understand the sort of movements around taxes there and the tax benefits last year versus this year. But if I go above the line to sort of operating income or EBIT, or even for that matter, operating margin, it looks like year-over-year in the quarter, it looks like, basically, operating profit was flat year-over-year. So I mean, I'm just trying to see how the growth is coming through at SoCal with all the capital you guys are spending in the business? Debra L. Reed: Yes. I'm going to have Joe talk about that. But I will say that 2014 was kind of a transition year. We were waiting for the PSEP decision to come out and starting up on a lot of the CapEx that you're going to start seeing flowing through the plan. So let me have Joe talk in particular about the year-over-year. And then Dennis is here, and he can talk about kind of what he's looking at and some of the changes in 2015 over 2014. Joseph A. Householder: Faisel, yes, when you look at the tables -- I guess that's what you were looking at, is the tables. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Yes, the supplementary tables. Joseph A. Householder: And one thing that these tables -- yes, one thing that they don't show is that last year, we had still some of the retro income from the rate case delay, and so these throw you off. When you look at that, it looks like $124 million, $124 million. But last year, there was income in the numbers from the retroactive piece. And so they actually do have nice growth from year-to-year and the taxes -- between the 2 utilities, we had like $20 million of tax benefits last year and $21 million this year. It just happen to be between the 2 utilities. If you look at the 2 utilities in total, there's nice growth. But I'll let Dennis respond if there's anything else in there. But you had at least $25 million in revenue impact last year from the retro and some depreciation impact. So actually, their numbers look better than they do on the sheet. Dennis? Dennis V. Arriola: Faisel, what I'd say is with the capital that we're spending and as Debbie mentioned, in '14, we're really well-positioned for the growth that we're going to see in '15. With PSEP now fully charging forward, you're going to see a full year of earnings related to that. And with the acceleration in advanced meter, that's continuing to go well. The other thing is by accelerating the Advanced Metering program in 2014, we did incur some additional operating expenses there that we won't necessarily have in years -- in 2015 as well. So when we look at those 2 programs plus the continuing growth in AFUDC related to projects like our Aliso storage replacement, we're really confident that the range that we gave out in 2015 [ph] at the analyst conference, we're on track for that for earnings. Joseph A. Householder: Faisel, this is Joe. It just occurred -- dawned on me. I was actually really thinking about the annual numbers, because the retro piece was in the first quarter. It wasn't in the fourth. But I think the points that Dennis just made addressed the fourth quarter. If you look at the annual piece, I still think if you back out the retro, it looks okay, it looks good. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Okay, got you. And then if I look at the EPS guidance you guys laid out today for '15, what's the assumed sort of tax rate in that number? I think you may have mentioned it and I may have missed it in your prepared remarks. Joseph A. Householder: This is Joe. The tax rate for 2015 is about 29%. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then going back to the, Debbie, your comments on the extra 2.9 million tons of potential LNG capacity at the plant. So the 12 million tons is what you have contracted. So I just want to make sure I understood this, so you'd have to actually contract for the extra 3 million tons to your existing customers, is that what you were saying in your remarks? Debra L. Reed: I'll have Mark go through kind of how that works. Mark Alan Snell : Okay. So if we're talking -- you're talking about the extra tonnage because of the sort of the de-bottlenecking the extra nameplate capacity? Okay. Yes, we actually -- that extra tonnage was contemplated when we did the agreement. So we get paid for making that available. If we make it available and it's used, we get paid a specific fee for that. And that's the calculation that we gave you that said it's about $30 million per ton per annum. And so we won't get that all the time. It will be intermittent. It -- because you do have to maintain these facilities, so there will be some times we'll be taking the facility down and it will earn less in its nameplate capacity, but we will have opportunities to really exceed it. And when we do that, we have a formula for getting paid. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Understood. And then last question for me, just as you guys are thinking about sort of the performance in the stock, which has been great over the last 12 to 18 months, and sort of the -- everything you guys have lined up for the next several years, how are you guys thinking about acquisitions at this point? I mean you've seen some volatility at least in the midstream sector. I mean, what's your philosophy right now on acquisitions? Is the table sort of set and you don't need to -- you're not interested in anything? Or does it make sense to go out and look for things? Debra L. Reed: Well, we always look for things. And I think that with the markets having a little bit of instability right now and watching what's happening with some companies who really need to raise capital and are looking at getting rid of certain assets, that this is a good time for us to be shopping if there are some good assets on the market, and we look all the time. But what we look at is assets that will add value to the shareholder or give us a strategic advantage where 1 plus 1 equals more than 2, and that we really are very particular. As you said, we have a great growth rate that is just based from the organic growth that we have in our business. We are in a wonderful position where we don't have to make acquisitions in order to grow. So the way we look at it is, is this going to be a benefit to our shareholders? Is it going to add to our portfolio? Is it going to give us greater long-term growth? Or is it going to give us the opportunity to extend our growth beyond our 5-year period significantly above our peers? And that's the way we look at acquisitions. So if we find some things, we're always interested if they fit that. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I guess, the one reason why I'm asking is that a lot of the growth that you have -- you've got set up right now for the company over the next few years or several years, for that matter, is -- are sort of acquisitions or sort of investments you made sort of many years ago that are sort of driving a lot of that growth. So like how do you guys think about trying to set up for the next decade with the portfolio you have? Debra L. Reed: That's a great question, and we actually have a team that's working on beyond 5 and what are the things that we should be doing to create the foundations for future growth. And that is part of our strategic review process that we're going through. I mean, not -- I guess not too many companies are fortunate enough to have the visibility 5 years out to the growth [ph]. And what we want to do is set it up so that we have visibility not just 5 years, but 10 and 15 years out, and we are already working on that. It's a great question. Operator : And we'll go to Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : So you've talked a lot about the Cameron project. I did want to flip it a little bit back to some of your comments about the opportunity in Mexico. You've kind of addressed this a little bit, but when you're looking at the bid process, you've obviously been successful, you have a recent success, and you're looking back on some of the bids you didn't want and why you didn't get them, talking about the returns process. But just wondering if how does it -- how final does this bidding process feel to you at this point? Feedback from the CFE, improvements that you'd like to see. Is there anything, I guess, in the process itself that would make it, I don't know, would make it easier for you to evaluate these projects? Debra L. Reed: I'm going to ask Mark to answer that. We've gone through the full analysis of the bids and I would say that the -- that the bidding process is a pretty solid process, from what we see. And it's pretty clear. And I would say the U.S. pipeline bids were not as clear at the beginning, but they became clearer towards the end. The one thing that I think, and it was said on our IEnova call today, that we're all having to look at a little differently, is that when they bid these pipelines, they bid them to a certain capacity. And what many of the bidders are doing is looking at beyond that capacity that's going to be contracted and what is the market potential to add compression or to broaden the opportunities on the pipeline. And so I think that's one thing that we're seeing from bidders now is that they're looking not just at the first contract, but what could you do to grow that. Mark, do you want to... Mark Alan Snell : Yes, I'll just elaborate a little bit on that. I would say one of the things that we're seeing from the bid process as a whole, it's actually quite good. It seems to be relatively -- it seems to be fair. They're looking at the right things and they kind of break it into 2 parts. There's a capital part and then the net present value over the future payments that the customer would take, whether that's CFE or PEMEX. So they've done this in, I think, a logical way. But to Debbie's point, one of the things that I think that will necessitate winning bidders to do in the future is to anticipate some additional revenue and capacity that would be used by the market, because all of these will be open access pipelines. They will eventually attract other customers and you got to kind of figure that into your net present value of your cash flow stream. And so, I think that it's going to keep a competitive process for Mexico. I guess the thing that I would add to that -- so I think we're looking at that and I think we can make adjustments for that. But I do think the thing that's most important is we've got these other group of bids that are coming out here shortly, but we have a whole list of other projects that are going to come out during the year. And the most encouraging thing we've seen is, in spite and maybe because of the drop in oil prices, the need for outside investment in Mexican infrastructure continues to grow. There seems to be no reluctance on the part of CFE or PEMEX to get moving on some of these projects because they're critically needed to deliver gas into the bowels [ph] of Mexico, and we really want to make sure that those projects that they're developing down there that are going to use this gas are all moving forward, and they are. And so I think all of this speaks very well for the additional investment. And we are, even though that we watch our returns and we want to make sure that we get a good return on our investment, we're still in one of the best competitive advantage -- in one of the best competitive places to be from having an advantage of just being the incumbent and the largest incumbent. Our relationship with the contractors and the pipe producers and the things that we've been using in Mexico, really, I think, we can be very quite competitive, and I think we'll do well. Debra L. Reed: So one other thing that we didn't mention is that in addition to the 4 pipelines, they're also putting a bid out for gas supply at Baja Sur. And in that, they're allowing you to construct how you would get the gas there, whether it's by pipeline or it's by LNG. And I think we're starting to see a little more breadth in the type of bids that are coming out, and that pays to our sweet spot -- plays to our sweet spot where we can be creative in how we use the assets that we already have in Mexico and we take those and work them together in a way that puts a really attractive package on the table. So I think we feel very good about this, but we also are going to be very disciplined. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Great. Now that's some really nice commentary. I appreciate that. And maybe to kind of pick up where you mentioned on the competitive advantage side and given how successful you've already been and seem to be so far, I mean, does that kind of change the appetite for maybe partnering with other large multinationals in pursuing some of the larger projects? Is that still an option that you are considering when you look at particular -- the larger bids perhaps? Debra L. Reed: Yes, I mean, we always look at partners. But what we want to be sure is both partners bring something to the table. In terms of just bringing capital to the table, we feel that we have great opportunities in Mexico to raise capital for this. But if there's something strategic that they bring to the table, that combined with us, would make us more competitive, we'd certainly look at that. Operator : And we'll go to Winfried Fruehauf with W. Fruehauf Consulting. Winfried Fruehauf : Assuming the market price for LNG produced at Cameron is petroleum-based or petroleum-related, and assuming current petroleum prices would remain at or below current levels for 5 years, would this, in your opinion, affect the ability and willingness of the offtakers to proceed under the terms of the contract? Debra L. Reed: If you're talking about the trains 1 through 3, no. I would not expect that. I mean, we have a very tight contract. The other thing, and the way we structure trains 1 through 3, is our customers are our partners. And so we had envisioned that if there was upturns or downturns in the LNG market, the fact that they're paying theirselves is an advantage under this. And so what you have with this is you have some, as you're pointing out, some credit risk. I certainly think GDF, Mitsui and Mitsubishi are very strong credits and that they look at this as a long-term investment for them. So I wouldn't see that, Winfried. Operator : We'll now go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just on the -- almost all my questions have been answered, and I apologize if I missed this, but the non-capitalized development costs for the additional LNG projects, what was the amount that you guys are seeing, that you guys are expecting, for that in 2015? And how should we think about what that might look like going forward in the future? Debra L. Reed: Okay. I'll ask Joe to answer that one. Joseph A. Householder: Paul, the reason that we are excluding it from guidance, as Debbie mentioned, are severalfold. But we actually are not able to estimate it right now, and that's why we didn't give a number and we didn't put a range for it, because we expect to be spending this money, but as Debbie said, we're going to be disciplined. We also have partners in these projects, and so we are not sure at this point in time how much we're going to spend versus how much we're going to collect from partners. And then as we work through getting customers signed up for MOUs, at some point, we'll be able to capitalize the costs. So we just -- we cannot, right now, estimate the amount that we may ultimately spend. Mark, I don't know if you have anything to add that you'd like to. Mark Alan Snell : No. I think that's right. We really just can't estimate it now, and because of the difference in capitalization or expense, we just thought it would be best to exclude it. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So you're just calling it out... Debra L. Reed: One thing also, I just think from a transparency standpoint that you'll be able to see this because we'll be reporting earnings and you'll be able to see, as we're reporting, how much we're spending. And then -- so it makes it more transparent to you, and I think that's a positive way to handle it. When you can't really estimate something and it's something that's really leading up to your FERC filing, and then you guys will be able to see. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. I understand that, I don't want to make too much of it. I just was sort of wondering though, how long do you think this will be a separate issue that you guys will be calling out, just the... Debra L. Reed: No. I mean, what we're looking at is we're looking at getting the filings done this year on all of these. So this is the expenditures that would occur before the filing and a lot depends on, as was said, when you get partners, when you get MOUs and what the capitalization policy is versus the expense policy. And the fact that we have 3 going at one time this year is quite unusual. So I wouldn't see this as being an ongoing thing and it's really expenditures for projects that really will be beyond our 5-year plan, so. Mark Alan Snell : Paul, one thing is, if we develop these projects beyond this year, likely, all these costs will continue to get capitalized. Operator : And next is Ashar Khan with Visium. Ashar Khan : Debbie, one thing, as you go out -- and we look forward to the Analyst Day, but we had one in the beginning of the year for the company. But I hope one thing which would come out is you're doing your strategy is on this Total Return Vehicle, me being a Sempra holder, is how does this enhance my valuation when you select whatever that is? And I'm hoping it is through a better growth rate in earnings or something like that which you can quantify that this vehicle would provide valuation uplift to the parent company, which has been somewhat missing in what we saw earlier this year. I hope that comes out very clearly as you pursue this path that we, as Sempra shareholders, what are we going to get by having this TRV vehicle? Debra L. Reed: Well, if we decide to do a TRV, then how we explain that -- we have heard this from a number of our investors and it is one of the most important things on our mind in consideration about this. And if you go forward on it, is where is the value creation for the Sempra shareholders? Where does that come from? Obviously, that -- there are all sorts of rules regarding communication and what you can do and what you can do when. And if we decide to go forward with this, we have to comply with those rules. But we hear you. And that if we decide to go forward, that I hear what you're saying, and that we will make every effort to address it. Operator : And Michael Weinstein with UBS has a follow-up question. Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just a quick follow-up. I think you were alluding before to a possible decoupling of LNG pricing from oil pricing, given the drop in oil on the spot market. I'm just wondering if that is indeed what you're trying to say and what you're seeing out there, that we might be seeing a natural decoupling? Debra L. Reed: Yes, to some degree. I'll have Mark talk. Mark Alan Snell : Yes, it's -- look, there are numerous LNG contracts around the world that are linked to oil prices and they call it the crude cocktail price or you've heard those terms. But the change that's coming, that's happening is really not one of a decoupling, but it's diversification which is going to -- that's entering another mix into this, and that is a Henry Hub-based LNG price. So most of -- in fact, all of the LNG so far, I think that's been sold out of the United States, has had some kind of index back to Henry Hub. So it's giving the purchasers a mix in their portfolio of a different pricing, and that was very popular, obviously, when crude was very, very high. But the popularity hasn't diminished because crude has gone down in price. I think there is a big desire by the -- especially the Japanese and the Koreans, to diversify their pricing mix and to have some different points -- different pricing points. So I think that's purely what it is. And it's a very small percentage now of their overall mix. It's growing. But we're not anywhere near where they are full up with Henry Hub-based price. I think there's still a lot of room to go. Operator : And that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn it back to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks. Debra L. Reed: Well, thanks, again, for joining us today. I hope to see you all at our Analyst Conference in New York on March 26. As you heard today, we have a lot of interesting things to be covering at that conference. And in the meantime, please feel free to contact our IR team and have a great day. Operator : And that does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation, and have a great day.",

(Broker) Michael Dandurand - Goldman Sachs & Co. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Richard A. Vaccari - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's first quarter 2015 financial results. A live webcast for this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of Southern California Gas Company; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric Company. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 5, 2015, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Rick. I'd like to start this morning by thanking all of you who were able to join us for our March Analyst Conference in New York City. I appreciate all of the useful feedback we received. At that meeting, we outlined our five-year plan and how we think about our growth and opportunities looking forward. The key themes of the conference were : we have a five-year base plan that is built on conservative assumptions and provides a high degree of visibility to our earnings projections. Our base plan is expected to yield approximately 11% compound annual earnings growth from 2015 to 2019, and we have already identified $7 billion to $8 billion worth of growth opportunities that could provide upside to our base plan. In addition to those opportunities, we are working to advance our three potential LNG development projects that could provide earnings post-2019. For those unable to attend the event, you can find all of this information in the Analyst Conference Presentation on our website. And for today, you will see that we are already making progress executing on our strategy. Moving to our financial performance. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $428 million or $1.71 per share. When comparing earnings on a quarterly basis, please keep in mind the impact from applying seasonality to SoCalGas earnings beginning in 2015. Dennis discussed this item at the Analyst Conference and showed that substantially all of SoCalGas' annual earnings will now be reported in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Though seasonality will not affect full-year 2015 earnings, it resulted in $113 million of increased earnings in the first quarter, relative to the same period last year. Absent this impact, we still had a very strong start to the year. And our financial results kept us on track to achieve our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance. Our California Utilities provided outstanding operating performance and across the company, we have made progress on our base plan projects and development opportunities. For today's call, I will begin with a brief regulatory and operational update before I hand the call over to Joe to discuss our first quarter earnings in more detail. Joe will also take a moment to clarify elements of the TRV discussion we had at the Analyst Conference. Hopefully, this will help further address some of your questions. Please turn to slide five. A key priority for our California Utilities this year, is to achieve a successful regulatory outcome for the general rate case. Since our last earnings call, the GRC was reassigned to President Picker, and the schedule for public hearings was established. The schedule calls for the issuance of a draft decision by year-end. On April 2, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, ORA, submitted their report on our GRC requests. ORA recommended that our requested 2016 revenue requirement, be reduced by approximately 9% for SDG&E and 7.5% for SoCalGas. ORA also recommended that both utilities receive inflation increases for 2017 and 2018 of at least 3.5%. As we explained at our Analyst Conference, our GRC requests were pretty modest and take into account good cost management. ORA's report is focused on issues they have raised in the past, and their suggested reductions are not as large as prior recommendations for California investor-owned utilities, likely due to the prudent requests we made. After evaluating ORA's report, we will file rebuttal testimony and commence settlement discussions. Now, please turn to slide six. In April, we also received a proposed decision or PD on long-term rate reform. The PD entails comprehensive reforms to residential rates intended to make them more fair, transparent and reflective of actual cost-of-service. The PD includes a reduction in the number of tiers from four to three this year and down to two tiers next year. Rate differentials between the tiers would gradually be reduced from 2015 through 2019. To ensure all customers contribute some amount to cover utility fixed infrastructure costs, the PD includes a $10 monthly minimum bill provision. It also allows for consideration of a customer fixed charge as part of a 2018 utility filing on proposed time-of-use rates. The PD calls for implementation to begin in July of this year with more significant changes beginning in 2016. While we see the direction of the PD as favorable, we will file comments encouraging the CPUC to go further, faster. Let's now go to slide seven for a business update. Regarding our base plan activities, I am pleased to announce that the binding open season for expansion on the REX pipeline has concluded, and we now have a 0.7 Bcf per day of capacity contracted for 15 years. The expansion will be achieved primarily through compression, with an estimated total cost of about $530 million at the partnership level. We expect the project to be in service by year-end 2016 and to provide us with about $10 million of annual earnings that are already included in our base plan. Shifting to our Renewables business, Copper Mountain Solar 2 and 3 are now both fully in service, bringing our total renewable operating portfolio to about 970 megawatts. Regarding development opportunities not in our base plan, we recently acquired the 78-megawatt Black Oak Getty wind project in Minnesota. The wind farm has a 20-year power purchase agreement with the Minnesota Municipal Power Agency and we expect the project to be in operation by year-end 2016. In Mexico, we will participate in the next round of CFE pipeline bids. Currently, the CFE has three pipelines, with bids due in May through July that represent total estimated CapEx of around $1.3 billion. The CFE has announced two other projects with bids expected this year that represent another $1 billion of investment. We discussed at the Analyst Conference our continued interest in these opportunities, our competitive advantages and the potential for adding capacity commitments from industrial buyers. For your reference, we provide updated information on CFE bids in the appendix to this presentation. As a final note, I am pleased to announce that we completed the sale of the remaining block of the Mesquite Power Plant in April. In the second quarter, we will record an approximate $34 million after-tax gain on the sale, subject to working capital adjustments. As we have discussed previously, this gain was not included in our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance. Sempra will receive approximately $350 million in proceeds, which we will use to pay down short-term debt. With that, please turn to slide eight for a discussion of the quarterly earnings. Joe? Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $437 million or $1.74 per share. First quarter adjusted earnings were $428 million or $1.71 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude two items. First, we recorded a benefit of $13 million after-tax from a reduction to the loss on the SONGS plant closure. The reduction reflects the CPUC's approval in March 2015 of SDG&E's revenue requirement associated with the SONGS settlement. Second, as we have previously noted, we will be adjusting earnings for expenses related to the development of our three proposed LNG liquefaction projects. In the first quarter of 2015, we recorded $4 million of after-tax expense. Debbie mentioned at the start of this call that compared with 2014, first quarter earnings now reflect the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas' revenues. This change alone increased earnings by $113 million relative to the first quarter of last year. The application of seasonality in revenues for SoCalGas will result in substantially all of their earnings being recorded in the first and fourth quarters. But it will not affect the full-year earnings result. We discussed this change at the Analyst Conference, and provide an updated illustration in the appendix that shows how seasonality would have impacted quarterly earnings in 2014, using our effective tax rate. Excluding this impact, operating earnings at SoCalGas still increased relative to the first quarter of last year. Combined with strong operating performance at SDG&E and solid results in our other businesses, we had a very strong first quarter and they're on track to achieve our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance. Please turn to slide nine. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation entitled, Business Unit Earnings. I'll address here the key drivers for our consolidated earnings this quarter. In addition to the seasonality impact, first quarter adjusted earnings increased over the same period last year due in large part to $30 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities that reflect higher CPUC and FERC margins, net of operating expenses. In addition, Sempra International recorded $11 million of higher earnings, primarily from growth in sales in Peru and earnings from the Los Ramones I pipeline and a section of the Sonora pipeline that were placed into service in Mexico. In the first quarter of 2014, our Renewables business included $16 million of earnings from the sale of a 50% equity interest in the Copper Mountain Solar 3 project. Now, before we go to questions, I would like to take a moment to revisit the preferred structure for a possible TRV that we discussed at our Analyst Conference. A couple of questions were raised after the conference and I want to ensure there is clarity regarding the structure we discussed. For your reference, we list these points in the appendix. Our preferred TRV structure would be a publicly-traded partnership with a corporate subsidiary. The partnership would directly house assets with MLP qualifying income, while the corporate subsidiary would house assets with non-MLP qualifying income and pay dividends to the partnership. Dividends are qualifying income for the partnership under the tax rules. This structure has been used by other MLPs and provides a tax shield for both the MLP qualifying and non-qualifying income due to the step-up in tax basis. Creating a long-term tax yield at the corporate subsidiary, would likely not require use of any renewable tax credits. And if we were to establish a TRV, Sempra's share of any partnership income, would be taxed at Sempra's marginal tax rate. The partnership could be eligible for inclusion in an MLP index and investors would receive a K-1 versus a 1099. In the event that we decide to proceed, we anticipate issuing a press release, that would generally disclose the assets we intend to put into the TRV, the purpose and timing of the offering, and the basic terms of the securities. As you have seen with other entities that have issued a similar press release, SEC rules would prohibit us from speaking further about the matter beyond what would be in that press release. Now, let's conclude with slide 10. Overall, our financial and operating results for the quarter were very strong and support our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Excluding the impact of seasonality and SoCalGas' revenues, our first quarter adjusted earnings increased significantly compared to the same period last year, driven largely by increased operating earnings at the California Utilities. Across the company, we made progress in executing on projects within our base plan and furthered efforts to capture additional development opportunities. With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you may have. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. So quick clarifying question on the TRV, if you will. And we're probably in store for a few more after this. But at the publicly-traded level, this isn't an MLP, and it is more of a comp in the context of a YieldCo than it is an MLP, correct? And vis-\u00e0-vis the taxation \u2013 the tax benefit is more in the step-up akin to a YieldCo than it is an MLP, if I could be very clear about that. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. I'm going to ask Joe to kind of walk through this to the extent we can and how we've done some modeling of how this might all work, so. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Julien. How are you doing? Thanks for the question. Actually, this is more akin to an MLP than it is to a YieldCo. So in the appendix, I've republished the slide that we had at the Analyst Conference, and on that slide 23 in the new deck, that publicly-traded partnership in the medium blue color, that is akin to an MLP. So we would be the GP and have LP units, and the public partners would be like MLP partners in a publicly-traded partnership. That publicly-traded partnership would hold our midstream assets, our LNG assets, other assets that would qualify under those rules. And then it would also own this corporate subsidiary and the corporate subsidiary would hold assets such as our renewable assets. And then those would be shielded by tax benefits and would produce dividends that would be qualifying for the MLP. So the characterization of the tax benefits will be more akin to an MLP and the public partners, each time they buy in, would get a step-up to their price. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Julien, is that clear? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Well, if I can follow-up just for a quick second. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : The parent here, the actually publicly-traded element, that would be more of a \u2013 it would be more of an MLP but it wouldn't benefit from the MLP tax benefits coming up from the qualifying income? Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No. Yes, it would. It absolutely... Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : It would. Okay. Great. Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : It will be essentially an MLP, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And is there any limitations then on the qualifying dividends from the corporate subsidiary? Just to be clear. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No. Those dividends are qualifying dividends and then the MLP qualifying income, the LNG income or other midstream income is just like any other MLP. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Moving on, just in terms of California and looking at the SONGS situation, your peers to the north discussed or released several e-mails of late, et cetera, do you have any intentions or plans to file anything comparable related to the settlement process on your side or any other comment you might want to add vis-\u00e0-vis the latest development? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Julien, no. And we have not had any data requests. We've had no subpoenas, nothing of that nature that we've looked at all the documents that our fellow utilities to the north have filed and we don't see anything in those documents that concern us at all. So as far as we're concerned, that issue is not relevant to SDG&E at this time. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for being so clear. Operator : We'll go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks. Looking at the first quarter numbers, if we were to just try to adjust for the seasonality issue, would it be fair to sort of, if we took the $113 million out of the quarter, assuming that you were earning it over the course of the rest of the year, and just looked at that earnings number, that would be a good \u2013 would that be a reasonable comp to last year? Because it looks, you would have been sort of $1.41 without the seasonality, which was still sort of a few pennies above the consensus. Is that a fair way to look at it or not? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : That's a fair way to look at it. And if you look at it, year-over-year, doing it that way and then adjusting for SONGS and LNG, which we say we take out of our adjusted earnings target, and adjusting for those in both years, certainly SONGS in both years. You end with a more than 17% year-over-year growth rate in earnings. So we feel it looks like a really strong quarter, and it was driven by outstanding performance by our two California Utilities and our international operations. And so we just felt \u2013 if I look at our history, in fact I had them pulled the numbers today, it was the strongest first quarter we've ever had. And one of the strongest quarters Sempra has ever had in its entire history. So we just are feeling really good about the results that came out first quarter. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Follow-up question. Is there anything you can tell us with regard to commercial milestones that we can look for, and then in the coming months, the several different LNG export projects that you're working on, whether it's Costa Azul, the Greenfield at Port Arthur or the incremental two trains at Cameron. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. What I'm going to do is I'm going to ask Mark to answer this. But, I would tell you that, Mark and I've even been at meetings with potential partners or counterparties on this. So there is a lot of activity going on and there is a lot of interest in the marketplace still. And so Mark, why don't you talk about it and especially in light of our competitive position. Mark Alan Snell - President: Look. I think there is a lot of little milestones that you're going to see regulatory filings and the like that are going to be proceeding as we go forward, but I think the most important things to take away are \u2013 is that in the environment that we're operating in now, I think people lose sight of the fact that we still have an increasing demand for LNG worldwide, and we have continued interest in these facilities. And I think the biggest, the most important thing is, is that especially, the facilities in the Gulf, both our Cameron facility and the potential Port Arthur facility are, as we showed you at the Analyst Conference, should be the lowest cost providers of LNG around the world. And so I think there is still strong interest in that. We've met with several interested counterparties and potential customers and we're working on those. We're working on agreements to move these projects forward, and we don't have anything to announce yet, but we feel pretty good about our prospects. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : I would like to add to that... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you very much. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I would just add to that. As a reminder, none of that is in our five-year base plan. So all of that would be any of the expansions at Cameron or the Port Arthur opportunities or ECA opportunities have not been factored into the base plan we showed you at the Analyst Meeting and would give us upside beyond that timeframe of the plant. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got you. Thanks again. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Hi. Good afternoon or good morning to you, guys. Just two very quick questions. Just on the \u2013 on Greg's question just when he was going over the quarter and how that was kind of comparing to your plan and then using the $1.41 as you state. Would it be fair to say just kind of looking at what we have for the second, third and fourth quarters that you're at this point because of the stronger first quarter, again I understand it's early in the year, but trending towards the high end of your guidance range? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we never give guidance within our ranges. So I would say that clearly the first quarter was very strong and that it was driven by operating performance. So it was not driven by a lot of one-time issues. There were a few one-time things, but it was really just very strong operating performance by our businesses. So I'll let you determine where you think we would be within the range. We're keeping our range constant for now. We'll look at it at the end of second quarter. And if we decide to make adjustments, that would be kind of the timeframe when we would typically do that. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Great. Thank you. And then just again on the TRV, I don't know if this is a question you could ask, but when we kind of look at what that marginal rate could potentially be, is there any type of a range you can give on that, whether it's a 35% statutory rate or whether it could end up being different by the time you get out and get this transaction done. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Andy, I'm going to have Joe respond to that the best we can. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Andy. So let me talk to that in two ways because I think there has been some question about what that meant. And what I wrote on the slide was that our share of partnership income would be taxed at the marginal rate. And income, I don't want it to be confused with distributions, because often sometimes investors think of the distributions and they compare a tax rate to what other MLPs, existing MLPs might be paying on their distribution, so please divorce those two. Whatever our share of cash flow is from the business is different from what our taxable income is. Just like today, in our Renewable business, for example, we have a lots of great cash flow from those businesses, but not much taxable income, so we don't pay much tax because it's shielded by depreciation. So all of these assets will have depreciation. I can't obviously forecast it at this point because we don't have all that information out there yet. And so you'll have information at the right time if we move forward and give you a prospectus, so \u2013 but I want you to be sure that you're clear that distributions are different from income. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Great. Thank you very much. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Andy. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi. How are you doing? Just wanted to ask... Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Hi. We're good. Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: It's only been about five weeks since the Analyst Conference, but you talked about having to work through a lot of complications with different partnerships on assets that you could potentially contribute to the TRV. So curious if you can provide an update on how that work is going, and if you're any more or less optimistic that those things can be worked through? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'm going to have Joe talk about that. I would say one of the key issues we talked about at the Analyst Conference that we are still waiting for is the IRS Private Letter Ruling. And we have had discussions with IRS, and it looks like it will be forthcoming at some time in the reasonable future. And that was one of the issues that we talked about at the conference. But I'm going to have Joe talk about how we're working through all of the other issues we presented. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Hi, Matt. Yeah, we laid out for you all the assets that we had, the ones we wholly-owned: the Cameron, the Renewables. And we laid out very clearly for you what we were working on. And as Debbie just mentioned, on the U.S. LNG marketing, we're awaiting for the Private Letter Ruling. We've been talking with the IRS. I would say at this point, it's a little bit of wordsmithing going on and I still feel very confident about that. We've actually finished doing our structuring around the ECO liquefaction opportunity there. And we've made really good progress with some of our counterparties on the Renewables. So we're just in the process of papering some of that stuff up. So we are actually making good progress on these things as we said we would, and we're working hard on it every day. Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then kind of in the same vein, I think, I wanted to ask about this wind project acquisition and I know you haven't baked any more acquisitions like this into your plan. But should we expect you are continuing to look for more opportunities like this? And if so, are you seeing many attractive opportunities or is this just kind of a one-off? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : We are seeing a lot of opportunities and that was the reason we tried to present this to you in the Analyst Meeting with what's in the base plan so you kind of watch us and see us as we capture some of these. And then we're trying to do our slides in a way so that you can really see when we capture some of the upside that could affect during the five-year period and then when we capture upside that could go beyond the five-year period. And so this is the first; a month after the conference we had one to announce. We're working on a number of other things right now that can add growth to the plan. And we talked about at the Analyst Conference, we'd already identified over $7 billion to $8 billion of opportunities that could occur during the five years of the plan that we're working. And every day we're working on those, so I think over time you will continue to see some positive announcements. We just had a leadership meeting and I will tell you, our team is committed to continuing to do development work and to get some projects concluded. And we have a lot of things in the pipe. I was on a pharma company board for a while and they always talked about the pipeline as being critical to the long-term success of that business. And I will tell you, we have a really, really strong pipeline. Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And just one last one on the upcoming bid in Mexico at the CFC. Looks like the timing maybe moved out a month or two on some of those, is that just kind of a typical delays you see, or is there anything else there that we should be aware of? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's a typical delay that we've seen that in pretty much all of the bids that they've come out with. And usually when they get to the point that they are now, where they've actually posted the date, then they generally hold pretty close to that. But some of the early projections that we gave when they listed all of the, almost 20 pipelines on and told us when the bids were going to come out, some of those have slipped a few months. And that's just been typical. Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks, again. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar Equity Research. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Hey. Good morning for you over there. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Hi. How are you? Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Hi. Not badly. I just wanted to ask a quick question. Thanks for all the detail on the TRV. That's very, very helpful. I did want to ask another question though on the Mexican bids here. Obviously it's a lot of capital here. I'm wondering how you've won some bids on your own. If you have still any interests in partnering with other larger multinationals, or how you see that kind of dynamics in the market for bids here, or whether you prefer to go it alone as with just Sempra? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Generally, we've looked at what we need to be competitive and we feel like we just have some natural competitive advantages ourselves. We always look at could a partner bring us more competitive advantages, and so we're open to that. But for us to be able to do these and we look at where we are now in Mexico and the ability that we have to increase our leverage there and to really do a lot more big projects, we haven't felt the need to partner with anyone. And we feel that, if you look at all the pipelines in Mexico and the percentage of them that we own and the work that we've done there, we've really felt like we do have some strong competitive advantages in getting rights of way, having the supplier base that we worked with time and time again and then having the employees that about 600 employees in Mexico that work on these things all the time. So unless we saw someone bringing something to the table that we thought can make us more competitive, we think we're really well positioned. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Thanks for that. That's all I have today. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Most of my questions were answered, but I wanted to ask a little bit more about this incentive award you won at SoCalGas and in particular if there is any other incentive revenues that you're eligible for and how that would work? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. That was from the gas cost incentive mechanism, which we've had in place for 30 years or something. But I'm going to have Dennis talk about at SoCalGas the incentive mechanisms we have. And there's really two categories, the energy efficiency and the gas cost incentive mechanism. And then have Jeff give you the same information for SDG&E, which is really focused on the energy efficiency incentive. Dennis? Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.: Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Yeah. Neel, the way that it works is, as Debbie mentioned, there are two main categories. The gas cost incentive mechanism is set up to basically encourage us to try to buy gas on behalf of our core customers as inexpensively as we can. And if we can do better than a certain benchmark, then shareholders get to reap part of the benefits there. And in the prior year, which we just recorded here in the first quarter of 2015, it was a good year, given the volatility in the gas markets, and as a result, we were able to get approved $8 million of GCIM. The other award that we're waiting for that that we've already applied for is energy efficiency. And ordinarily, that comes in the fourth quarter, and that's probably going to be somewhere in the $2 million range on an after-tax basis. But those are the two main incentive categories that we have at SoCalGas. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Jeff, for SDG&E, please. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Chief Executive Officer & Director, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.: Thank you for the question, Neel. You'll recall that in 2014, SDG&E picked up roughly $7.5 million from energy efficiency awards. And a lot of this has to do with the timing of which calendar years get pulled through. But to Dennis' point, these are usually fourth quarter awards. And for SDG&E, in 2015, there'll be roughly \u2013 our expectation is roughly in the $3 million. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. And my second question, I just wanted to clarify. Last year, the gains from some of your asset sales were included in operational earnings. This year, the Mesquite sale and the gain associated with that in Q2, that won't be part of operations. Is that correct? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. In the first quarter of last year, we had a gain on CMS 4 of $16 million after-tax in Q1 of 2014. And in Q2, we will report a gain of roughly $34 million from Mesquite but that is not included in our guidance numbers. Yes. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I was just going to add on to that. Historically, for the last four years, five years, six years, we have included in our guidance as part of our ongoing Renewable business, gains from the renewable portfolio as we put them into partnerships, because that is part of our business. We develop these projects, and then we've had a strategy of putting them into partnerships. And so that's been kind of part of the ongoing business. Whereas the sale of the Mesquite gas-fired plant is same as what we did when we sold the first half of it and we also excluded that I think in that year. So it's a different thing. It's kind of a one-time sale versus ongoing part of our business. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just want to touch base with you on the LNG marketing. On the slide, it says there is $5 million decrease from that. And I was just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more what was going on there and what the outlook is. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Mark? Yeah. Mark Alan Snell - President: This on the LNG development costs? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : No. On the LNG marketing. Mark Alan Snell - President: The decline, yeah. That's almost entirely \u2013 it's entirely related to gas price declines. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And... Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And the gas price went down to $3 versus $5 a year ago. Mark Alan Snell - President: Yeah. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And so going forward, how do we think about that moving around? Is it going to be sort of the same range? Mark Alan Snell - President: It will \u2013 yeah, Paul, it will move around a little bit with gas prices. But if gas prices go up, then we should recover some of that. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then the Sundry items, it looked like there was an increase in the quarter by about $120 million. And I was wondering what was driving that? And also if it had any EPS impact? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. I'm going to turn it to Joe and Trevor to... Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Paul, a large portion of that increase was greenhouse gas allowances. And there is an offset in other liabilities, things that SDG&E and SoCal collect through customers and owe it. And so it was mostly that. It wasn't the thing you were thinking about, which sometimes we have these gains in the Rabbi trust, and that drives it up. And there was a little bit of \u2013 about there, $9 million, I think. Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller: Yeah. We've separately broken out the Rabbi trust on the line above. So we've got that above it now. So Sundry doesn't have the Rabbi trust in it. This is just solely those items associated with really fixed price contracts and other derivatives in greenhouse gas allowances and in some other items, but the biggest driver was a $91 million movement in greenhouse gas allowances. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So it wasn't an income item. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Good afternoon. On SoCalGas just so I understand the seasonality here. Is the way to think about this is that the operating costs and D&A is going to be roughly straight-lined across the year, but that revenue and cost to goods is going to be sort of variable with the amount of gas being sold into the utility system? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'm going to have Dennis kind of walk you through this again. And I think it would be helpful if you kind of looked at what really happens with the seasonality adjustment. The important thing is that at the end of the year, everything should even out from historical years. It's just in between the periods of time and how this follows our cash flow and how it follows our balancing accounts and all of that. So I'll have Dennis kind of walk you through that to help everyone understand it a bit. Dennis? Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.: Yeah. Faisel, I think the two key takeaways as Debbie mentioned are : at the end of the year, there is no impact to earnings; and at the end of the year, there is no impact to cash flow. But if you look at based on your question, what's happening is we are now starting from a GAAP perspective recording the core margin revenues so that they reflect more the actual activity in our business. What's happened is, historically, if you looked at we've flatlined it 1/12 (40:09) every month across the \u2013 every month on an annual basis. Now we're \u2013 you can see that for the first quarter about 56% of our overall earnings are in the first quarter. And you'll see the vast majority of the earnings in the fourth quarter. What does end up happening is relative to GAAP, whatever expenses we have every quarter, will continue to be recorded in those quarters. So you're not going to see a huge change in our expenses on a quarter-to-quarter basis versus what we've had historically. But what you will see is the higher earnings in the first and fourth quarters which obviously \u2013 on the core margin which will lead to higher revenues. From a balancing account perspective, you will see some changes there but again, no changes to full-year earnings and no changes to cash flow. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : And our expenses are recorded at actual for the quarter just to be clear. Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.: That's right. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : We've always recorded our expenses at actual for the quarter, so those were never normalized. Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.: That's Right. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : What was normalized was the revenue side of it. So this changes the revenue to really reflect how we're collecting it from customers. Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.: And it's consistent with what we've been doing for our non-core earnings and how we've actually been recording for SDG&E all along. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got you. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Did that answer your question, Faisel? I just want to be sure because I... Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : (41:31). Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, totally. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Thanks. And then next question on SDG&E, just with the introduction of the sort of battery technology or battery products from Tesla, yeah, how does this impact sort of the SDG&E utility? I mean, do you expect this to result to sort of more people wanting to get off the grid or just to kind of a broader sort of view on how you're looking at this technology and the impact to the utility? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me have Jeff address that because we have done so much work in this area. And in fact, SDG&E is kind of the leader in terms of having the most electric vehicles and all in the country. So I think it would be helpful to have Jeff address this. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Chief Executive Officer & Director, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.: Good morning, Faisel. Certainly, some of the announcements you've been seeing around batteries, and most recently in this last week, is there are interesting announcements. I think the key thing that I always like people to remember is that, a little bit over a year ago the state approved a procurement process for the California Utilities where we would procure just over 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage. You have to recall that's all targeted for grid level storage. That's in between the point of central station production through the transmission grid down to the substation in your respective service territories. That opportunity for SDG&E is about 165 megawatts. And when you think about energy storage, we think it will follow a similar path to other technologies like solar. So you think about all of the purchases of solar in Europe at the central station level, as manufacturing capacity expanded around the world, you saw more of that start making a migration toward the residential side. So I think you'll see central applications will be the first mover for batteries. But with respect to the residential, obviously there is a lot of hype around this, but I mean our perspective is a little bit different and it's because of the rate mechanism and how billing occurs in California. So if you are a rooftop solar customer in SDG&E's territory, as you produce electricity, it goes to offset your bundled rate in the month that it occurs. And if you have excess production in that month, it rolls forward to the next month. So in essence, the way the rate mechanism worked in California, you're getting free battery service every month. You're not paying for it, right? So at all times, whatever you produce is offsetting the bundled rate. And that's really the goal of any type of residential application, is to ensure that you can always use it for your bundled service rather than selling it back, at some type of marginal costs. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Chief Executive Officer & Director, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.: So we think it's an exciting area. We think you'll see more on the residential side. But right now, the PUC's goal is to get to 1.3 gigawatts online by 2024. That gives you some timeline about how people are thinking about the central station side of it. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Understood. And then just on the Renewable side, the \u2013 I think I missed this, the Black Oak Getty wind project. How much did you guys pay for that asset? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : We don't generally talk about how much we pay for assets but it was de minimis, because it's an early development project. We will have about, when it's fully built, approximately $145 million, $150 million of capital in it when it's fully built. But it's just in the early stage development. So we will be doing all the build-out and all. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And last question from me. Do you guys have any outlook on the storage environment, gas storage environment? Are you seeing any sort of recovery in the business? Are we still looking at sort of $0.02 a month in sort of storage pricing? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'll have Mark talk about that because there are some things that are looking up in that area. And so Mark, do you want to -? Mark Alan Snell - President: Yeah. I would say that it's \u2013 I think we're seeing things that are slightly better than what you're talking about on a spot basis, and then on a term basis we're seeing much better rates. So that's all pretty positive. It's still a very low-priced environment for storage compared to what it was a few years ago, but I would say it's definitely kind of improving, albeit that it's been slow and a little bit sporadic. But it does definitely seem to be on an uptrend. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Dandurand with Goldman Sachs. Michael Dandurand - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and thanks for the question. Most of them have actually been answered, but one, I just wanted to follow-up on the gas storage actually and more related to LNG opportunities. So Mark, if you could just touch on what you're thinking about there as kind of the ramp-up in LNG facilities coming online in the Gulf Coast. Mark Alan Snell - President: That's a great question. Obviously, we believe and others now are starting to see the opportunity for storage in the Gulf, but that is directly tied to LNG facilities. And the difference between this type of storage and say others would be that these storage facilities that will service these facilities will have a lot more compression so that their injection rates are a lot higher than a typical storage facility. And we are currently working with a couple customers right now on our Louisiana storage facility, and we hope to be able to talk about that more in the near-term. But it looks exciting; it looks like we may have something there to talk about later. Michael Dandurand - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. So that near-term being within the next year or something like that? Mark Alan Snell - President: Before year-end. Yeah, sometime in the fourth quarter. Michael Dandurand - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. That's all I have. Congrats, again. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Just to clarify on the tax rate on the TRV, so we still don't know exactly what the tax rate would be on distributions to Sempra. But in theory, it should be less than the marginal tax rate because it's got some kind of shield depreciation \u2013 shield? Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, sir. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : So the short answer is, yes. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. And then secondly, Debbie, you mentioned after at some point soon, you'll commence settlement discussions in your rate case. Does that \u2013 any indication of just you may be feeling better about, chances of settling this case and maybe the last one or is it just more normal process? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think a couple of things, as we've talked before, our filings were pretty vanilla. And they really focused on safety issues and reliability issues and dollars needed for that at our utilities. And it wasn't about a lot of new programs or activities. So I think and then looking at the ORA report that came out, the issues that they raised on their report are issues \u2013 I've been here 37 years now, I've seen those issues for 37 years. So it's like nothing unusual in their report and so I think that that is a fertile ground for settlement when you have that type of \u2013 at least you're not talking about being having a lack of common interest. Clearly, the parties are interested in safety and investing in safety as a system. So we're hopeful that we could try to reach some settlement with some of the parties. We have not yet seen the other intervener testimony. That will be coming in sometime the middle of May. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Winfried Fruehauf with W. Fruehauf Consulting Limited (49:35). Unknown Speaker : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Other than the $113 million of seasonality adjustment, were there any other income items that relates to different periods, but were recorded in the first quarter of this year? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, the $113 million is the seasonality. I wasn't clear if you said $113 million, but it's $113 million. And then the SONGS issue, which we took out in adjusted earnings, was really kind of a reconciliation of all of the settlement that was reached on SONGS and what the tax treatments and all ended up being on that. So that when we took out it in our adjusted earnings that we gave you. And I would ask Trevor or Joe if there is anything else that they would see in there. Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller: Yeah. The only other thing would be the item that Dennis had mentioned, was the GCIM, which was related to the prior year, but awarded in the current year. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And that's a... Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : That's a rolling... Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller: Yeah. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And that's a rolling thing. Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.: We ordinarily get a GCIM award. Last year, we got it in the third quarter, and this year, we got in the first. But it's... Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller: Right. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : So we get it every year. Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.: Yeah. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : So it's not a... Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : It's not a one-time. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : It's not a prior period. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And I did want to be clear on the $113 million. That is all this year's revenue. It has nothing to do with any other year. It just all happens to be coming in the first quarters and fourth quarters, for the most part. Unknown Speaker : Yeah. Thanks. I understand. I have one other little question. What was for the quarter the foreign exchange impact given the strength of the U.S. dollar in that quarter versus foreign currencies? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Joe? Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Thanks. Almost nothing. We had some impact in Chile and Peru, but it was essentially just reducing the growth in the earnings in the two businesses. And maybe it was around $4 million, but it was completely offset by FX gains in Mexico, about $5 million. So the net impact of the whole business is negligible. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thanks very much. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ashar Khan with Visium (51:46). Unknown Speaker : My questions have been answered. Debbie, just on what you said that you expect the PLR in a reasonable period, I'm expecting it's \u2013 that would imply sometime during the summer. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry. I couldn't hear your question. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : The PLR. Would we get it in the summer? Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : It's \u2013 I'm sorry, the? Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : The Private Letter Ruling. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. The Private Letter Ruling. Yeah. It's all \u2013 can I tell you when IRS is going to do, something that's really hard. I would tell you that what I hear from our people is that there doesn't seem to be issues, and that it's not a matter that there is a problem. It's just the matter of them getting their work done and issuing the ruling, and so that's the best I can tell you. Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We think it's in final stages. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go to our final question from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Hi. Just a quick follow-up. So just once you get the PLR and you get the other housekeeping issues done, whether it's with your JV partners or whatever else may it be, at that point, whenever that may be, that, I guess, sort of we'll hear from you. It doesn't need to be on a quarterly basis, I guess. It's kind of when you're ready to go... Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me just... Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : ...we'll hear from you. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me just \u2013 I mean, we will have to make a decision about moving forward when all of this work is done. And then when our board makes a decision as to whether we move forward, then the next step would be filing a press release. And then after the press release, there would be a period of time and then the S-1 filing would be made. And so that's what I think you can look for. It doesn't have to be an announcement on a quarter. It just needs to be when our board has made a decision as to whether or not we would move forward. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions in our queue, so I'll turn the call back over to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks. Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you all for joining us today. Actually, you had a lot of great questions. And if you have more, which I'm sure you will, please don't hesitate to call our Investor Relations team, and thank you for joining us today. Operator : That does conclude our conference today. We thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead. Richard Vaccari : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's second quarter 2015 financial presentation. A live webcast to this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today are several members of our management team : Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas; Steve Davis, President of SDG&E and Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, President of Sempra LNG. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 4, 2015, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Mark. Mark Snell : Thanks, Rick. To start off, I want to mention that Debbie is not joining us today. She had a medical issue with her left eye that required attention and treatment this morning. She apologizes for not being able to make the call, but we all realized health issues come first. I'll be filling in for her today. And so now, we'll get on with the call. Our financial performance for the second quarter was very strong. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $260 million or $1.03 per share. As you may recall, these figures include the impact from applying seasonality to the SoCalGas revenues in 2015. While this change does not affect full-year earnings for SoCalGas that results in almost all of their earnings being reported in the first quarter and fourth quarter of the year. Specifically, the impact from seasonality was $48 million of lower earnings this quarter, and $65 million of higher earnings year-to-date. Given our solid financial results in both the first quarter and second quarter, we are on track to achieve our 2015 adjusted earning guidance. Today, I'd also like to emphasize that just six months into the first year of our current five-year plan, we have already secured by new projects that are additional to the base plan we presented at the March Analyst Conference. At U.S. gas and power, we have added two new solar projects at our Mesquite facility in Arizona, this adds to the Black Oak Getty wind project we announced last quarter. In Mexico, IEnova was awarded another CFE pipeline project in July. And last week, IEnova agreed to purchase PEMEX's 50% equity interest in IEnova-PEMEX joint venture. In addition, we're working on the steps needed to advance our potential LNG projects, which could extend growth beyond 2019. And our California utilities have made headway on the GRC and rate reform initiatives. We are all really pleased, with our progress, and will discuss our development projects in more detail as we proceed. First, let me begin with a regulatory and operational update, including a discussion of our progress in achieving our base plan. Please turn to slide five. Our California utilities are making steady progress on their general rate case applications. Since our last call, we have completed evidentiary hearings, and are well situated to receive a timely decision. Briefs are due in August and September with the draft decision scheduled for year end. After participating in the hearing process, we believe our recommendations make a compelling case in support of the state\u2019s priorities around safety and reliability. Please turn to slide six. Turning to one of FDG&Es highest priorities, the CPUC approved a final decision on rate reform in July. The decision implements electric rates that are more fair and sustainable. We provide a summary in the appendix, but key outcomes of the decision include, a reduction in the number of tiers, from four down to two, and annual reduction and rate differentials between the lowest and highest tiers, minimum monthly bills and a process to study and implement time of use rates. The decision directs all the state\u2019s electric utilities to implement initial changes, no later than November 1, 2015. Yesterday, net energy metering tariff proposals were also filed by all parties. Once approved the tariffs will determine how customers with new distributed energy resources will pay for utility services they received. FDG&E's suggested tariffs would apply to all new net energy metering customers by 2017. Though we expect a final decision by year-end, it could extend into the next year. Let's now go to slide seven for an update on base plant projects and our other businesses. We're really executing well on our five-year plan. Since our last earnings call, two more projects are in service. In Mexico, the 155 megawatt ESJ wind project reached commercial operations in June and in the U.S. 1.2 Bcf per day of east-to-west capacity on the REX pipeline, was placed into service over this last weekend. In addition, we closed the sale of the remaining block of the Mesquite power plant in the second quarter. We received $347 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $36 million after tax gain on the sale. As discussed last quarter, this gain is not included in our 2015 adjusted earning guidance. Please turn to slide eight for update on our development opportunities. We're pleased to announce that we have secured several development opportunities this quarter that are additional to our base plan. In Mexico, IEnova was awarded a new CFE pipeline project in July. The project represents an investment of about $110 million and is expected to be in operations in the first half of 2017. CFE has announced two more pipelines will be awarded in August and September, one of which interconnects with the pipeline we just won. Five more pipelines are scheduled to be awarded later this year. You can refer to the table in the appendix for details. In addition, on Friday, we announced the IEnova has agreed to purchase PEMEX's 50% equity interest in their shared joint venture. The transaction is expected to close later this year. As noted in our recent press release, IEnova agreed to purchase the business for approximately $1.3 billion subject to certain terms and conditions. IEnova and PEMEX will also maintain a 50/50 JV for the continued joint development of the Los Ramones Norte pipeline and other future infrastructure projects. As a result of the transaction, IEnova will own 100% of six purchased assets, five of which are currently in operation. The assets are covered by long-term dollar-based contracts. The acquisition is expected to be about $0.05 accretive to Sempra Energy's earnings in 2016 growing to about $0.10 per share by 2019. IEnova expects to finance the purchase with a combination of equity and debt. The acquisition provides several important benefits and ongoing relationship with PEMEX for future development projects, opportunities for asset optimization and expansion into areas such as the transportation and storage of refined products, and a larger platform of presence in Mexico to participate in the energy sector reform. Moving to U.S. Gas & Power. We are pleased to announce contracts on two new renewable projects that are Mesquite Solar facility in Arizona. Mesquite Solar 2 will be a 100-megawatt project secured by a 20-year PPA. Mesquite Solar 3 will be a 150-megawatt project secured by a 25-year PPA, both PPAs are with creditworthy counterparties and we expect the projects to be in service by the end of 2016. And finally, I will note that we are working diligently to prepare our S-1 filing for Sempra Partners. Securities laws, however, prohibit us from discussing the matter further. Let's now go to slide nine for a discussion of our LNG development process. LNG development continues to be a terrific long-term growth opportunity with very large potential for upside for Sempra. While the development process takes time and can vary between projects, we are making solid progress on all three of our liquefaction initiatives. Since LNG development continues to be a hot topic for investors, we provided this slide to illustrate the process needed to advance the project to FID or final investment decision. Cameron Expansion is the project that is furthest along, so we use that project as an example. But before walking you through the slide, I want to reiterate a couple of key themes. First, while projections for global LNG demand are lower than a few years ago, industry forecast continue to show large un-contracted demand post 2019. These forecasts already include competing sources of supply such as the restart of some of Japan's nuclear fleet, more coal and renewable development in Asia, growing pipeline imports into customer markets and indigenous shale gas sales. Second, U.S. Gulf LNG projects are regarded as the most competitive source of global supply, both in cost and in flexibility. And third, we are receiving strong interest in our projects from large buyers of LNG for delivery in the 2019 and beyond timeframes. Now moving to the graphic on this slide, we have illustrated key work streams related to project cost and design permitting, marketing and financing. You'll notice that each category is interrelated. EPC project cost estimates and lenders' consents are needed in order to finalize customer contracts, agreements with customers on tariffs and service dates and quantities are needed to finalize financing commitments. In financing terms, the regulatory approvals are needed to make the final investment decision. Completion of each of these work streams is what enables us to take a project to achieve FID. For Cameron expansion, we're targeting FID in late 2016. Our Cameron joint venture is currently permitting trains four and five, but the project could begin with one or two trains depending on total market interest. Cameron expansion is well positioned as one of the lowest cost sources of global LNG supply. This is due to the economies of scale and adding more trains to an existing facility, the opportunity to benefit from continuous construction at the site, a simpler permitting process, an access to low-cost of capital and of course in expense of North American Gas. Moving to other LNG development projects, we continue to actively develop the Port Arthur project and have submitted the initial filings at both DOE and FERC. Market interest in this project remains strong as it offers different off take and ownership opportunities from those available at Cameron. In June, we also announced an MOU with Woodside Petroleum to work on the feasibility of developing the project together. For ECA we are working with the Mexican government in the development of all the regulations and conditions needed to support liquefaction and export of LNG from Mexico. We have completed a large - we have completed a number of studies on technical feasibility and market interest for this sole west coast Brownfield site. Together with PEMEX, we continue to advance the development work and are now sharing costs. Now with that let's turn to slide 10, for a discussion of the quarterly earnings. Joe? Joe Householder : Thank you, Mark. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $295 million or $1.17 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported second quarter earnings of $260 million or $1.03 per share. Second quarter earnings in 2014 were $269 million or $1.08 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude two items first we recorded a $36 million after-tax gain on the sale of the remaining block of the Mesquite Power Plant. Second as I noted last quarter, we are adjusting earnings for expenses relating to the development of our pre-proposed LNG liquefaction projects. While our cash expenditures have been consistent with cost for the LNG development activities, we've undertaken thus far we have recorded $1 million of after-tax expense in the second quarter of 2015. This number reflects the fact that certain costs are being capitalized and certain other costs are being shared with our Cameron joint venture partners and PEMEX. I also wanted to note that compared with the same period of last year, second quarter earnings now reflect the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas revenues. As Mark mentioned earlier, this impact resulted in $48 million of lower earnings this quarter and $65 million of higher earnings year-to-date. Looking to the third quarter please be aware that we could report a loss for SoCalGas due to seasonality. You can refer to the appendix for additional detail where we illustrate 2014 SoCalGas earnings at seasonality and revenues been applied. As the appendix shows third quarter 2014 earnings would have reflected a loss in the third quarter. So there was no impact on a full year basis. Overall, we are on track to achieving our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance given the strong financial performance we've had year-to-date. Finally, before proceeding, I want to mention that we expect to report a one-time non-cash gain next quarter, we will step up our investment to fair value related to IEnova's purchase of PEMEX's interest in their joint venture. The size of the gain has not yet been determined and is not included in our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance. Please turn to slide 11. Individual financial results for each of our businesses could be found in this section of our presentation entitled business unit earnings. I'll address here the key drivers for our consolidated earnings this quarter. Sempra International recorded $19 million of higher earnings primarily from the Los Ramones I pipeline and a section of the Sonora pipeline in Mexico that are now in service. SoCalGas recorded a $13 million retroactive benefit for 2012 to the first quarter of 2015 from higher rate base. Approval of this benefit by the PUC was contingent upon receiving a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the IRS which we received in April. SoCalGas also had $10 million of higher operational earnings from higher CPUC margins net of operating expenses and higher AFUDC equity earnings. Offsetting these positive factors were two items, the $48 million seasonality impact that lowered SoCalGas's 2015 earnings and $11 million of lower net investment earnings at the parent on assets in support of our retirement obligations. Now let's conclude with slide 12. Overall, our financial and operating results for the second quarter continued to be very strong and consistent with our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Excluding the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas's revenues, our second quarter adjusted earnings increased significantly compared to the same period last year driven largely by increased operating results at both Sempra International and SoCalGas. Across the company, we have made excellent progress on our base plan and continue to capture additional development opportunities. As we look forward to the remainder of the year we are working diligently to capture more development opportunities that can provide upside to our base plan in the near term. In addition, we'll continue to work toward advancing our LNG projects that could extend this growth beyond 2019. With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Weinstein with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon. Joe Householder : Hi, Mike. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: It's Julien here. Joe Householder : Hey Julien, how are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, not too bad. Thank you. I suppose first question here out of the gates, obviously the IEnova is a pleasant development but curious, you're providing a bridge loan but ultimately how are you thinking about your ownership stake in IEnova pro forma for the latest deal, but probably more strategically, how are you thinking about that down the line as you think about the 80%-ish you're on today? Mark Snell : Well, I'm going to let Joe handle that question in detail, but let me just say off the bat that we are expecting to finance this at the IEnova level and even if we don't participate in this thing and I'll let Joe explain what we're thinking there but even if we didn't, it would still be accretive to us but Joe why don't you give some more details on that. Joe Householder : Yeah. Thanks, Mark and hi Julien. Yeah, this is very important and we're studying the issue. We really like this deal and so we would like to participate in the deal. We are looking at, what the market is going to be like over the next couple of months. We've got a lot of confidence from the banks we've worked with on this transaction. And I think our current view is, we will participate in the equity offering. We know that a number of our IEnova investors want to have more liquidity. So, we've said all along that if we have a large project this would enable us to go back out to the equity markets. And so we're going to have an equity offering I believe, we will participate. What I'm currently thinking is, we have a dividend coming later this week from IEnova. It will come to our Mexican Holding company. And I think, we'll use that cash plus some other cash to participate in the offering. We haven't decided the firm amount yet, we want to see how the shares are doing and how the market is, but we definitely will participate, and as Mark said, this is going to be accretive either way. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Excellent. Turning to the LNG story. Curious, you mentioned on the slides here for instance one trains or two trains at Cameron. I suppose, as it relates to the project, what's your confidence level, as it relates to one trains or two trains? And, then secondly, in terms of conversations, are you still expecting that you passively acknowledge to the Street one way or another perhaps by 4Q or 1Q next year a decision. I mean, I know, you indicate FID by second half of 2016, but just wanted to be very clear about your communication intentions? Mark Snell : Well, with respect to trains four and trains five, we have this partnership that owns a facility, we own 50% and our partners own the other 50%. Currently through trains one, trains two, trains three our partners have all of the capacity. With respect to trains four and trains five, we have a right, Sempra has the right to 50% of that capacity, we're highly confident that we're going to be able to market that capacity and we're actively doing that now. And therefore we know that at least one of the trains will go, whether our partners decide to market that extra capacity or not is entirely up to them and we don't control that, but - Oct\u00e1vio, if you would like to comment on any of that that maybe fill in. Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es : Sure. I think Mark covered the big topics and that is that the ownership has decided to go forward with the expansion. We have 50% of that expansion capacity roughly 4 million tons, the remaining partners have 4 million tons as well. What they're doing with their capacity, it depends whether they want to put it in the market, if it fits in their portfolio or not, we are actively pursuing it, we're encouraged by all the things we are finding in our current negotiations. And so at the end of the day, I think the slide reflects that we'll go back and say, okay, Sempra is taking on the 4 million tons that we are allotted to, if our partners say no that means that probably then one just one train will be built since there was agreement by everybody, if they market their capacity then we would have the two trains. We are permitting both trains from both the FERC and DOE. Mark Snell : I'd add on Mark. Just to be clear, so everybody is clear on the call. The fourth train would be owned by the joint venture, so it'd be 50-50 ownership. But Oct\u00e1vio was right, we would have the capacity. Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es : That's right, Joe. Mark Snell : Okay. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just to be extra clear about this, I apologize. So this would be - you would obviously still need to go and remarket your respective ownership, but I supposed at this point in time you're indicating that you intend at least move forward on train 4, is that an incremental? Mark Snell : Yeah, what we would - I mean obviously we would not move forward if we haven't sold the capacity forward, but we're in the process of that marketing effort right now and we're pretty confident that we'll get that done. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Thank you. I'll let it be. Operator : And we will take our next question from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering. Neel Mitra : Hi. Good afternoon. Mark Snell : Hi, Neel. Neel Mitra : A question on the PEMEX acquisition. Now that you have a larger stake in Mexico, especially with the pipes, are you seeing additional synergies or lateral opportunities from owning a larger stake in Mexico? Mark Snell : Yes, I mean, in fact we're seeing two things. One, on the cost side, with us acquiring a 100% of the pipes that we're in the JV. We believe we can integrate those with the other pipes that we own and we'll definitely get some synergies out of that that would be in addition to the earnings accretion that we've so far forecasted. So we think if there is additional upside just in the operational synergies that we can achieve. But then secondly, all of the pipeline infrastructure that we're building now, we've to this point, only marketed it to the original customer that ask for it to be built mainly CFE or PEMEX. But these are open access pipes and we are announced - into market extra capacity to other users and we've just actually started working on that and we're seeing some success and getting that. So we do think there is additional upside to come from marketing additional capacity either that exist currently or that we can create through compression and we are pretty excited about that. We think that there is a growth opportunity there. Neel Mitra : And what would be the timeline for recognizing some of the possible lateral projects? When can we first hear about it? Joe Householder : Well, I guess, you'll first hear about it when they are announced, but for the most part, I think we're working on some of these right now and some will be probably completed before year-end. Neel Mitra : Okay. Great. And Joe you had two good quarters. Can you say where you are within the guidance range at this point? Are you at the high end or are you in the middle? Can you comment on that? Joe Householder : We are not going to narrow the range or talk about where we are in the guidance. You can see the year-to-date results are really strong, you can't double those because SoCalGas is $65 million ahead on the seasonality. So that will come back and then we have a few items that are in the earnings year-to-date that won't repeat. So we feel really good about where we are, but we're not going to narrow it at this point. Neel Mitra : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Yeah, hi. I've got a few questions. First, on the two new solar projects. Can you give us any sense of the earnings benefit to those? Mark Snell : We are not disclosing the benefits precisely, but they're 100 megawatts and 150 megawatts projects and there are consistent returns with what we've had in the past. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then secondly just on the MLP, which I know you can't talk about. Can you just remind when we did - when you did your base plan, my recollection is that you did not kind of assume the MLP in your financing plan. Mark Snell : That's correct. Steven Fleishman : At your Analyst Day. Mark Snell : That's correct. Steven Fleishman : Is that correct? Mark Snell : That's correct. Joe Householder : Yeah. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And just is there any way to give any color on kind of how to think about that strategy just given current market conditions? Joe Householder : The thing is we just cannot comment on the MLP at all. I just - I apologize, but that just the way the rules are and so we really can't talk about it. We'll talk about that when we do the marketing for the MLP. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And I get that. And then finally just back that you know of the $0.05 to $0.10 of accretion on the different years, that's whether you take stock or not, are related to this deal, that range is still pretty good either way, sort of the equation. Mark Snell : Yes. I'll let Joe. Joe Householder : Yes. It's pretty close. I mean we've evaluated this as we've been working on this deal for a few months and actually whether we borrow money or whether we issue equity, it hardly has any impact and so the only thing that moves jut slightly is whether we participate but again it's going to be accretive either way, but I think we will - you will see us participate to some degree. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then one question on Cameron 4 and Cameron 5. So you can control of 4 million tons of one train. You're only going to go forward with yours if you sign long-term contracts, I assume. Joe Householder : Correct. Steven Fleishman : Okay. The partners have this other 4 million tons, can you - is there any way that if you kind of see the market that you could kind of take that over as well if you wanted to or is it really in their hands what to do with that? Joe Householder : It's really in their hands. I mean I suppose something could be worked out but we have other projects too that we're developing and are part of our portfolio. So we have to evaluate it in relation to those just as they will. Steven Fleishman : Okay. But it sounds like your conviction on moving forward what you control seems quite high. Joe Householder : I think you could say that it is very high, yes. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : Hey, guys. Steve just asked my question, so I'm good. Thanks. Mark Snell : Okay. Thanks, Greg. Joe Householder : Thanks, Greg. Operator : And we will go next to Michael Dandurand with Goldman Sachs. Michael Dandurand : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Mark Snell : Hi, Michael. Joe Householder : Hi. Michael Dandurand : Just to - and first of all thank -appreciate the additional color on LNG, and with particular to Cameron. I just have a follow-up there as it relates to the Port Arthur. Can you just talk a little bit about what we should be looking forward there and how things are going with Woodside now involved? Mark Snell : Well, I'll start and then I'll let Oct\u00e1vio comment on this as well, but we have an MOU with Woodside to look at the feasibility of the project. We're progressing on it. We've had lots of meetings. We're starting some of the technical analysis and starting some of the marketing of the trains. It's an excellent site. It looks like it's very promising as moving forward and I would say their commitment to it is very strong. And Oct\u00e1vio, do you want to give any other color on that? Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es : I think you've covered the process. I would just add part of the attractiveness of Port Arthur is that it appeals to customers that may want to have equity as part of their supply strategy. It allows us and Woodside to look at options to really make Port Arthur a very low cost supplier in the LNG market, which for us is key for the success of any project out of the U.S. exports of LNG. So it's - plus this is going extremely well. There is a lot of similar objectives between us Woodside, and you're likely to see some announcements as that relationship grows and as the project continues to go forward. Joe Householder : Yeah. And I would just add to that. I think it's important just to keep in mind that our projects, both in the Gulf and ECO as well, we are positioning them as at the very low end of the cost curve for LNG worldwide. And so we think they will be very competitive, but that doesn't - we have other Gulf Coast facilities that obviously compete with that. But in general, our facilities and the others in the Gulf region in particular, are some of the lowest cost providers of LNG that out there. And therefore they're very likely to get lifted over time. Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es : Mike, if I may just add. One of the key elements for any buyer of LNG in the world is the reliability and the creditability of the developer. And so, we think Sempra is very well positioned with our track record, clearly Woodside is very well positioned given their track record. And so that in itself is an advantage because we'll be offering technology that's conventional that the buyers are used, that's reliable and with all kinds of the guarantees that they expect from a project of this size. Michael Dandurand : Got it. It's very helpful. So, in less of an emphasis on the spot market, if I'm hearing that correctly? Mark Snell : Yes. Michael Dandurand : Got it. And then just as far as, we've seen a bit of a deterioration in the midstream arena, and I appreciate that you can't discuss the MLP directly. But just as far as the broader landscape for midstream assets out there. Are you seeing anything more attractive just from an M&A standpoint. Mark Snell : Well, obviously we do see some attractive M&A opportunities. We just executed on one last week. So we think that - we think that we did a very good deal last weekend and we're really happy with it. So obviously with the way the landscape has been, it could be that M&A opportunities become more viable. But it's still - there still a pretty good cost advantage to developing your own projects as opposed to train to buy them in the marketplace. We see that both - we see that both in the midstream area and also in the renewables area as well, to the extent that we continue to develop our own backlog of projects, that's a much more profitable avenue for us and we're fortunate to have a pretty good backlog of projects to work on. So I think we're very well positioned for growth and growth at the lower end of the cost curve as opposed to somebody that's trying to it through acquisition. Michael Dandurand : Got it. Very helpful. I mean the only other one I have is just on Mexico with the recent project win there. Does that help your upcoming bid with the project in August here, I'm going to put you this name, the Samalayuca. Joe Householder : Yeah, it does. We believe the project that we just won is kind of a large header system, which will benefit us and being able to control the costs on the next project bid that's coming up. And so I don't want to go into all the details of why that is. But we do think it gives us a little bit of an advantage and we're hoping to see some success there. Michael Dandurand : Okay. Got it. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Joe Householder : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Matt Tucker : Hey, guys. Congrats on nice quarter and on the IEnova transaction. I just wanted to ask about that. PEMEX and IEnova highlighted the remaining JV as a platform for future product development. Just talk about little bit the opportunities you see going forward with PEMEX. And also is this model - something you could see PEMEX wanting to repeat i.e. develop and construct their project in a JV and then sell their interest? Mark Snell : Yeah, look, I think it's a healthy development for us in the sense that PEMEX is recognizing this transaction. They repeatedly refer to it as a monetization as opposed to a sale, because they see this opportunity to build these projects that they need to have done and then once they're built, they can monetize them through a sale to us and then start on the next project and we see that or obviously we think that that's a very exciting opportunity for us. And we were very happy that they wanted to stay into this partnership arrangement with the pipeline that's currently under construction and then the considered new projects in that. So I think we do think - we are looking at this as a source of future projects. We think it's a good model for us, it's worked well in the past. And I think the thing that that PEMEX appreciates is that they have now worked with us on these projects over the years. They've had good results, we've built good projects, they've come in pretty much on time and on budget and I think they see us as a really good partner that they can count on to deliver for them. And so that's something that we - obviously we pride ourselves on and we think that is going to lead to more projects in the future. Joe Householder : Mark, I'd add on to that. And, Matt, I think you guys don't always see this, but Mark and I sit on the IEnova board and so we were just down there last week and we were with Debbie and we met with PEMEX and other government agencies. And it's really important, we have a very interactive ongoing relationship with IEnova. And I just want to make sure you guys all understand that. Matt Tucker : Okay, great. And just on the California facilities, the GRCs mentioned they're going well. Can you just update us on any kind of key or contentious issues that are emerging as the process goes on. And I believe at the Analyst Day when you came out your longer term guidance, you had assumed no rate increase resulting from the GRCs, any update on how you're thinking about that assumption? Joe Householder : Yeah, I'm going to turn this over to Dennis to give you the details. So let me just make one quick point which is - at the analyst conference and in the plan, what we assumed with respect to the GRC was just normal attrition, but I think that was just a conservative assumption to - for the planning purposes, but I think Dennis can give you some more detail on that. Dennis Arriola : Thanks, Mark. Hi, Matt. Yeah, as Mark said in his opening comments. Things are going well. We finished our evidentiary hearings two days ahead of schedule and we're happy with the overall pace of the filings. Our witnesses from both SoCalGas and SDG&E did a great job of explaining the overall merits and details of both of our filings. And we're really optimistic that we're going to receive constructive decisions for both companies. We can't obviously disclose anything related to any settlement discussions if we're in them. But what we can tell you, is given the strong show in that we had in our evidentiary hearings and the fact that, our filings are consistent with the priorities of the PUC which are around safety, reliability and customer service. We feel really good about potential constructive discussions with intervening parties. As it pertains to the plan that Mark talked about, you're right, what we just assumed was that, our existing attrition rates of 2.75% for both SoCalGas and SDG&E, would continue from a planning perspective but obviously we've asked for more that supports our filings. And, so far, the ORA in their reply have come back and said that, they would be looking for 3.5% attrition increases in 2017 and 2018 or both SoCalGas and SDG&E. So, having said all that, we feel really good about where we're at this point. Matt Tucker : Great. Mark Snell : Steven, do you have any comment on that? Steve Davis : No, I really have nothing more to add. But, again as Dennis pointed out, we concluded our regulatory hearings and we feel very confident in the outcome of those hearings and we look forward to construct a dialogue with parties going forward. Matt Tucker : All right. Thanks. And, then just one on the LNG side, I thought it was great that you can have the visibility to target the FID on the Cameron expansion. Any sense you can gives us for - do you have targets yet for FIDs on ECA or Port Arthur or can you give us a sense for maybe how far behind they are right now? Mark Snell : I'll let [ph] Trevor address that. Trevor Mihalik : Sure. Port Arthur we're probably looking at something in the late 2017, late 2018 timeframe for FID. It does take - it does require a different permitting process, it's environmental impact same as opposed to environmental assessment which takes longer. And obviously we don't have the benefit or the luxury of just a continuation of the existing EPC contract and contractor at Cameron. So that will process with a limitation to bid and what not, will take longer. So late 2017, 2018 timeframe is what we're thinking about Port Arthur. For Costa Azul as we're putting all the key elements in place from regulatory standpoint and from a commercial standpoint that might be a little later than that or at the same timeframe frankly on that one, I'm not confident enough at this point to make a prognostic as to the FID timeframe. One of the things with respect to ECA is a lot of the regulations are still being developed. So we're not really sure exactly how to go about that process. I mean we've been working with the Mexican government on developing the regulations for LNG exports. So we're still - so to give you a firm date would be really quite difficult, but it is probably more in the Port Arthur timeframe than it is in the trains four and five timeframe. Matt Tucker : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks again. Trevor Mihalik : Okay. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Mark Snell : Hey, Faisel. Faisel Khan : Hey, good afternoon. Just on the PEMEX, the accretion you guys discussed in your slide from $0.05 to $0.10. So, I guess all I've got so far in that JV is in terms of projects that you're working on are expanding with a JV is the ethane pipeline. So what else is going to sort of drive that joint venture from $0.05 to $0.10? I'm assuming loss from [indiscernible]. That's still in the JV and the same ownership presenters so that doesn't change anything that's going on there. Well, I will let Joe address the EPS numbers. Joe Householder : Hey, Faisel. So, most of it is the ethane project coming online but then in addition to that Mark talked a little bit about some of the synergies that we see and in an addition all the cash flow from the business would be accumulating and paying down debt or being available to provide some earnings and that's what's really driving the few cents additional as we go through the time period, but the bulk of it is ethane. Faisel Khan : Okay. That's a pretty big uptick in earnings just from the ethane project. What's the stats of these lines in the JV, are they running at full capacity or are they - is there a room to grow that having to spend much capital? Joe Householder : Yeah, actually as I mentioned earlier there's two things that we really didn't put into the EPS guidance, one was the efficiencies that we think we can get from running a whole system together, that's one. And then the two, there is either additional capacity in the lines or capacity that could be added relatively and expensively with compression and we're in the process of marketing some of that capacity to other users. So, other LDCs, power plants and those kinds of things and so we do think that there is upside there. We haven't put that - we haven't calculated that into our EPS estimates of accretion, but there is certainly other things that we think we can get. Faisel Khan : Okay, got it. Makes sense. And then just on Port Arthur so the sort of relationship here are talking about with the Woodside Petroleum. So, I guess what's the timeline in terms of when you guys decide whether you're going to go forward with the joint venture and I guess therefore market the asset together or what are you guys thinking about it right now. What is the... Joe Householder : Well, we're actually starting - we are marketing the asset right now, but I'll let Trevor give a little more detail. Trevor Mihalik : Yeah. Let me be clear, on the marketing side of the asset clearly, we would not have engaged and pursued if we didn't find the interest so it's expert oriented. As we look through what the project now will be structured, then if it is with [indiscernible] side which obviously we hope and are confident it will be, then we together will have to develop the marketing strategy for the asset. So, that's on the marketing side. As far as, what we expect to see going forward, it's really going to be a continuation of the same process. We're looking at the feasibility. We're looking at the economics. There are hurdles that we will have to go through to make sure we go to the next stage. Are we confident we can put together a project that's low cost as it has to be? Are we confident that we can do all of the regulatory permits in all of the local issues we have to deal with? So, those things will be a hurdle that, we will be overcoming. We're confident we can, but it's tough to give you a timeframe at this point it's very specific. I think, you will see some developments between now and at the end of the year, but I wouldn't want to commit at this point as to what those developments are. Mark Snell : And, finally you may have missed it on the question before, but we did discuss that we're talking about FID with that project with Port Arthur sort of late 2017 all the way into late 2018 sort of that time - probably in the 2018 timeframe. Faisel Khan : Okay, understood. Then just on the Cameron expansion just in terms of lowering the cost of the - or providing a sort of lower cost and expansion from the economies of scale. Where do you guys think, that is right now? Especially since you've seen steel cost come down and we've seen, I mean, what - like on a percentage basis like versus what you guys have outlined for this one versus what you're thinking about the expansion, is there any color you can provide on that? Thanks. Mark Snell : Well, there is a color I could but won't. Look right now, we think we have a very competitive project. We think our costs are some of the lowest in the region. We're marketing that to our advantage and I really don't want to give any more details in that. Faisel Khan : Okay. Got it. Fair enough. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Okay. Operator : And we will go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar Financial Research. Mark Barnett : Hey, good morning/good afternoon, everyone. Mark Snell : Hey, Mark. Mark Barnett : Hey, you've talked a lot about the PEMEX assets and the PEMEX deal, and some of your pipeline projects and upside today. I'm just wondering given what's taken place over the past few months, six months and what not, how are you looking at the attractiveness of the generation sector in Mexico. Mark Snell : Well, the generation clearly has been under stress in the U.S. Prices have been relatively low, but in Mexico there are going to be generation opportunities. On the renewable side, I think they will be quite good, they'll be - and obviously we're well positioned to do that and ESJ can be expanded pretty easily. But on the gas power generation side, and especially with respect to combined cycle plants, there will be opportunities to build those under contracts with CFE, but they haven't really been let that out that much in any kind of volume of [indiscernible] one and what we're - we're going to have to kind of wait and see - to see how that market develops. I think what they're doing in Mexico is actually really pretty smart, which is they're building out the gas network first. They're developing a very active gas market one that both CFE and the private sector will participate in to a great degree, and once if that, they have a robust gas market and a good supply network, then I think you'll start to see them let out the opportunities to build more power plants. But I think they definitely are staging at a little bit, and I think rightly so. Mark Barnett : Yeah, it's definitely been a slow process. I just wonder given that you're positioned already to be a fairly large operator of the gas infrastructure, does that give you some kind of a look into where you are competitive position would be, when those kind of biz do you start to show up? Mark Snell : Absolutely, I mean I think we are going to be very well positioned to take advantage of those, and I think - we have every intention of doing that. It's just that they have to meet our criteria for having long-term contracts and being solid investments which we expect them to be. But given our infrastructure and our knowledge of the gas pipeline network in Mexico, I think that we will be well positioned to take advantage of those offerings. Mark Barnett : All right. Thanks. Mark Snell : All right. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to Mark Snell for closing remarks. Mark Snell : Well, thanks again for joining us today. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team, and have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you again for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Third Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter 2015 financial presentation. A webcast to this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of Southern California Gas; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 3, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. Please turn to slide 4, and I'll hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Rick. During the third quarter, our solid operating and financial performance across the company continued. With strong year-to-date results, we are now raising our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range to $4.95 per share to $5.15 per share. In addition, we continue to execute on our five-year base plan and are on track to meet or exceed our approximate 11% adjusted base plan EPS CAGR for 2015 to 2019. Since providing those projections at our March Analyst Conference, we have announced more than $2 billion of investment opportunities that are incremental to our base plan. We have also filed for commission approval of our GRC settlement agreement for SDG&E and SoCalGas. I am very pleased with our progress this year and I'm optimistic as we move into 2016. Let's begin with an operational update and then Joe will provide more detail on our financial results. Please turn to slide 5. With regard to our base plan, I would like to first revisit the visibility of our 11% adjusted EPS CAGR. On this slide, we provide key base plan assumption. I will mention just a few points. First, the almost $20 billion of investments included in our five-year base plan reflect projects that were essentially approved, contracted, or under construction as of March 2015. For earnings associated with these projects, we have risk mitigation strategies in place that limit our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or commodity prices. We provide additional information in the appendix to this presentation. Second, our base plan projections do not include impacts from the proposed GRC settlement, the $2 billion of new projects or acquisitions announced since March 2015 or any earnings from our three potential LNG development projects. Third, we do not need to issue Sempra equity nor any potential MLP equity in order to finance the base plan. In light of the planned IEnova equity offering we discussed last quarter, we do not need to issue Sempra equity to finance the PEMEX acquisition or any of the announced renewable projects that are incremental to our base plan. Further, we did not include any earnings impacts from a potential MLP in our base plan. Altogether our five-year plan was built on conservative assumptions, and we are on track to meet or exceed our base plan earnings projections. Now, let's go to slide 6 for an update on our growth and development opportunities. Beginning with the California utilities, we filed a multi-party GRC settlement agreement for both SDG&E and SoCalGas in September. The settlement agreement is subject to CPUC approval. Under the agreement, SDG&E and SoCalGas would be allowed revenues sufficient to operate their businesses safely and reliably, and to provide excellent customer service. For 2016 through 2018, the agreement provides annual revenue increases for operations of approximately 3.5%. When including costs subject to balancing accounts, this equates to a total revenue requirement increase in 2016 of $17 million for SDG&E and $122 million for SoCalGas. Both utilities have also reached the second settlement agreement with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates for a four-year GRC term. The four-year term agreement is contingent on approval of our 2016 to 2018 GRC settlement, and on the commission approving a four-year term for all California utilities. If approved, the annual revenue increase in 2019 for SDG&E and SoCalGas would be 4.3%. Recall that our base plan projections assume utility revenues grow annually at the current 2.75% rate of attrition throughout the five-year plan period. Moving to Mexico, in July, we announced that IEnova agreed to purchase PEMEX's 50% equity interest in their shared joint venture for approximately $1.3 billion. The acquisition is expected to be about $0.05 accretive to Sempra's EPS in 2016, growing to about $0.10 per share by 2019. We currently expect the Mexican Competition Commission to rule on the transaction this month, and for the equity offering to occur before year end. In Mexico, IEnova also submitted a bid for the latest CFE pipeline auction, with award schedule for this week. Together with five other pipeline projects in Mexico that are currently being tendered, the total near-term investment opportunity exceeds $6 billion. I also want to mention that the Ministry of Energy has published the long-term plan for development of the national electric system. The plan outlines significant needs for new generation in electric transmission. We expect the initial transmission projects to be bid during the first half of 2016 under new rules of energy reform and IEnova plans to participate in these new markets. We provide more detail in the appendix to this presentation. Lastly, I would like to take a moment to comment on the status of Sempra Partners. In June, we announced that our board authorized us to pursue the formation of an MLP. The primary reason to form an MLP is to create a source of competitively priced capital to support Sempra's growth. As you are aware, current MLP market conditions are not ideal, and we will not go forward at this time. We are watching market conditions and we'll reevaluate our position in the middle of next year. In order to preserve this optionality about whether to pursue an MLP, we did submit a confidential S-1 with the SEC. As I stated earlier, we do not require equity from MLP markets in order to finance our base plan and we have flexibility in how we move forward. If we proceed, we will be convinced that the size and sustainability of the long-term value proposition for the Sempra's shareholder is intact. Now, please turn to slide 7. With regard to investment opportunities post 2019 that are beyond our base plan period, we continue to make good progress. For Cameron expansion, we filed our FERC application in September and expect to receive FERC approval mid-2016. We received EPC pricing for Train 4 with per train costs that are lower than Trains 1-3. We believe Train 4 could be one of the lowest cost LNG development projects worldwide and competitive in the marketplace. Now that we have firm EPC pricing, we can conduct focused discussions with customers, and we continue to target announcing customer agreements prior to the end of the first quarter of next year. For our Port Arthur project, we have received our DOE FTA authorization and are continuing our project assessment. We are targeting the first half of next year to execute a joint development agreement with Woodside. For our ECA liquefaction project, we continue to work on the regulatory and other project development issues with PEMEX. We view both the Port Arthur and ECA liquefaction projects as potentially providing LNG post 2020. With that, let's turn to slide 8 for a discussion of the quarterly earnings. Joe? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $248 million or $0.99 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $250 million or $1 per share. Third quarter earnings in 2014 were $348 million or $1.39 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude expenses related to the development of our three proposed LNG liquefaction projects. Similar to last quarter, we only recorded $2 million of after-tax expense. This number reflects the fact that a substantial portion of the costs are either being capitalized or shared with our Cameron joint venture partners and PEMEX. Earnings this quarter include reduced tax expense associated with repatriation. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we intend to participate in the planned IEnova equity offering, and now expect to use about two years' worth of dividends from Mexico that we had originally planned to repatriate. As a result, we expect an approximate $0.10 per share benefit in both 2015 and 2016 from lower than expected tax expense. Our current plan is to resume repatriation from Mexico in 2017 and 2018. I also want to reiterate that third quarter earnings continue to reflect the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas's revenues. This impact resulted in $113 million of lower earnings this quarter and $48 million of lower earnings year-to-date. Applying seasonality will have no impact on full year earnings. We will see a $48 million after-tax benefit in the fourth quarter due to seasonality. You can refer to the appendix for additional detail where we illustrate 2014 SoCalGas earnings had seasonality in revenues being applied. Excluding the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas revenues, Sempra's third quarter adjusted earnings increased by $15 million compared to the same period last year. Looking forward, we are now raising our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range to $4.95 per share to $5.15 per share. With regards to 2016 earnings and dividends, we anticipate updating our guidance in February on our fourth quarter call. Our new five-year EPS and dividend projections will be updated at our 2016 Analyst Conference. I will note two additional matters. As a result of IEnova's anticipated purchase of PEMEX's interest in their shared joint venture, we expect to record a non-cash gain in the fourth quarter from the step-up of our own investment to fair value. This gain is not included in our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance. Finally, as Debbie mentioned earlier, our GRC settlement agreement excludes an issue proposed in the proceeding regarding certain intra rate case income tax benefits relating to repair allowances. The proposal recommended by one of the interveners would require reducing rate base by $93 million for SDG&E and $92 million for SoCalGas. In addition, the proposal seeks to reduce pre-tax revenue requirements related to the 2015 year benefits in the amount of $46 million for SoCalGas and $34 million for SDG&E through the third quarter of 2015. Our current expectation is that the CPUC will rule in our favor and do so on the same timeline as our GRC proceedings. That is because the proposed treatment would violate and contradict longstanding rate making and income tax policy. It would also represent a material departure from historical commission practice. Please turn to slide 9. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation entitled Business Unit Earnings. Key drivers for our consolidated earnings this quarter include $20 million of higher net operating earnings in Sempra International including foreign exchange impacts, $14 million of higher earnings at SDG&E from higher CPUC base margin net of expenses and higher electric transmission earnings, and $14 million of lower tax expense at the parent related to reduced repatriation of dividends from Mexico. Offsetting factors include the $113 million seasonality impact that lowered SoCalGas's third quarter earnings and two earnings items that occurred in the third quarter of 2014. One, the $25 million tax benefit for Sempra Natural Gas from the release of a state tax valuation allowance, and secondly the $14 million gain on the sale of a 50% equity interest in the first phase of ESJ in Mexico. Now, let me conclude with slide 10. Overall, our financial and operating results for the third quarter continued to be strong, and they positioned us to raise our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range. Increased operating earnings at both the California utilities and Sempra International underpin our solid year-to-date results. Across the company, we continue to capture development opportunities that are incremental to our base plan and look forward to providing you new projections early next year. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Neel. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: How are you? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Great. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: First question was on the pipeline award expected this week. There has been some articles with some bids submitted or published. And it looks like you guys are a close second. Are those apples-to-apples comparisons and does that reflect how the ultimate auction will come out or is that \u2013 or is the CFE still ruling on it? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, first, let me say that they just changed the date when we will be notified on the bid to November 10, which is next Tuesday. And if you've looked at any of these bids before, the capital costs are not really reflective of who wins the bid, it's one component of the total bid. The real bid decision is based upon the tariff amount that you are agreeing to provide over the 20 years or 25 years of the contract in all of these pipeline bids, and that's what will be analyzed and looked at next week and announced. Capital is a component, your return is a component, what your gas costs for operating the facilities is a component, what you think in terms of additional capacity sales that you might get off of the pipeline, those all factor into the creation of a tariff rate and that's what they will be announcing next week. So, we feel good that we're in a close second, only $4 million behind the low capital, but there is a lot of other factors that will come into the final decision. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And second question on Cameron Train 4. Has the timeline been pushed out as far as negotiating customer contracts or MoUs, because I think previously you guys mentioned end of the year and I think in your prepared remarks, you said you'd have something maybe by Q1 2016. Can you just remind us of the timeline going forward and the market conditions for additional LNG? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. I'll start and then I'll have maybe Mark add some additional color to it. But I've been saying in meetings with the investors for some time that we were looking at the end of the first quarter of next year. And that was because we really cannot \u2013 could not even begin negotiating MoUs until we have the EPC contract and we just got that this month. And so now we have the information that we can get a firm price. And we're very pleased that knowing that and getting a firm price, we think Cameron will be one of the, if not the lowest cost facility in the United States for LNG export. And so that allows us to really negotiate a firm MoU. And we followed the same process when we did Trains 1-3. We really needed to know what the cost was going to be in order to have a firm MoU negotiated. Mark, do you want to add anything? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I would just say that we've been having substantive discussions with a lot of potential customers and now we've been able to give them some hard data to work with, and we do expect to show some results. They won't all come at once, and so we expect to have some towards the end of the year and in the first part of next year. But our firm decision to move forward on this would be late in the first quarter. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : You might also comment, Mark, on what we see in the contracting area there because I know that there has been a lot of articles and all, and what we've seen is that there are still a lot of parties out there contracting. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I think there's always \u2013 there's speculation in the press and rightfully so, picking up that LNG is oversupplied up through 2018, but when you start looking at the needs beyond that, when you get into 2020 and 2021, there's definitely a need for additional capacity and we're seeing that. And just to remind the audience, just in 2015 alone, we had 27 contracts signed. And 17 of those were 20-year contracts, four were 10-year and the rest were shorter term contracts. So there is plenty of activity going on, and we are certainly seeing that and we remain very confident that we'll move forward on Train 4. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: And, Mark, just to quickly follow up on the comment that off takers will need LNG in 2021. How late can they wait before they sign contracts in order to procure that supply? Do they have another year or is it necessary to make that decision in 2016? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : I think they really got to start making those decisions in 2016, especially for new projects because otherwise they just won't be online in time. We are probably the \u2013 as far as a new train goes, Train 4 can probably come online as probably as quickly or quicker than any other train in the market that's starting anew, and you've got to really kind of make that decision in 2016. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yes. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes, Julien. We can hear you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Good afternoon. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Indeed. So, perhaps firstly on Mexico, can you elaborate a little bit on opportunities down there, and I suppose principally focusing on non-oil and gas, but obviously this transmission, there's talk of electric capacity market like procurements, et cetera. What are you guys ranging to do down there at present? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean, that's a great thing about Mexico. I think, it's one of our wonderful growth platforms where we see layers of opportunities for our company there. And certainly, there is more bids coming out on pipeline, we'll see $6 billion worth of pipeline bids occur over the next several months and we will be actively involved in that. Following that, they are finalizing the market rules for electric transmission and in our slides we showed you some of the projects that would be up for competition and probably within the first half of next year. And we're very interested in participating in that market. Further, now some of the oil properties are beginning to be taken over as it is and we see some great opportunities to the liquids pipelines that will take how \u2013 take away capacity from some of those PEMEX properties that are now being developed. And also, potentially gathering and processing in those areas. And then the generation market we'll be opening and we have, as you know, the ESJ lands, property that could \u2013 we could add about another 1,000 megawatts or more to that area to do wind production. And so we see some great opportunities there. We also see some opportunities to really get some greater value add of our TDM plant. So, I think that and I would also add, I should say, that looking at our existing assets and a great pipeline backbone that we have, we can also add capacity with industrial customers to that and we're working on that right now. So we just see a great worth of opportunities, wealth of opportunities in Mexico and are very excited about it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Perhaps just a quick follow-up there. TDM, obviously, you've been looking for contracts a while. Is there an opportunity to re-contract that back into Mexico now because of the opening up of this market, I mean is this quote finally going to happen? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Those are the things that we're working on right now and we think that that those rules are getting put in place that would allow us to do it. Mark, do you want to... Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I was just going to say that the procurement for electricity along the Baja border haven't been let out yet, and so the CFE is working on that, but we fully expect that there'll be opportunities to contract that plant into Mexico. And you will have to weigh that against the opportunities on the U.S. side. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And then lastly bigger picture, if you would, in terms of the U.S. obviously we just talked about Mexico and the range of opportunities, but you all have been pretty active both on gas pipelines and renewables in the U.S. As you think about CPP, California's own 50% RPS, is there anything bigger picture we should be paying attention to, any observation? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, I mean there are two sides of opportunity that we certainly see there. As you know, we do the renewable development and we have the potential to add additional solar project that can sell into the California market. And as you know, since our Analyst Conference, we already got two additional solar projects sold into the California market, and that was before the 50% was adopted. So, we see great opportunities to expand our existing solar facilities. And then in terms of our utilities that the integration of 50% renewables is going to require both gas and electric investment and the reason it requires gas investment is the type of generation that's going to be needed to support renewables in the area is different, and the location of that may be different. And so we're looking at major investments to our gas system to support the future. The North South Pipeline which we have before the commission right now would not only reinforce the system for reliability, but also help provide for that 50% renewable future. And then of course on our utility side, we're going to have to make investments, so it will allow us to integrate all of the additional renewables in. So, I think there are some investments that are not part of our current plan right now, North South Pipeline is not part of our base plan nor are additional solar projects, nor are any of the distributed energy resource planning on it. None of that is part of our base 11% growth plan. So, we see that as all potential upside. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning/afternoon. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Stephen, how are you? Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very well, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to talk about dividends from Mexico. It makes perfect sense to use that cash to further invest in the business. As you look out longer term, do you think it's likely you're going to want to think about trying to keep more of that cash within Mexico rather than bring it back in the U.S. It sounds like it's efficient in some ways to do that. I'm just wondering whether you think this is more of a near-term phenomenon or something that we could see you extending out and trying given the excellent growth opportunities in a country. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I'll start and then I'm going to turn it over to Joe. I mean I think when we were looking at doing the dividending, it was because we had the net operating losses that we could benefit from. So when we look at the PEMEX deal, it made a lot more sense for us to keep the cash in Mexico for that major project. And so, I think to the degree that we continue to have major projects in Mexico, that would drive some of our decisions there. But why don't you talk about our plans, Joe, and... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Stephen. It's a great question and I'll just go back. I will remind you all that, we essentially built all the equity in Mexico from profits from international operations over the last decade or more and basically doubled the value of that as we took IEnova public. So, it's been a really good investment for Sempra and we will continue to want to invest in it. We do have public shareholders now, so we will pay a good dividend from IEnova and Sempra will receive some of that cash. We don't need to bring it all the way to the U.S. Our current repatriation plan has us doing that through 2018 but as we just said, we're going to hold off on that for two years so we can use that money effectively in this offering. I expect IEnova to keep growing and I would expect us to want to continue to participate in offerings as we go along so that we don't dilute our ownership so much. And so I think what you're suggesting is probably the way it will play out over time and that's been a really good thing for us. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That makes sense. Great. Thank you. And just on your DRP overall. Shifting gears, any feedback or reaction that you had to the different elements. It sounds like obviously the grid overall needs to change, which you mentioned just a minute ago, but just curious that any color and the kind of feedback that you've received so far. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I'm sorry. I wasn't quite sure, you're talking about... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Distributed resource plan. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : The distributed resource plan. Okay. I'm going to ask... Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's right. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I'm going to ask Jeff talk about that. Jeff, do you want to... Jeffrey Walker Martin - San Diego Gas & Electric Co.: Sure. Good morning, Stephen. You recall the kind of focus that program is really intended to make sure that all the investor owned utilities are making the investments, which are necessary to make sure that distributed resources like solar and other resources continue to penetrate the system. And when you kind of compare that to some of the other things we talked about like SB 350; that's designed to make sure there's a lot more central station renewable. So as you have more participation on the central clean energy side and the on the distributed side, it really sets up pretty interesting dynamic for the electric utilities to make more investments around transmission and distribution to accommodate those resources and particularly the unique characteristics of the fact that they're so intermediate \u2013 intermittent. But I think that the \u2013 one of the things we keep falling back on is we've got about a $5.8 billion capital program through 2019, and we continue to think of the DRP opportunities, Stephen, it's kind of a longer term opportunity. Part of this maybe definitional in the way some of the different utilities in the state talk about it. But for us, anything that comes out of the DRP, whether it's greater use of batteries, synchronous condensers, more solid state switches, more investments around electric vehicle charging, all of that we would view as being an additive to the plan that we already have from a capital program standpoint. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Just a couple questions on clarification and I apologize if I missed it. But what was the assumed annual repatriation from Mexico for 2015 through 2018 in the last five-year plan? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Joe, cover that. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : We basically said back in 2012 when we started, Greg, that we were going to do approximately $300 million a year. We didn't break it down between Mexico and Peru, but we set a roughly $300 million a year for that period, 2012 through 2018. And so, we're pulling back on the Mexico piece for this two-year period. So, you can see we're talking roughly around $300 million investment in the IEnova, $300 million to $325 million maybe, something like that. So, if you think about that, cut that in half and you see what the Mexico piece was for a year. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So, you're going to basically keep \u2013 so, you're telling us that $325 million is the amount that you're now not going to repatriate and instead use to help finance... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : In the two \u2013 yeah, over the two-year period 2015 and 2016. We already have the 2015 dividend. It's already in a Mexican holding company above IEnova, we'll use that and then we'll borrow some money for a short-term until we get the dividend next year usually in the summer time. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Okay. So, you answered my question without me having to try to figure out on my own $325 million. Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Roughly, right around that. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : And then the second question and it might entail a longer answer is, I know, you told us in the five-year plan what your assumptions were with regard to the general rate case outcome in terms of attrition, it was 2.75% and the repair allowance benefits would be flowed through to customers beginning in 2016. If this deal was approved, I know the attrition adjustments are modestly better. But can you explain the repair allowance \u2013 the prospective repair allowance framework and then also go back \u2013 maybe explain a little bit more what your exposure is perhaps the retroactive look at repair allowance goes against you? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. Let me start this because having been in this business for 37 years, I can't help, but make comments on how flawed I think the proposal is. And it was only raised in our case by one of the interveners and what they're basically trying to do is re-coup what had been decided in the last rate case. So, we think it's legal case retroactive rate making and I \u2013 we will fight it as a legal case that retroactive rate making. What in our case is, I just want to talk about our set of facts. Because I think our set of facts is really important. A record in our case was officially closed in July and we did not even file with the IRS for any consideration of a change of tax treatment until after the record had been closed and in the case of SoCalGas, it was more than a year after the record had been closed. So, we think that to try to re-trade this and to go back and recoup those dollars is fully inappropriate. And so we think we have a very good legal standing in our case with our set of facts and we will fight that. As Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, the dollars that we're talking about or the SDG&E for 2011 to 2014 is $93 million, and for SD \u2013 or SoCalGas is $92 million. And a memo account for 2015 because they were all concerned about the retroactive rate making effect and so they tried to cover it with a memo account. There is SDG&E $46 million pre-tax and SoCalGas $34 million pre-tax through September. We will fight all of this because the history has been very, very clear that it's to the benefit of the customers to have utilities pursue efficiencies and tax benefits and everything. And that the shareholders have to pay for all the research and work that was done to accumulate these benefits. And that the shareholder has always been able to keep those benefits in between rate cases, and then the customer gets them at the next rate case. And when we did our 2016 plan and beyond, we did incorporate in that $40 million reduction at SoCalGas and $19 million reduction at SDG&E starting in 2016 forward for that now going to the customer, which has been the regulatory history of how these things have been dealt with for decades at least since I've been here. So, we think that we will prevail on this issue with our good set of facts and we will continue to fight this, because we think it is a retroactive rate making situation. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So that sums it up, the worst case scenario would be you lose your \u2013 on your legal position and that goes as a reduction to rate base, but prospectively, you worked out how you're going to pull back the benefits? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Right. I mean that's the way it's always been, is that the customer gets the benefits flow through to them at the next rate case and we assume that in our base plan and Dennis and Jeff went through that in March, because we've always had that assumption that come 2016, those will become benefits that will go to the customer. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay, great. And then, a final question amongst the many things you guys have talked about, some \u2013 two of the biggest building blocks for earnings as we go into next year that were not in the base plan are the $0.05 of accretion from the PEMEX, which rises to $0.10 in 2019. And then also the continuation of this $0.10 benefit from not having repatriated cash from Mexico. And then you've got all these other things on the checklist that you've won that weren't in the plan that you delineated earlier as well. Correct? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. And some of those don't happen next year that they begin construction but they are not in service next year, so... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thank you, guys. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yep. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Chris. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. How are you? I wanted to just follow up back on Trains 4 and 5 here. Could you maybe give a little bit more color to the extent if there's anything different from what you said earlier in the call about the potential for getting a Train 5 contract signed in addition to just Train 4. And then, could you comment on whether the EPC contract preliminary agreements there were not just good but better than your expectations at all? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. I'm going to ask Mark to comment on that as he's smiling. So... Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Well, I would say that I'll answer the second question first, which is with respect to the EPC contracts. I think we were pleased with the way the numbers came out. I won't say we were terribly surprised, we suspected that continual construction would lead to a very low cost and we were \u2013 and I think we're proven correct. So, we do believe that it will be beneficial to continue the construction into Train 4 and that will actually reduce the costs for all of the trains in the facility. So, I think it will make Cameron a very competitive facility. With respect to any change in the way that we're looking at it \u2013 as to Trains 4 and 5, I think we've said numerous times in the past that the decision to go forward with Train 4 is really a Sempra decision that we've made in conjunction with our partners. And for Train 5, that will be a decision that's made by our partners and they're still contemplating that and whether they go forward at the same time or not is really not \u2013 is their call and really not ours, and frankly not that relevant to our investment decision or our financial outcome. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, shifting gears to the total return vehicle. You mentioned you're going to revisit the idea in the middle of the next year. Is there a reason for that timing specifically, and maybe you can give a little bit more color as to what you would view as a constructive MLP environment out there for you guys to have a low cost of capital? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, let me just say that the middle of next year is arbitrary, it's more that we want to see sustained markets that can make us feel that the cost of capital that we would receive by doing it is better than what we would receive at Sempra. And so, we did not want to give you a view that we're going to look at it again next month, and the month after, it's going to be \u2013 we're going to have to see really sustained improvements in the market that cause us to want to launch something on the basis of allowing our growth, this wonderful growth that we have to occur at a lower cost of capital. And if it doesn't deliver that value proposition, then it doesn't make a lot of sense for us to go forward. So, that's how we're looking at. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, hi. Just first, to follow up on that, so is the registration still live for the MLP in the meantime, or is it no longer kind of live? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, the registration can stay live for a period of time, and what we did is we wanted to have full optionality. So, we did this with IEnova, we did a lot of pre-work to be ready to launch if the markets were right. And we ended up actually launching IEnova faster than we thought we would have, because we saw Mexican reform coming, we'd won some pipeline bids and it made sense for us as a way to raise both debt and equity. But we would have to see the same kind of thing for the MLP, and so that's kind of how we're looking at it. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, apologize to move back to the repair issue, but just to kind of clarify, if we looked at the forward revenue requirement of the utilities, what would be the impact to that beyond what's currently in your plan if this is upheld? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, all I can... Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Is it just the lost return on that rate base or... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, there hasn't been a decision in our case. So it's hard to say what it would be. And I will say our set of facts is not exactly the same as another utility's set of facts. So, I wouldn't want to speculate, I told you the amounts of what the tax was over the period of time, but how it ultimately gets treated and everything, that will be litigated in our case. So, I couldn't really speculate on that. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then finally, the $2 billion of upsides \u2013 investment upsides to the plan, which I guess that's also separate on top of the rate settlement separately, but just the $2 billion of investments. Could we just go through those one more time? I know we have \u2013 PEMEX investment is a big one. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Right. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Is it the two... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : The PEMEX... Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : ...renewables projects? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. There's three renewable projects and then the PEMEX, the PEMEX was about a little over $1.3 billion and then the three renewable projects equate to the remainder. So, I mean that's... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : They are in the slides, Steve, on page 19. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And just at a high level, has anything gotten worse than when you gave the plan, any key drivers or is generally the rest the same? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : I would say the only thing that is down from the original plans is natural gas prices are down. So, that's a factor in \u2013 and you're looking at 2016, is that what we're talking about? Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : No, the whole five-year plan, the 11% growth... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah, so really \u2013 oh, the whole five-year plan. I mean natural gas prices are clearly down almost $2 from when that plan was put together a year ago. And FX, clearly, the dollar has strengthened against all the currencies, that has actually been in our favor right now because the Mexico effect is bigger than the South American effect. So, it's a little bit hard to see how that will play out over the five-year plan period because it depends on what the U.S. dollar does against those three currencies. And I think those are really the two main factors. Everything else is very consistent. We have a very long-term contracted business with a good regulatory model and we just got this proposed decision that \u2013 or I'm sorry, the settlement \u2013 proposed settlement, so feels pretty good. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. The only other thing that I would mention that I didn't mention in terms of the upsides to the plan is that we did get the additional pipeline in Mexico, that's about $110 million. So, they're all listed on slide 19. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citi. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Faisel. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Hi. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Can you remind us also just what the dividend growth rate is along with the base plan for 11% EPS growth 2015 to 2019? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Well, we had talked about a dividend growth rate that was around 5% to 6%. But that \u2013 and our board considers that every February and the great thing that we have is that we have all of these projects that are long-term contracted and then we will get our GRC decision by February, we will see the progress on construction of Cameron, which is going really well. And we will see if we're getting some contracts on Cameron 4 at that time and so there will be a lot of visibility to things that may cause our board to reconsider, is that the appropriate growth rate over the time through 2019. And so that happens in the February timeframe and we had targeted a 45% to 55% payout ratio at 2019 \u2013 and that, I think there's been no change in that type of a thought process, but what we do in the interim, I think, we're going to be looking at again in February. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And any change in your thought process around M&A? Certainly the midstream and MLP sector has been hit pretty hard, I'm not sure if that changes your calculus around how you look at assets and opportunities? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, we always look at \u2013 we've looked at a lot of the MLPs and we looked at \u2013 I think our interests would lie as, we haven't seen anything that is greatly attractive to us in terms of the composite in an MLP. But there are some assets there that if they need the cash and they need to start liquidating some assets that we may be very interested in. And so we've identified things that would be of interest to us and we continue to monitor those and have discussions as appropriate. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : See, let me just add \u2013 if I could just add to that. I see this transaction and the wonderful thing that we have at Sempra is that we have such high organic growth that we don't have to do those kinds of transactions to get our growth. And so I would just tell you all we're really picky about what we would acquire because we've had such success in doing greenfield projects that \u2013 and our returns tend to be higher on all the greenfield projects and the acquisitions. So we're very disciplined when we make acquisitions and I think hopefully you'll see from the PEMEX acquisition. We think it's a very good acquisition for us. It's accretive. It allows us to have a more robust pipeline system that we can grow from. So that's what we really look at. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, understood. And then just on the potential assets in Mexico, I was wondering have you guys looked at exporting LPG, propane and butane out of Mexico. I know a number of people have been trying to figure out how to export LPG out of the West Coast and it's been a difficult process. So I'm just trying to see if you guys have looked at that opportunity and if you think it's a viable option out of the West Coast. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I will have Mark talk about that. I mean, what we have \u2013 we have the ethane pipeline and that we look at all opportunities. We also have the joint venture that we'll continue with PEMEX. And so these are some of the kinds of things that we would see as being potential out of that JV. Mark? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I would say both in the U.S. and in Mexico we've studied opportunities to export various kinds of natural gas liquids and we haven't put a project together or announced anything, but it's something that we study all the time and I do think there's some interesting opportunities. So it's definitely top of mind. There is a real need to move some of these liquids out of the producing areas, and to the extent that we find an opportunity that works for us, I think we'd be willing to capitalize on it. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, last question from me. Any impact from the hurricane on the West Coast of Mexico to your operations or assets? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : No. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No, no. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, got it. Thanks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : We'll now go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys, real quick... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Hi, Michael. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys, real quick question. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Michael. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...on the U.S. renewable business. Can you talk about how much incremental room you have for the development of solar projects whether it's Mesquite, Copper Mountain. Really can you just talk about it fleet-wide like almost how much excess room do you have in the backyard, how many megawatts would that potentially create over a long period of time? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : So, I'm going to have Mark address that. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Hi, Michael. Yeah, we've got about 420 megawatts under construction and with respect to solar, we have about 280 megawatts of property that's still available for development. And then, we're actually in the process of trying to acquire a little bit more to increase that. And then, with respect on the wind side, we have just a flat rate, we have over 200 megawatts that's potentially developable there. And then, of course, at ESJ, we have, I won't say unlimited, but it's a very, very large amount of capacity that's potentially over 1,000 megawatts. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : And that can sell both into the U.S. or into Mexico. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Correct. Yeah. So, we do have \u2013 we currently have developable properties that we can and then, obviously, we're looking at new ones all the time. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And how should we think about contract prices and the economics of the projects you announced at the second quarter call versus ones you started development on three years or four years ago? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : I would say that the economics are very similar or sort of within 75 basis points of each other. Our returns, we don't really announce what the returns are, but the prices are cheaper because of the cost of this \u2013 of the product of both in wind and solar has dropped dramatically and that's made a big difference. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, Mark. Much appreciated. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : All right. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go now to Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Hey. Good afternoon/good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Mark. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Thanks for all of the details today. It's been a really helpful call. A couple of just quick questions, just one clarification for the $0.10 \u2013 extra $0.10 in guidance that was assuming approval of the PEMEX buyout this year? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : You want me to answer it? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I'll have Joe answer that. Yeah. Go ahead, Joe. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah, Mark. No, that was our reassessment of our desire to make the investment of the two years where the dividends, 2015 and 2016 dividends. And so we have recast our tax expense to assume that we will only repatriate this year and next year from Peru and not Mexico, so that's locked in, we are doing that. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Okay, okay. So that decision was certainly not then contingent on approval, okay. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : It's not contingent on the closing, no. We're just not going to repatriate those monies for 2015 or 2016. We believe that the deal will close and we will fund it. And so there is no contingency there. We've already adjusted in the third quarter tax expense for that and so you'll see also lower tax expense in the fourth quarter combined that will be the $0.10. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Okay, great. Sorry, I was a little confused on that. And more of just a big picture question since it's a new development. With the transmission bids that will be beginning in 2016, how do you view your competitive position there given that your existing relationships in gas is sort of a different ball game, I guess, on the electric side? Can you maybe talk about sort of the competition and the clarity that you've seen around the bid structures, obviously something that took some time to develop with the gas? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I think a couple of things. We have some outstanding experience building major transmission projects in difficult areas. Sunrise is probably one of the most difficult transmission projects to get done and it got done on time, on budget. So \u2013 and I think our company has shown our ability to work through regulatory agencies and get all of that done. When you go to Mexico then and you take some of those skills and you transfer that rights of way will be a key issue. It's very similar on the gas and electric side and in fact there may be cases where the transmission could use some existing rights of way that we've already acquired. And then, the siting of the line, the ability to work with the agencies, CFE would be the agency that would be bidding these out and we have good experience working with CFE. And I think having a workforce of several hundred people headquartered in Mexico City that know how to work through these processes, I think that we're in a really good place to enter that area of the business with the experience that we have in Sempra and do quite well in it. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. And I would just add to that we have developed transmissions lines outside of the U.S. as well. We've been one of the \u2013 we've done a good job of building transmission in Chile, we've built some things in Peru. And so it's not \u2013 we're not without experience outside of the U.S. as well. So, I think given the combination of experience that we have and our relationship with the CFE, I think we're in \u2013 we should be in very good standing to be competitive in that market. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : All right. Thanks for your thoughts, guys. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Sure. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management. Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC : Good afternoon. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Hi, Michael. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Michael. Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC : Hi. I wanted to get more understanding on the guidance and the $0.15. So, you increased the midpoint by $0.25 of which $0.10 is taxes. Can you maybe help me understand the other $0.15, since it's not PEMEX? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, I think if you look at the strength of our business so far this year, you look at how our performance is all of our businesses, and then you adjust for seasonality at SoCalGas, our utilities are having very strong years, our other businesses are having very strong years. So, we look at where we are today and where we think that we will be at the end of the year across all of our businesses. And I think everything is doing very well. So, there is not like one thing that's behind it. There is $0.10 for the tax, the repatriation issue, but the rest of it is across our businesses. Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC : So, it's not one specific thing and it's not GRC and it's not PEMEX, right, it's just kind of spread out... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, the GRC doesn't take effect until next year. PEMEX will not close until later this year, so it won't be until 2016 earnings. So you won't see the GRC effect until 2016 nor will you see the effect of PEMEX until 2016. So it's neither of those, it's just the strength of our base operations across the board. Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC : And then the other part that I'm trying to understand, since you were raised $0.15 but you kept CAGR as the same, is the starting point now high and thus the ending point will \u2013 and is the ending point also higher? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I'm not sure I understood it. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : He is saying we're raising $0.15. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : But keeping the CAGR the same. I mean, we're not setting a new CAGR. Debbie was talking about our approximately 11% CAGR that was in the Analyst Conference. We're not telling you a new number yet. We'll give you a new guidance when we have the conference or what our 2016 to 2020 number is. But we've already said we already know that the numbers are all getting higher, because we have $2 billion more projects, we have a number of positive things going for us. So I think you can glean from that that it wasn't lifting up the front and keeping the end smaller, that's not our intent of this conversation. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. But I will also say that that's a 2015 to a 2019 CAGR. And one of the reasons that has some big effect is that the end of the period what's been great is that we've been able to produce strong results at the beginning of the period. So that Cameron adds a lot in 2018 and 2019 to that growth rate, but we're also growing our business in a lot of other areas and we've had exceptional performance in safety, reliability, customer and financial performance from our utilities as well as our other businesses. Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC : So, what I'm hearing is both conceptually things are going great and mathematically as well, if we just crunch the numbers... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : We just won't tell you what number to forecast, that's it. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Vedula Murti with CDP Capital. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: Good morning, good afternoon depending how \u2013 wherever you are. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hello. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: I'm fine. I'm wondering given the sales to the MLP market and everything, yeah, I'm sure \u2013 I would suspect you have this theory at least some inventory of very mature assets where the EBITDA and everything like that is on full run rate and everything like that and there are other entities that are going to be needing to big machines, so to speak. So, can you give me a sense as to what \u2013 and you guys have always been very, very good at recycling capital. So, can you give us unless I missed this earlier, I did show up a little bit late, I showed up in the Q&A. Can you give a sense as to what might be available in terms of either in some gross EBITDA value or something like that or certain types of assets that you think that it will recycle capital during this period, while you're waiting to see things stabilize if they're all on their optimal run rates? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. If your question is like what is our capital allocation methodology and our enterprise, is that what you're trying to get at? Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: Well, I'm trying to get at the fact is that you probably have certain plants or assets or whatever that already at regular run rates and they're contracted and the fact is that those \u2013 in theory would have probably been appropriate for holding on to for an MLP, but if the MLP is going to be pushed off and you have MLPs and YieldCos that are going to need to acquire in order to justify their own cost of capital, the question is whether you have a inventory of assets that you can recycle capital perhaps at better rates than sitting on them right now and just waiting for the MLP market or whatever to turn around? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I would say that we always look at our assets everyday as if we've just bought the company. And so everything we look at if it is \u2013 makes sense for us to sell it and to exit that, we're willing to do it and same thing in terms of looking at acquisitions. We're very disciplined on that. I will give you examples of what we've done in the past, I can't tell you what we might do in the future, it depends on what the market is, what kind of pricing we could get, but we decided to exit merchant generation because it didn't fit our model and we filled our power plants as an example. So those are the kinds of things that we do on a regular basis and a lot depends on what the market conditions are and what kind of premiums will be paid and whether or not it would make sense for us to exit that, and then redeploy capital into some future growth. And we always think that way, but I'm not going to list any kind of assets that are for sale. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : And I guess I would just add to that too is that, all of our large assets that we expect to be \u2013 essentially fully contracted and moving forward, and if you look at our pipelines in Mexico, our LNG facilities, all of those we believe have expansion capability. And so it's not like \u2013 even though they're fully contracted for their current size, we think all of them can \u2013 especially in Mexico, we're in the process of expanding capacity on some of our existing pipelines and adding additional revenue. We're looking obviously at Train 4 to Cameron. We're looking at additional facilities. So I think we've got a lot of growth left in a lot of our major assets. So we really wouldn't be looking at that at this time. We want to be completely sure that we capture all of that growth and all of that additional revenue. But I think for more mature assets down the road, as Debbie said, we always look at that stuff. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: Well, maybe the point I was trying to distinguish between kind of legacy, fully mature assets that are at their full EBITDA run rates or whatever where there is not \u2013 it's obviously contributing, but there is not necessarily \u2013 that's not the growth component. And I'm trying to distinguish that between Mexico expansions or Cameron or whatever. And I just don't know what your \u2013 what the pot might be that because you guys have been one of the best in our industry in terms of recycling capital. So I'm just curious if you can give a sense of what that. Assuming this is the way you're thinking about whether there is a part of recycle book capital that is sitting there that's depending on given the other market participants. That's what I'm trying to get a sense of. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I think that when we look at what we've had, all I can tell you is what we've done historically and we did that with coal plants that we bought and we sold that when we thought the market was changing. We did that when our generation plants came off the DWR contracts and that they no longer fit our model because we go for long-term contracts. So we always look at the market and we always look at what's left in our contracts. What we think is a little chance of re-contracting, is there more value there to us that we could get out of the asset. I mean, that's the way we look at it and so I am not going to go through how we would look at specific assets, but I can tell you that's the methodology we use. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: Well, one last question and I'll let someone else go. And given that history and the way you describe it, what starts bidding that type of thing to be examined, like for instance, gas storage, the Mid-South (67:20) or something like that. I'm just curious \u2013 I'm sure, not everything is perfect. So, the fact is \u2013 and you guys have always been very, very good at identifying that. So, I just want to get a sense of what might be available just to recycle and optimize? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I just don't think I can answer what we would plan to look at selling. I think I can tell you what the methodology is. And when we look at an asset like storage, I can tell you it's at very low values right now in comparison to what it's been in the past, but you see what's happening in the gas market and you see what's happening relative to coal to gas conversion and the need for storage by utilities and then all of the LNG plants in the Gulf. So the way we would look at an asset like that is do we think it could have greater value to our shareholders in the future, and are there ways to optimize that, and how much could we get to sell it in the market, and that's the way we would always look at those kinds of assets. So, I really don't think I can give you a list of what we would be considering \u2013 that wouldn't even be a good thing to do for our shareholders in terms of any kind of negotiation. So, I think that's all I can really say. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. I'll let other people ask questions. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : How are you doing? Just, I know you've been asked this by Greg and Steve, but I just want to make sure I have a better understanding. With respect to the repairs deduction rate base potential impact, you mentioned a couple of different numbers, you mentioned memorandum account numbers. And I just wasn't sure what \u2013 on a corporate wide basis, what kind of rate base is actually sort of being challenged here retroactively, which you guys don't plan on \u2013 I understand you guys don't feel a valid challenge. But I just wanted to know what we're quantitatively roughly speaking about? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Okay. Joe, I'm going to ask you to cover it... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Okay. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : ...and see if you can explain it better than I did. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, you explained it well. I think that the proposal suggested that we took the 2011 to 2014 savings and that added up to $185 million on a Sempra-wide basis, roughly split between the two utilities, and that would be what they suggested should be reduced from rate base going forward. So, you can do the math and figure out what that would mean to a revenue requirement. Again, we don't believe that's going to be sustained. The memorandum account really dealt with 2015 and they treated that separately, they're trying to get around retroactive rate making, as Debbie suggested. So, the sum of the two numbers that she gave you, and they were in my remarks as well, totaled $80 million on a pre-tax basis through September, less than $50 million after-tax. That would be a 2015 impact, that wouldn't go to rate base, it would just be a direct impact, that they were requesting. This is what they requested as a way to get around the retroactive rate making. We don't think they will be able to sustain it. But that's the way it would work. So, the rate base is only that $92 million and $93 million. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Let me further say, though, who the \"they\" is, because what I want to stress is that we don't have a proposed decision that does this. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Right. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : The \"they\" is TURN, one of the interveners in the case and this is their proposal in the case. And so we have not yet received a proposed decision and we will make a very strong case that the record was closed, officially closed by the ALJ before we even filed with the IRS to make these changes. So, I just want to be sure that the facts are really clear on this. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : No, absolutely, and I apologies for having \u2013 there were a few numbers running around that I wanted to make sure I understood them. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No. It was a good question. I am glad you clarified. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And then with respect to the master limited partnership vehicle and what have you, it seems to me that people \u2013 the Street and what have you sort of wanted you guys to move faster on this a while ago, and I don't know, you guys didn't, and the situation has changed and you guys are looking at what the opportunities might be on a sustained basis. I am just sort of wondering, I mean strategically when you see something like what's happened in the markets and what have you, whether or not it makes the bar higher or you think more about how you might want to unwind something, if it ends up that \u2013 I mean because obviously these are not really short-term financing plans. These are supposed to be vehicles that last for a period of time. And I am just wondering when you have something that we just recently experienced, what does that make you think about \u2013 I mean, in terms of \u2013 does it make the bar higher? I mean, what do you guys think about it, I guess, is what I am asking? I mean, sort of a little bit more elaboration in terms of obviously if it doesn't make sense, you're not going to do it, but not only that, if it \"does make sense\" for a period of time, does \u2013 what would give you \u2013 do need more confidence in terms of that or just how do you think about that, do you follow what I'm saying? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I'll start a little bit and then I'm going to ask Mark to add to that. I think that one of the things that became apparent was that there is some limited liquidity in that market. And that the effects were great when people needed to change portfolios and clear out of that market, and that creates a sense of discomfort for us, because that's not what we see in the Sempra stock. And so what we want to be able to see is that there is the ability to have \u2013 and that you can differentiate, and I think you still do see that in the market. You can differentiate quality from things that are not quality, and quality continues to trade well even if that whole market segment is not trading as well. Because I mean that's always been what we've been after is if we're going to do this, it's going to be all about quality, and that if we can't get the value for that quality, then it doesn't make sense for us to go forward. So, Mark, do you want to add? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I guess my only add to that would be \u2013 I think when we looked at this, in the beginning I think we had some skepticism and then as we watched these things progress over the last few years, it was clear to us that there was a cost of capital advantage to these entities and that was worth taking advantage of and we had ideal assets, and we still do have ideal assets for that kind of vehicle that was valuing cash flows at very high multiples or very low yields. But I think to your point, Paul, and it's a very good one, which is does this disruption in the market give us some pause to think that this was more \u2013 something like a passing fad. And I think at the end of the day, I think there's a high probability that these long, sustainable cash flows will continue to garner a yield that makes the capital look really \u2013 that makes the cost of the capital look really attractive. But I do think that we have to kind of make sure that we're in a market that supports that for the long haul and that there's enough liquidity in that market that, as Debbie said, the ones that have \u2013 that truly aren't tainted by underlying commodity prices can shine, and can still garner that low cost. And that's got to be proven and whether that can happen in the next six months or a year, we don't know. But I think we're going to keep our options open and look at it and take advantage of it, if it makes sense. And if it doesn't, we're perfectly okay to keep \u2013 to do the course that we are on, which is just as a C corp and I think we can be very competitive with cost of capital and we've got a great business here. So the good news is our underlying assets and business are super \u2013 are just really sound and we don't have to avail ourselves of any one particular mechanism to raise capital. We have lots of opportunities for that and we can meet our capital needs without any real problem. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, great. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Let me just add on one more thing and Mark just alluded to it. But you guys may or may not have seen this, in the last several months including last week, we got a affirmation of our credit ratings and S&P just moved us to a stronger business risk profile from strong to excellent. We've a very strong business and we can finance our growth and this was an opportunity to maybe do something that was really cheap and good. And so to everything Mark and Debbie said, I just want to add that, we have a very strong credit ratings and we can finance our growth, we will need it. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Great. I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Paul. Operator : We'll now go to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : A quick follow-up question. Can you just go through in a little more detail what your net exposure is to currency with Mexico offsetting the exposure in Chile and Peru. And then sort of a secondary question on that is in the places where you're dollar denominated, I know that functionally inflates you, but if we continue to have a strong dollar, doesn't that put pressure on the regulatory construct and how do we think about risk in that framework? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Joe, do you want to take that or Trevor? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I will speak first and then I'll let Trevor go through all the numbers of the net exposure and so forth. But as you know, we have a natural hedge here because we have when the dollar strengthens on all three of the currencies, in Chile and Peru, we have a reduction of our growth because of the translation of the two currencies in South America to the dollar by offsetting that is the fact that we do have dollar functional currency in Mexico because fundamentally most of the businesses are in dollars. So we pay our taxes in pesos and we have some other adjustments in the income tax expense as a function of their income tax rules that impact us in the opposite direction when all three currencies decline. And so that's what we've seen over time. So I'll let Trevor walk through what the numbers were for the quarter... Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Sure, Greg Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : ...and year-to-date. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yeah. So for the quarter, we had a total decline in earnings from translation of the earnings of about $6 million for the quarter between Chile and Peru and that is more than offset by a $17 million pickup in Mexico and as Joe said that, that's primarily from the revaluation of the taxes. So the net benefit in the quarter was $11 million. And then year-to-date, it's not much different, it's about $14 million of a benefit year-to-date and that was driven by $13 million of the P&L hurt that we took in the translation of the earnings from Chile and Peru offset by $27 million net of NCI for Mexico, giving us a net benefit year-to-date of $14 million. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : And, Greg, let me just add to that. In South America, you're on point and say, we do get adjustments in our tariff primarily from inflation, but also FX too. But what we have seen in South America this year, it's a little bit unusual. We've seen currency devaluation without underlying inflation in those countries. So, we're not getting the inflation adjustments for our tariff. So, it's really not putting as much rate pressure on as you might expect. I'm not sure that's a good thing. I mean, we'd like to get the adjustment, but we're just not seeing high inflation in those countries. What we're seeing is just strengthening of the dollar and is probably more has to do with more U.S. policy and the strength of the dollar worldwide than it has to do with really underlying weakness in those economies. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay, so \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Go ahead, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I was going to say you move into next year and you update your five-year plan to the extent that currencies have moved dramatically, that would be reflected in your update on expected earnings from those jurisdictions, right? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yes. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Yeah, what we'll do and why we don't give you numbers until February, as we look out the forwards at that time for currency and natural gas prices, and we adjust our plans for those things as well as the additional growth that we've had in our businesses, outcomes like the GRC and all. So that's why we wait to give you our 2016 forecast in February and then at the Analyst Meeting in March, we'll give you additional information for the next five years. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : But in your opening comments, you didn't seem like you're too concerned that this one factor would knock you off the aspirations that you currently have? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, we wouldn't \u2013 based upon what we see in currencies now, we wouldn't see that and then gas prices are so low now, they've already been reflected to a great degree, and this is just pro forma. So, I guess they can always go lower, you can never say they won't go lower, but we have pretty low gas prices now. So... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Have a good afternoon. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Greg. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : And we'll now take a question from Feliks Kerman with Visium Asset Management. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is Ashar Khan (81:30). How are you guys doing and great results? One thing... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Unknown Speaker : ...which I picked up on the remarks is that we have a settlement with the commission that we might get a fourth year of the rate case with an attrition mechanism if I heard that correctly. Could you just go over that I might have heard it wrongly? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. No, you heard it correctly that with the ORA, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, we have a settlement for fourth year that would give us a 4.3% attrition for that fourth year and that will be looked at by the commission separate from our other settlements. So we have a settlement with eight parties for the three years and then we have a settlement with one party for the fourth year, that party being the Office of Ratepayer Advocates. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much and great results. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Reed, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, thank you all for your great questions. You kept us really busy this morning and we appreciate that. And if you have any follow-up, please contact our Investor Relations team and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Sempra Energy Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference. Just as a reminder today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host for today Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead sir. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team, Debbie Reed, Chairman and CEO, Mark Snell, President, Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer, Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel, Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer, Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas, Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of SDG&E and Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, President of Sempra LNG. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2016 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide four and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Rick. Before discussing the quarter, I would like to say a few words about the natural gas leak at our Aliso Canyon storage facility. On February 18, the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources or DOGGR, confirmed that the leaking well is permanently sealed. Our focus since the beginning has been on safely stopping the leak, reducing the odor from the well, reducing the amount of natural gas being emitted into the environment, working cooperatively with agencies and elected officials and supporting local residents, including providing temporary housing and air filtration system. Now that we have stopped the leak, an independent investigation of the root cause will be conducted. I want to emphasize that providing safe and reliable service to our customers is the highest priority for SoCalGas. We will continue to work with our regulators and customers to ensure our path ahead reflects these values. Later, I will provide more information on Aliso Canyon, and Dennis and Martha are also here to address your question. Turning to our financial performance; in 2015, we had very strong results and exceeded our adjusted earnings guidance. This morning, we reported full-year earnings of $5.37 per share, or $5.21 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2015 results were driven largely by growth in operating earnings at our California Utilities and Sempra International. In addition, our board approved an increase in the 2016 dividend to $3.02 per share. This payout represents an 8% annual increase and provides dividend growth that more closely aligns with the 11% annual increase in our 2015 adjusted earnings. Moreover, we are targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years, to better align our dividend growth with our projected EPS growth. Our dividend strategy is underpinned by confidence in our future cash flows and supports our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Regarding 2016 earnings; we have updated our assumptions, and are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 per share to $5.20 per share, when compared with the 2015 results, we forecast a higher effective tax rate for 2016. In part this is due to a large number of benefits recorded last year that related to the resolution of tax matters. Also as we move into the new GRC cycle at our California utilities, we will now be providing an estimated $60 million of repair allowance tax benefits to ratepayers as part of the standard rate case true-up. In our 2016 adjusted guidance, we assume that we retain all repair allowance benefits for tax years preceding our new GRC. Key updates and comparison to the 2016 guidance we provided at last year's Analyst Conference reflect several other factors. Notably, we include our best estimate of the GRC decision for the California utilities, based on our settlement agreement, as well as new market assumptions for commodities and foreign exchange rates that have changed considerably since last year. Additionally, our adjusted guidance range now includes approximately $20 million to $25 million of estimated LNG development expense. Regarding transactions we announced last year, that were additive to our base plan, such as the potential PEMEX acquisition and new renewable contracts, we expect our earnings impacts to largely occur in 2017 and beyond. Please note that our proposed GRC settlement agreement is subject to CPUC approval and we do not anticipate receiving a final decision until the second quarter. We have moved our Analyst Conference to May in order to incorporate an expected final GRC decision. And we'll provide you with our business unit guidance and longer-term projections at that time. Overall, we are well-positioned to achieve our long-term strategy of providing earnings growth that is twice that of the average utility but with a moderate risk profile. Combined with strong anticipated growth in the dividend, we are focused on providing top-tier shareholder return. Now, please turn to slide five. This slide summarizes the key assumptions included in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. I will briefly discuss each item and you can find additional detail in the appendix. First, as I mentioned earlier, this year, we include developing costs for our LNG liquefaction and related infrastructure opportunities. In 2015, we had about $10 million of similar expense that was excluded from adjusted guidance due to uncertainty about the nature and timing of these costs. Given progress on the projects and our estimates of the spend rate and amounts capitalized and shared with partners, we now include a 2016 after-tax expense of roughly $0.08 to $0.10 per share. Please note, however, that the vast majority of planned expenses targeted for Port Arthur and related infrastructure as we have already incurred most of the upfront costs for Cameron expansion. Going forward, we will be sharing cost for Port Arthur with our partner Woodside. We will nevertheless monitor our progress in securing market commitments and other needed approvals to advance the project. To the extent, our progress is slower than expected, we will adjust our spending accordingly. Next, we've seen a significant decline in natural gas price forecast over the past year. Specifically, the Cal border 2016 forward curve has fallen from $3.60 in our prior guidance to $2.60 in our new adjusted guidance. The impact from this assumption is a reduction in earnings of approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share that is associated with the LNG marketing contract from our ECA import facility in Mexico. Third, we reduced projected earnings from the TDM power plant due to lower power prices and lower expected capacity revenue. This month IEnova decided to hold the assets for sale. The sale would complete our exit from merchant generation and allow IEnova to deploy capital and projects that provide more stable earnings. While we project approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share of reduced earnings associated with TDM, we do not consider any potential gain or loss from the sale in our adjusted guidance. Moving to Parent, we assume that we will use dividends from Mexico to participate in a potential IEnova equity offering. We forecast a 2016 earnings benefit from lower repatriation tax expense of between $0.08 and $0.10 per share. Offsetting this impact is an estimated $0.04 per share after-tax of higher interest expense to fund projects in our base plan. Next, like natural gas prices we have seen exchange rate forecast moved significantly over the past year. Relative to our previous guidance, our current forecast is for the dollar to strengthen in 2016 by an additional 20% against the Chilean currency and by an additional 13% against the Peruvian currency. Projected earnings are reduced by roughly $0.09 to $0.11 per share as a result of translating South American earnings into dollars. In Mexico, we have not previously forecast the impact of foreign currency effects. We now include in our adjusted guidance a reduction in tax expense associated with peso depreciation during 2016. Based upon the forward curve at year-end, we estimate this benefit to be approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share. With regard to IEnova's acquisition of PEMEX, this ownership and their shared joint venture, Mexico's Competition Commission has required PEMEX to competitively auction two assets included in the original transaction. IEnova is negotiating changes to the original agreement with PEMEX that will reflect the auction outcome among other things. Our adjusted guidance assumes that the transaction moves forward with the same assets and closes in the third quarter of 2016. Based on this timing, we assume an estimated $0.02 of accretion this year. Our adjusted guidance excludes however, any potential gain associated with the remeasurement of our investment in the joint venture. In our Renewables business, we incorporate new forecast for wind resource and availability that reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. However, our base plan now includes 328 megawatts of additional projects announced last year that are under construction. Given that these projects are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016, we expect to see the full earnings impact beginning in 2017. Finally, for the California utilities, our prior guidance was based on a very conservative assumption that revenues would be based on our current attrition mechanism with no further adjustments. Our new adjusted guidance range includes projected earnings that are more closely aligned with the GRC settlement agreement, and our best estimate of the outcome given the record in the preceding. Now, let's go to slide six for our business update, beginning with the California utilities. In our general rate case, we are currently expecting to see a proposed decision in March and to receive the final decision in the second quarter. As you recall, we reached a multiparty settlement agreement with the major parties in the case. Until we get a final GRC decision, we will record revenues based upon the authorized revenue requirement in 2015. When we receive the final decision, we will make an adjustment to reflect the retroactive earnings back to January 1, 2016. Turning to Aliso Canyon; we have received confirmation from DOGGR, the California agency responsible for regulating gas storage, that the leaking well has been permanently sealed. We have approximately 15 Bcf of natural gas in the storage field and the field is stable. Moving forward, an independent engineering firm has been selected by DOGGR and the CPUC to investigate the root cause of the leak. While we do not know how long this process will take, we will cooperate on the investigation and share publicly available data. Consistent with new rules under development, we are implementing enhanced leak detection and well inspection activities. We are also working cooperatively with all of the agencies involved to determine a path forward for the facility, which is regarded as integral to the reliability of the electric grid in California. Reflecting the most up-to-date information, which primarily includes revised temporary relocation and well drilling expenses, we now estimate the total costs or amounts to pay (13:45) and those forecasted to be paid to be approximately $330 million. Of this amount approximately 90% is for the temporary relocation program cost to address the leak, and attempts to stop or reduce the emission. The remaining amount includes among other items, the value of lost gas and estimated cost to mitigate the GHG emissions. For the estimate, we assume the relocation period for the majority of residents ended on February 25, as they agreed upon with the City of Los Angeles. We have concluded it is probable that we will receive insurance recovery for the total amount, less retentions of $325 million. Beyond this estimate, we cannot predict all of the potential categories or total amount of future costs that we may incur as a result of the leak. We have at least four types of insurance policies that provide in excess of $1 billion in insurance coverage. Based upon what we know today and subject to various policy limits, exclusions and conditions, we believe that our insurance should also cover the following categories not included in our estimates. Costs associated with litigation and claims by nearby residents and businesses and in some circumstances depending upon their nature and manner of assessments, fines and penalties. I refer you to our 10-K for further details. Please turn to slide seven. In Mexico, CFE is tendering several more gas pipelines. IEnova submitted a bid for one pipeline earlier this month, is in process of submitting a bid for second and is preparing to submit a third bid in March. According to CFE estimates, the three pipelines represent an investment opportunity of almost $2 billion, and we expect award dates to occur in March and April. This spring IEnova is also preparing to participate in Mexico's first auction of renewable energy certificates. IEnova is looking at potential solar opportunities and may submit a bid to expand the ESJ wind facility with this joint venture partner InterGen. The CFE would be the initial off taker under 15-year to 20-year contracts, and total awards could amount to 2,500 megawatt of new power generation. In our LNG business, there have been two noteworthy development. Our Cameron expansion project received its FERC environmental assessment on February 12, and we expect to receive the FERC permit in the second quarter. Though current market conditions are not ideal, Cameron train 4 is a very competitive market offering for long-term buyers. Based on recent meetings with potential customers, we are bypassing the memorandum of understanding stage and are in negotiations for definitive 20-year sales and purchase agreement. While our sales and purchase agreement will take longer to execute than an MoU, we are targeting the second half of 2016 for announcing customer agreements needed to launch the project. This approach provides us greater certainty on project commitments, prior to incurring large capital expenditures. For Port Arthur, yesterday, we signed a joint development agreement with Woodside Petroleum that outlines development roles in the potential project. In addition to how we will share costs and market capacity, the agreement provides a framework for how we will work together technically to design a cost competitive plant. Last month, I was in Australia meeting with the CEO and senior management of Woodside, and we shared the view that Port Arthur has good market prospect post 2020. Before moving on, remember that we have not incorporated additional LNG or other growth projects in our guidance. We are actively working on development opportunities across our businesses that could provide upside to both our near-term and long-term projection. With that, please turn to slide eight and Joe will discuss our financial results. Joe? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $369 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $370 million, or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter exclude $3 million of expenses related to the development of our proposed LNG liquefaction project. In addition, in October 2015 an agreement was reached with the SONGS insurance provider for a $400 million payment associated with the failure of the replacement steam generators. Of this amount, SDG&E's share was $80 million. After reimbursement of legal fees and an allocation of $75 million of net proceeds to the ratepayers, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings exclude a $2 million after-tax adjustment to the loss on the SONGS plant closure. Full year 2015 earnings totaled $1.349 billion, or $5.37 per share. This compares to 2014 earnings of $1.161 billion, or $4.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2015 earnings were $5.21 per share. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings grew 11%. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation, entitled business unit earnings. I will address the key drivers for our consolidated quarterly results, now on slide nine. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter earnings include a $48 million seasonality impact that increased earnings of SoCalGas. We call that applying seasonality to earnings of SoCalGas does not affect full year results, instead this fourth quarter variance offset seasonality impacts during the first three quarters of the year. At Parent, we recorded $21 million of lower tax expense, primarily related to a favorable resolution of prior year's income tax matters and reduced repatriation of dividends from Mexico. The lower tax expense at Parent, along with lower effective tax rates of the California utilities were primary reasons why we exceeded our revised 2015 adjusted guidance that we gave on our third quarter call. Third, SoCalGas recorded $16 million of higher earnings due to a higher CPUC base margin net of operating expenses and offsetting these factors was $18 million of lower tax expense in South America in 2014, as a result of Peruvian tax reform. Now, let's conclude. So please turn to slide 10. Overall, we delivered strong financial results in 2015 and exceeded our adjusted guidance. Solid growth in operating earnings and confidence in our long-term cash flows supported our decision to raise the 2016 dividend. In order to better align our future dividend growth with projected EPS growth, we are now targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years. Looking ahead over the next five years, we continue to anticipate earnings growth around twice the level of our utility sector average. Combined with the strong dividend growth, we aim to provide top-tier total shareholder returns. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and start to take any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Debbie, I know that it's not \u2013 in the normal course, you usually don't update your five-year earnings growth forecast until the Analyst Day. But can I take from your comments early in your presentation that you still feel like the fundamental building blocks in the prior five-year plan that drove the earnings growth you articulated last February, are still substantively in place? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Greg, I think that's an excellent way to put it actually. If I look at the fundamental building blocks, as you know, our business is based upon long-term contracted and utility asset. And when we lay out our growth rate, the key things that are driving our growth longer-term are Cameron 1 through 3, which is progressing on schedule, on budget and we expect that to come online in 2018, as we've outlined before. Our Mexican pipelines are now, all except for three of them are actually in operation that are contracted, and so that is going quite well. And then our utility businesses and the fundamentals of our utility businesses as you can see from last year's earnings are very strong. And we would anticipate getting a rate case decision soon and one reason we want to hold off providing any numeric guidance is that we want to get that rate case decision and then be able to go through as we always do with you at the Analysts Meetings the details. The other thing I'd just comment on is, our board felt that there is great visibility to our growth. And since it's long-term contracted in utility, they were very comfortable, setting an 8% to 9% target for our dividend increases over the next several years. And I think that is a really strong statement in our sector to be able to grow your dividend at that kind of rate. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Right. And that's up from the last articulated target of 6%, correct? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. We had talked before of about 6% growth rate in the dividend and now we're talking about 8% to 9% over the next several years. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Shifting gears to Aliso. You've articulated what your estimate is relative to the line items you've laid out. As we go forward here and we think about the path to understanding whether or not there will be further costs as they relate to fines or penalties. Which of the primary agencies that will be reviewing the safety, efficacy, performance of the plant? And if there were to be fines or penalties, in what categories would they potentially fall and who would be the agency that would be deciding whether or not to implement them? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, let me just start by saying that the key agencies that are doing the investigation are the Department of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources or DOGGR, and the CPUC. And they're now beginning the investigatory phase to see what's happening on the leak. I'm going to refer to Martha regarding the whole scope of agencies that would be involved and how we deal with fines and penalties. I will say though that there haven't been any that have been assessed. So, it's kind of hard to estimate anything. Martha? Martha Brown Wyrsch - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Debbie. That's correct. The DOGGR and the California PUC are the primary agencies that would be \u2013 are investigating, and would potentially fine the company for what they discover in the investigation. And as Debbie said in her remarks earlier, our insurance coverage is quite broad with the four insurance policies that we have, and we do believe that in certain circumstances and depending on the nature and manner of the assessment, that insurance should cover fines and penalties. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Last question, in the California utilities bucket of things that have changed, I just wanted to be clear on my understanding. The first thing that's changed \u2013 has changed is or one of the things that's changed is you're no longer budgeting for $60 million of repair allowance and tax benefits. But the other thing that's changed is you've updated your assumptions for to take into account what you believe the impact is of the underlying economics of the settlement. Are those the two major changes? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Greg, that's correct. As we've looked at this, we told you last March that, when \u2013 under the rate case process that when we go through the rate case process, that there will be a true-up on this repairs allowance, and that was approximately $60 million. So, our earnings would be reduced for that going into 2016 in our utilities. But then we've reached this rate case settlement and when we've laid out kind of our guidance for 2016, our assumptions are and our range is that something similar to the rate case settlement would be adopted, and that's what we would anticipate. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Let me, Debbie this is... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : $60 million is after-tax right? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Hey Greg, Greg... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Sorry. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes, because it's a tax item, but Joe wants to say something. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Greg, this is Joe. I just want to make sure just to be clear for you and others, the $60 million was taken into account in the guidance we gave you last year for 2016. So that's not something that was new in our new introduced guidance today, but the GRC settlement was new, but the $60 million was in last year's number. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So $60 million was baked into the February guidance number? Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. But it's important to understand because it's a difference going from 2015 to 2016. So it's a critical item to understand. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got you. Thank you. I'll get off now. Thanks. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Okay. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Greg. Operator : We'll move next to Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi, good morning. Apologize to answer. To ask a question that you probably don't want to directly answer right now, but just you're on the one hand saying the 8% to 9% - Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes, can you hear me? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I can hear you now. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Now we can hear you. We honestly did not cut you off. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : We can hear you now. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : You might regret that you didn't after I ask this question. But so just on the long-term growth rate, so we have two data points today. We have twice the utility average, and we have 8% to 9% dividend growth that better aligns with long-term earnings growth. Is it fair to say the 8% to 9% is not a view of your long-term earnings growth? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes, that's fair to say. I mean I'll answer that question. And I'll give you a \u2013 I'll use 2015 as an example. We grew 11% in 2015, we increased our dividend by 8%. So I would not link the two directly together. What I would look at is, what are the fundamentals of the growth drivers? And the fundamentals of the growth drivers are Cameron getting online on time, our utilities performing well and our Mexican pipelines being constructed and in service and all of that is going quite well. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. And then on the Cameron 4 update and the decision to move to directly to a contracting as opposed to an MoU, could you just maybe give a little bit more color on why you're doing that, and is that something the customers want or is that something that's better for you so you don't have to commit as much up front? I wasn't sure I understood the rationale there. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. I'm going to ask Oct\u00e1vio to cover that, but what I would say is, we see it as better for us, because we do have a timeframe by which we have to commit to get Cameron in service and maintain continuous construction. So actually getting the sales and purchase agreements done and have definitive agreement is a real positive for us, so this is something we like to have in place. Oct\u00e1vio why don't you have a talk about it from the customer perspective as well. Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp : Sure. Thank you. The reason why is because as Debbie indicated, we have a timeframe that's tight and we're trying to take advantage of the long-term pricing that we have from our EPC contractor. So going through an MoU, we'd (30:58) create an additional step that might drag that schedule. And as you know, given the way, we structure our deals on the LNG. We're not just selling cargos for a price, which would be a much easier sale. We're actually putting together deals that deal with low commodity risk and essentially long contracting capacity for the liquefaction, so we have to speak a lot to our customers about the upstream conditions, where the gas comes from, where it's delivered, how it's delivered and those tend to be more complicated sessions. And as a result, we've all decided to go forward. It wasn't just us, the customers also decided to go that way. So the people we're talking to at this point, we've all agreed to pursue the supply purchase agreements and gas supply agreements as part of our discussions in order for later in the year to have the full commitment to take the commitments we need to make on the capital side to launch the project. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. And one last question on Aliso. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about the \u2013 and I know this is hard without the root cause analysis. But one is, the potential scenarios of fixes for the future. And then I guess the second question is, it does seem like Aliso is a critical facility for reliability in California. Could you talk a little bit about that issue and this conflict with some people wanting it not to start up? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. I'm going to have Dennis address that. What I will say is that the DOGGR has come out with a new set of rules that we're already implementing, and that they are very, very parallel to what we filed a few years back in our rate case for our program that's called Storage Integrity Management Program or SIMP. And so, I think that there are processes and things that we actually envisioned and already had filed for in our rate case that would allow us to safely operate this field going forward. Dennis, do you want to address further? Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.: Sure. Good morning, Steve. Yes. As Debbie talked about our SIMP program and you know at the utilities we have an acronym for everything. But we actually started on a pilot program back in 2014, even before we got an approval. And as you know, we have requested within our general rate case for additional funding for our Storage Integrity Management Program. So that, we're waiting for the final decision there. As far as the importance of Aliso and just gas storage in general to both gas and electric reliability, I think it's been very clear with a lot of the comments by both policy and regulatory leaders, especially coming from the California Energy Commission as well as the PUC that it's vital that we have safe and reliable gas storage to support not just gas demand, but especially in the Los Angeles basin electric reliability as well. So, we're pleased to see that even in the visit that Department of Energy, Secretary Moniz, when he came out and visited, he reemphasized the importance of making sure that obviously, the facilities are safe, but that we have been back online in order to support both gas and electric reliability. So we know that there is, as Debbie mentioned, there is a full process that's been approved by DOGGR on their comprehensive safety review, we're working very closely with them on that. There is also some legislation that's been presented that, so far is open to amendments to incorporate as a process that DOGGR has laid out. So we're optimistic that sounder minds now from a policy, regulatory and political side recognize the importance of getting Aliso back online as safely and as expeditiously as possible. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Moving on to Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Neel. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: It's been awhile since we've gotten an update on Mexico. Obviously, you have three bids coming up that are pretty important. Could you just comment on the competitive environment there, and what you're seeing and possible opportunities beyond just the CFE pipes at this point? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure, and I'll have Mark talk about some of the upcoming bids, but what \u2013 a couple of things I've said before and I'll say again in terms of Mexico and the key thing for us is that we have a really great set of assets in Mexico, that are expandable assets that have additional growth potential. And so, these bids are very important to expand the infrastructure that we own there, but they are not the only way that we can grow in Mexico. And Mexico now have some pipeline bids that are going to be coming for us very soon, we've talked about the three that are out for bid right now, there will be others that will come out later this year. Mexico is also going out for bids for about 2,500 megawatts of renewables. And we have our ESJ plant operational there, that has the availability to expand by about a 1,000 megawatt. So, we think that's a great opportunity and then at Mexico is looking at going into other areas of bidding with electric transmission and electric generation. So, there's bidding but there is also growth potential that occurs from the great asset base that we have there. Mark, do you want to talk about kind of the bids and... Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Sure, Debbie. There is \u2013 as you know there is three pipelines right now that are currently under that we have submitted bids for and we're awaiting the determination. In total, it's roughly a couple of billion dollars' worth of work. We think, we're well positioned for it, but as you've seen there are \u2013 there has been some increased competition for some of these pipeline bids, but we're sticking to our kind of strategy of targeting kind of high single-digit IRRs and we're really looking to try to pick up these ones that we think fit our \u2013 that fit our profile and what we're looking for and obviously, we're interested in these at the right price. But I think the most important thing is Debbie's point is on the opportunities around our existing pipeline footprint, which, just to remind everyone, we are the largest pipeline operator in Mexico. We're very well-positioned, not only for this new work, but to expand those opportunities and start building laterals into other industrialized areas. And so, we see the opportunity for IEnova in Mexico for continued growth. And I think we've all seen some of the comments on PEMEX over the last few days and their desire to raise additional capital and to think about selling some of their additional assets, we're very well poised to take advantage of those opportunities, our relationships there are very strong. And so, we're very optimistic about IEnova's growth potential. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. So to summarize really basically, you believe that there's a lot of lateral opportunities just beyond the CFE pipes which you can service off of your existing infrastructure. Is that the right way to think about it? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yes. That and also \u2013 and eventually additional capacity through compression on a lot of the lines that we currently operate. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then moving to the GRC settlement, the extension from Q1 to Q2. Is there anything to read into that bonus depreciation, extension, et cetera? Do you feel comfortable with the settlement at this point? Or any thoughts on that? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean we feel comfortable, but we're going to get a decision, proposed decision in the March timeframe. I mean that's what we're looking at. And the issue of bonus depreciation was part of the litigation in the record of the rate case and the settlement was made understanding that there was some potential for extension of that. So we think that the settlement is \u2013 we think it's likely to get adopted. And we think that we should have a decision hopefully sometime in the second quarter. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, good afternoon. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. So just following up a little bit more on the Aliso conversation, can you elaborate a little bit more on thoughts on next steps just both from a regulatory process? But perhaps, more importantly from an operational perspective, how do you think about getting the asset back in the service? And then also, how do you think about your own investment plan in light of what may be required out of that regulatory process, and or working around any limitations on the Aliso Canyon asset itself? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, let me just take a comment on that and then I'm going to refer to Dennis on coming back into operation. I think one thing that's quite positive is that when we filed our rate case we had actually filed for a program that would do internal inspections of wells and some of the things that has now happened on pipelines. And we filed for a program that would do that for storage facilities. And that in the rate case settlement, we ended up with two-way balancing account that would allow us to make those kinds of investments to do the review of the storage wells and go through them on a programmed planned kind of a basis, which is what we had proposed. But getting that all in place now and getting the facility operational for injection season, we've been spending a lot of time looking at how we use that program, which is basically aligned with what the Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources or DOGGR has kind of outlined as well. So Dennis why don't you kind of talk about what we're doing now with Aliso and all of our storage facilities there. Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.: Good morning, Julien. Let me start with Aliso and it's kind of really a two-pronged approach. First is, we're, obviously, as Debbie mentioned, we're cooperating with the investigation that's being led by DOGGR and the CPUC and they have an independent expert on the outside, a company call Blade Energy Partners. And so we're supporting them and they're really driving the time schedule there. So whatever time it takes for them to do their work and to issue the report, will kind of take its own path. But as far as getting the field back into service, as I mentioned DOGGR has issued its comprehensive safety review that we're working with them on. And it's very detailed process of testing, inspecting if necessary repairs. And as Debbie mentioned, it really does, it's very parallels, what we had put in place as far as our SIMP program and what we're doing from a pilot standpoint. So, we're working to expeditiously implement that. It's hard to tell at this point in time how long it will take us to get through all of the 115 wells. But the way that the program is put together, it does allow us once we've accomplished a minimum threshold of tests on all the wells, we can start bringing some of the wells on. We don't have to do complete work on a 100% of those. We can isolate or abandon certain wells and bring on the other wells at the same time. So, we'll be giving further updates on that down the road, but I think the key points there is, again, policy makers, the regulators and we're very closely working with all of these. So that they understand what could happen, both here in the summer from electric reliability standpoint and from a gas standpoint. We're all really working together to make sure that Aliso and all of our gas storage facilities are safe and reliable. And they can service our customers. We're also \u2013 there also is an emergency regulation that was put in place by DOGGR, is that applies to all gas storage facilities, not just Aliso. And so we're complying with that as well. And that includes things such as daily pressure reads, testing the wellhead valves, and some other procedures that have to be put in place. So there's a lot going on, we've got a people at all of our facilities. And we're focused on again doing this as expeditiously and as safely as possible. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great, excellent. And just quickly following up on one of the last questions, with respect to the decision to move from an MoU to just an outright contract. Let me just be very clear about this. Your confidence level is higher incrementally or you said, obviously less ideal market backdrop, but moving in that step, I would presume to be a statement of comfort that indeed this is moving forward. But I don't want to put words in your mouth either. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean there is no question that the market is tougher than it was when we signed Cameron 1 through 3. But Oct\u00e1vio has been negotiating with some very strong counterparties and they want to go to sales and purchase agreement, we want to go to sales and purchase agreement. That would allow us more comfort in starting to spend money on the facility, because it kind of lays out all the terms and as long as long you meet those terms, then they are obligated. And an MoU doesn't have that same level of obligation. So, I think getting these sales and purchase agreement signed, would give us a lot of confidence and being able to move forward with the facility later this year. Oct\u00e1vio, do you want to add anything to that? Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp : No, I think that we're pretty much as Debbie indicated, it's good that we're moving in this direction, obviously the counterparties are using resources that are expensive, whether it's a law firms or their internal resources. So there's interest involved in this. As you know this is a facility that's not selling into the current market, it's a facility that's going to sell into market 2020 plus. And it's going to be one of the lowest, if not the lowest facility at that point in time to deliver LNG to a time where just about anyone agrees, there is going to be a shortage of supply. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Citi's Faisel Khan has our next question. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, good afternoon. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, Just the decision to expense some of the LNG development expenses, was that for Port Arthur or was that for Cameron's trains 4 and 5? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Most of the \u2013 the majority of the $20 million to $25 million is for Port Arthur and it's to do the work that's necessary to design enough of the facility where you can price it so you can market it. And that is engineering and legal cost and all. And then legal cost associated with the sales and purchases agreements for Cameron, and then the related facilities, the pipelines and storage and all of that integrate with that. That's what's most of the costs are. And they're expensed because those are the accounting rules, once we get contracts signed, then we would expect that this expense to not be part of our ongoing guidance, because we'll spend the funds once. And once we get contract signed then we will begin capitalization of the substantial part of the project costs. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, got you. And then in terms of as you enter into these negotiations for train 4, what are the hurdle rates you're looking at in terms of a return on capital for the project? Is it similar to the IRRs you were talking about with the Mexico pipeline that are 9% or is it higher? How do you guys look at the returns? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : We don't share that, because we're still negotiating with customers. But we always look at what our cost of capital is on a risk adjusted basis. And that we would have a reasonable return for that. So I mean, that's the way we would be looking at it, and our returns tend to be in the high-single digits, low-double digits for most of our projects so. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then could you remind us on the pipelines in Mexico, the tariffs are in dollar denominated terms. Is that correct, or am I or some of them in peso terms? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : In Mexico, our tariffs are in dollars, but we pay taxes in pesos. And so that's why we have the FX issue in Mexico, which usually has recently as always been in our favor in Mexico. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So it just happens to be a coincidence that the tax benefit in Mexico offsets the currency depreciation in Chile and Peru? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : It's a little more than a coincidence. There usually a some relation to currency valuations around the world, but it has been more of a one-for-one offset in the past, it has disconnected a little bit as we've moved forward. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Faisel, this is Joe, I'll just add on to Mark's comment. The FX benefit in Mexico, doesn't have to do with the tariffs, because all of these dollar denominated contracts and our dollar denominated business is really the functional currency and that's how we operate in Mexico, but we have to pay our taxes in pesos. And the Mexican tax rules require that we have FX adjustments related to our monetary assets and then taking into account inflation. And so, as these currencies kind of move in a similar direction against the U.S. dollar, we get this natural hedge, natural offset. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, I think that makes sense. And then when you talk about your guidance though for 2016, you're talking about a further depreciation in some of these currencies, or are you just looking at the forward rates? I just wanted to make sure I understood that language. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Joe, why don't you kind of walk through that? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah, let me walk through that Faisel, because I think this is important for everybody to understand and we talk about it from time-to-time. But we have some really, really well run utilities in South America, and over time, those have done extremely well and you can look back to the early 2000s. They've done very well over time and we like those assets a lot. But they are local currency run companies and their revenues are in local currency. And so, we've seen a depreciation against the U.S. dollar because we have to translate those into dollars of about 15% to 20%, since last year's plan. So when we did the 2016 plan last year and showed you a number, those currencies have depreciated 15% to 20%, and there's to some degree, some offset in our tariffs and they catch up over time because we have adjustments in our tariffs. But we've adjusted the revenues or the net earnings from those companies for that change in FX rates from a year ago to the ones we have now. In Mexico, the tax expense I was just referring to a moment ago that's an annual adjustment kind of it goes from what was the peso at the beginning of the year to what it's going to be at the end of the year. And I think Debbie mentioned in her remarks that we haven't had this in our planning in the past. And the reason is we're not allowed to under accounting \u2013 GAAP accounting rules, we're not allowed to kind of forecast that. So, with this year, we put it in the plan because we know that the Mexican pesos forecasted to move about 3.5%. And so, we forecasted a change in our tax expense for that 3.5%. And so in 2016, we see a little bit of loss there. In 2015, we actually had earnings as a result of this. We had $31 million increase at Mexico and a $20 million decrease in South America, so we had $11 million plus. So again in 2013-2014, it was neutral and between 2015 and 2016 that is going to be kind of neutral. These things don't move the needle very much for us. They're pretty small. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's very clear and I appreciate that. Last question for me. On the Renewables segment, just \u2013 and this is a small number, but if I look at the topline revenues in your Table F (52:19) sort of year-over-year, they are down. I'm just trying to understand why. I know that there's a lot of stuff below the line including tax and gains on asset sale and stuff like that they tend to move the needle \u2013 tend to move the earnings. But on the top line, I would suspect that that number would be relatively stable. So I'm just trying to understand why it would be down year-over-year. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I'm going to have Trevor go through that. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Sure. Faisel, what's really happening there is some of that is really the assets that have been dropped into the joint venture structures. And so there is certain assets that we owned a 100% in 2014 that are now owned 50% and then are picked up through the equity method of accounting. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got it. It makes sense. Thanks guys for the time. I appreciate it. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Faisel. Operator : We'll move on to Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. One question on LNG, and less about your contracting and maybe more about just the broader LNG markets. I mean if you read the stuff that comes out of a lot of the economic consulting firms or other folks, they tend to talk about how the LNG market is oversupplied. And so that would imply that it would be a headwind for any new LNG development. And yet it seems with some of the things you talk about at Cameron 4 and Port Arthur that your views and your actions and potential growth are contrary to that. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about the global LNG market, what you see for the near term and what you see for the long term? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure, I'm going to ask Oct\u00e1vio to answer that, but what I want to ask \u2013 to raise to you, is a lot of this is a about timeframe, and that what you read about is the current LNG market is seen as being oversupplied. What you also read about is that beginning in the 2020 period, and beyond there is a need in the marketplace for more LNG. So, now part of it is the timing of these things. So, if you were having a non-contracted project coming on today, that might be a real challenge. If you have a project coming on, when there is a market need, and that market need grows over time, then that's a very different market that you're going after. So, Oct\u00e1vio, why don't talk about the broad market and then how we feel that our facilities are going to compete in that market? Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp : Again, a bit of (54:51) introduction to the timeframe issue. The one thing that we need to start looking at is the current market is oversupplied as you indicated, no discussion about that, but we also have a little problem with the current market. We have an oversupplied market and yet the spot cargoes are more expensive than the long-term pricing, which was agreed in the tight market. So market is broken in its pricing formulas, and the market is adjusting to it as we speak and will adjust for the next couple of years. But our focus is not the current market. Our focus is 2020 as I've indicated, where you'll see that the current oversupply would we absorbed and then there is a shortage and unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your point of view, these facilities take five years, six years to come online once you decide to go forward. And as a result, we need to make decisions today to meet that demand. It is difficult to make. It's large capital investments when a lot of the big players are taking write-downs because of oil, that's the condition why the market is tough. Some of the buyers are confused by the oversupply, but our focus is not the current market. So globally, unless you believe we're going to switch everything from gas to coal and oil which would increase our carbon footprint significantly and it seems like the winds are the other way around, if you do believe that we are going forward, not only with a continuous economic growth, but with a change to a lower carbon footprint, then gas is going to play a role not just in the current markets but in other markets that are yet to open. One interesting statistics I heard this week at CERA Week was the fact that the lower demand from Korea and Japan was made up by increased demand in Middle East countries and therefore the demand didn't go away, and that was not there in the earlier projection. So globally, where our projects fit? We're comfortable. It is a tough market for people to make decisions when they're under significant pressure. But we think, we are offering to the market the lowest cost producing facility for 2020, and that's why the interest is there. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And I remember at one of your investor meetings, you outlined where your facilities, I think it was your last Analyst Day. You outlined where your facilities sit on a cost curve relative to other global LNG facilities. Just curious, given the fact that Port Arthur is greenfield and Cameron was brownfield, the thing that surprised us back then and still does a little bit now is that they are so close to each other on that dispatch curve in compared to some of the others. How are you thinking about, how the economics of Port Arthur as a greenfield would differ from some of the disclosures you've given previously on Cameron 1 through 3? Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp : That's a very good question and I'll be happy to bring up another topic that sometimes gets forgotten. In the economics of the \u2013 pardon me, in the Cameron based project we included $1 billion of the cost of the existing facilities which is essentially replacement value. So the economics of Cameron in that chart you saw at Analyst Day, as well as all the other charts included the value of existing facilities. And so what we're doing with Woodside and Port Arthur is looking at ways to break some of the paradigms in the industry, keep it as safe and reliable as we want it to be as the customers expect it to be, but look at ways to reduce cost. Just like we found when we did Cameron, that we had the lower cost per ton for conventional technology of liquefaction. We have an even lower price for the expansion of Cameron for trains 4 and 5 and we expect to achieve similar results with Port Arthur. If we don't find that we can do that then, Port Arthur is not going to go away. We simply believe that the industry has to be going back to a discipline of developing the next lowest marginal cost available of supply in order to be sustainable. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you Oct\u00e1vio, much appreciated. Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Feliks Kerman of Visium Asset Management. Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP: Hi this is Ashar, how are you guys doing? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Ashar. Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP: Debbie, I just wanted to \u2013 there's a little bit of confusion, a lot of calls going on today. But if I'm correct, I heard you say in your prepared remarks, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that the goal is still to meet or exceed previous expectations set. Is that correct? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I'm not sure what expectations you're referring to. What we're very focused on is that the growth that we have outlined for you in our plans is long-term contracted growth or in our utility. And that what we put in our base plan is things that we already have under contract and then expected utility performance. What we expect to do is over the next five years, we expect to add projects to that. And this last year alone, we added 325 megawatts of renewables that will come online late this year. We've added or will be adding when the transaction closes the PEMEX acquisition and that was not part of our base plan a year ago. So, our expectations are that we're not going to sit still, we're going to continue to develop and grow our business. And that what we show you though in terms of our growth is and when we get to our Analyst Conference, we will do what we always do which is the blue box and the green box. That shows you what we have contracted and what's basically in our utilities as projects approved or in our rate case. And then we show you what we're working on that could add to that growth over the five-year period of time and we'll be doing the same thing for you this year. Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go to Morningstar's Mark Barnett next. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Hey, good morning, everyone. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Mark. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Thanks for all the comments on the LNG market today. I did want to ask one more question about Mexico. And I know that some of the pressure on PEMEX does create an opportunity in the \u2013 some of the assets they might be looking to offload. But I'm wondering if you know, you see beyond maybe this current slate of projects some headwinds just from the lower oil revenues from the Mexican government, and maybe if you could talk about how you see that balance of opportunity versus challenge? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I mean honestly, when you talk to our CEO in Mexico, he sees it as an opportunity, because the whole reason for a reform was to bring capital into Mexico to build the kind of infrastructure that they need for the kind of growth. And you have to realize, Mexico is going to be more competitive, the lower the energy prices are in the long term for them, that has been kind of their stumbling block on being globally competitive. So to the degree that they can use other party's capital and that would be us, I mean, we'd like to put our capital there and as if they can build the infrastructure that reduces their energy cost that they're moving forward on that basis. And so we think that, I think it's a struggle for PEMEX, with having being reliant on oil revenues, but it's an opportunity for us to come in and build things that wouldn't otherwise be built and that are needed as part of their long term Mexican infrastructure. So, that's kind of the way we look at it. Mark do you want to? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I would just \u2013 let me just add to that too. I think that the \u2013 when we talk about energy reforms in Mexico, I think a lot of folks are focused on the reforms at PEMEX and they haven't seen increases in production and some of the things that they expected to see from energy reform and I think that's entirely the fault of $30 oil, and very little to do with the reforms, what are coming out of the reforms is a massive amount of energy infrastructure within the company, within the country and that infrastructure is doing exactly what it's supposed to do, as Debbie said, it's lowering energy costs, bringing natural gas in the regions of the country that didn't have access to it before, it's making \u2013 it's really making a big difference on lowering electricity costs across the country, and that's working very, very well. And to the extent that low gas or low oil prices are hindering some of the reforms at PEMEX, I think that again is creating a large opportunity for us, because it increases the need for PEMEX for capital. It gives opportunities for us to look at the assets that they are going to be putting up for sale. And so, from our perspective, I think we think that the reforms are working very much as intended, and that we will continue to benefit as being one of the best placed companies in the country to take advantage of those opportunities. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Okay. And with the latest round of bids, I apologize if I missed it in your comments. I mean you gave the bid dates, do you have an estimate for when you might expect the results from the bidding process? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : They were looking at \u2013 they haven't given any specific dates, but probably in the March and April timeframe, is most likely. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Okay. Right. That's all from me. Thanks a lot. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Thanks. Operator : And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Debbie Reed for closing remarks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, thanks again, for all of you joining us today, and all of your excellent questions. We hope to see you at our Analyst Conference on May 24. And if you have any follow-up questions, our Investor Relations team is available to answer anything that was left off from the call today. Thank you very much. Operator : And again that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for joining.",

Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's first quarter 2016 financial presentation. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With me in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chairman and CEO; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 4, 2016, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Rick. On today's call, we are following a slightly different format. As you know, the final GRC decision for our California Utilities has not been issued. However, we expect to receive a proposed decision relatively soon. Because we have reached a multiparty settlement agreement, we continue to believe the most likely GRC outcome is one consistent with the settlement. We also believe we have made a strong showing to support our historical treatment of tax repair allowance benefits. Therefore, today, we are updating our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance and providing you with our long-term growth rate, assuming a GRC outcome consistent with the settlement. We think the best approach is to postpone our Analyst Conference until we have a final GRC decision. We are tentatively looking at the month of July in New York City as a possible date for the conference. Once we received a PD, we will confirm the date and location. In our other businesses, we recently announced the sale of Southeast utilities and our interest in REX. We expect to receive about $760 million of cash proceeds to invest in projects that align better with our growth strategy. As you know, our strategy is to provide growth that is roughly twice that of the utility average but with a commensurate risk profile. I will discuss these transactions later on the call. Our updated 2016 adjusted guidance range is now $4.60 per share to $5 per share. This range reflects approximately $60 million of reduced earnings from REX. The sale of our Southeast utilities does not affect current or future earnings. These earnings reduced from the sale can largely be offset by lower interest costs. Looking forward, we are well positioned for strong growth over the next five years. We expect our base plan to provide earnings in 2020 at $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted compound annual growth rate for 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. Prior to the sale of REX, the comparable growth rate would have been about 11%. Joe will address the growth rate further in his remarks, but I want to emphasize that we expect to have significant credit capacity in the latter years of our plan which will provide us with flexibility in capital allocation. We will discuss our plan assumptions, business unit projections and growth strategy in more depth once we reschedule the Analyst Conference. Turning to our financial results, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $370 million. As a reminder, until we receive a final GRC, we are recording revenues based upon 2015 authorized amount. Once we receive the final decision, we will report the impact of the 2016 authorized margins back to January 1. If the GRC had been finalized by January 1 and was consistent with the settlement agreement, utility first quarter earnings would have been in line with last year despite the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC. Now, please turn to slide 5. There are several updates related to Aliso Canyon. First, SoCalGas is cooperating with DOGGR and the CPUC on the root cause investigation through their contractor, Blade Energy Partners. We expect the investigation to take about six months to nine months with the results be issued by the agencies late this year or early next year. Second, we are working to get the field back in service for injection. Consistent with DOGGR's proposed safety review, we have implemented a plan to prioritize and test wells, with the goal to have the facility in service by the end of this summer. Third, we are working with state and local agencies to address electric reliability concerns. Aliso Canyon currently has about 15 Bcf of gas available for withdrawal. When deciding how best to use that gas, reliability for both the summer and winter seasons must be considered. Fourth, we are completing our estimate of the total amount of gas lost from the leak and formulating a plan to mitigate that amount. Fifth, the temporary relocation program has been extended to allow the county to complete in-home testing, with results expected this month. SoCalGas and public agencies have conducted numerous tests of outdoor air quality. Results continue to confirm that air quality in Porter Ranch is at normal level. Finally, we are addressing the litigation that has been filed related to the leak. With regards to costs, we have incurred additional amounts, primarily from continuation of the temporary relocation program, as ordered by the court. The court has scheduled a follow-up hearing on June 7. Based on an expectation that the relocation program continues through June 7, we estimate the costs for amounts paid and forecast to be paid at approximately $665 million. We have recorded an insurance receivable of $660 million. Our cost estimate does not include certain potential items as described on the slide. Please refer to our 2015 10-K and first quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on costs and our insurance. Now, let's turn to slide 6 for an update on our other businesses. Sempra constantly looks at our assets to determine whether they fit with our long-term contracted infrastructure model and whether they integrate with other assets to offer strong long-term growth prospects. We identified three assets that are no longer a strategic fit for us : REX, our Southeast utilities and the TdM power plant in Mexico. For the first two, we have announced sales agreements, and for TdM, we are conducting a sales process. For REX, we expect the sale of our equity interest to close in the second quarter and to provide $440 million in proceeds. The sale also allows us to forego expected future contributions for capital investment and debt repayments. We believe our capital can be better utilized to further enhance our strong growth outlook. As a result of the sale, we forecast a reduction for partial year 2016 earnings of approximately $60 million, which is included in our adjusted EPS range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. It is important to note that had we held our interest in REX, we expected 2020 earnings to be immaterial and dilute our growth, largely due to loss of earnings from west-to-east contracts that expire in 2019. In addition, we plan to permanently release uncontracted capacity held by Sempra. The negative earnings impact of this capacity release is projected to be between $100 million and $120 million and will be recorded in the second quarter. This amount reflects the acceleration of estimated losses that would have otherwise been realized over the remaining contract term. It is excluded from our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance. Moving to our Southeast utilities, we finalized the sales agreement last week and expect to receive $323 million in cash proceeds with the buyer to assume $67 million of debt. We did not see significant additional growth potential in our Southeast utility footprint and the earnings impact is projected to offset with reduced interest costs. Similar to REX, we expect to use the proceeds to invest in projects with strong growth prospects. Finally, TdM is the third asset that no longer fits with our long-term contracted infrastructure strategy. It is currently held for sale, and we are in the midst of a sales process. Now, please turn to slide 7. IEnova is building upon its position as the largest private energy company in Mexico to identify and originate new investment opportunities. IEnova is working on multiple development initiatives, including M&A, asset optimization, strategic partnerships with established companies and new companies seeking to enter the Mexican market, and emerging the opportunities in clean energy, storage, and liquids infrastructure. One example of asset optimization is the building of laterals of our gas pipeline network to interconnect with end users. Just this week, CFE awarded IEnova a contract to build a small lateral that connects our Sonora pipeline to a combined cycle power plant. In addition, the project opportunities identified by IEnova, the CFE bidding process for natural gas pipelines continues. We are currently evaluating two tenders with likely bid dates during the second quarter. In generation, we expect to see the second round of renewable energy auctions in August. And in electric transmission, we expect to see the first two bids under new rules of energy reform in 2016 and 2017. Each electric transmission project represents an estimated $1.2 billion of investment. With that, please turn to slide 8 and I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Turning to our long-term financial projections, we expect that our base plan can provide 2020 earnings of $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted earnings CAGR from 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. Some of our key plan assumptions include an $18.5 billion capital program including joint venture CapEx for Cameron trains 1 through 3, full-year earnings of $300 million to $350 million from Cameron trains 1 through 3 in both 2019 and 2020, a GRC outcome in line with our proposed settlement agreement and tax repair allowance benefits prior to 2016 being retained by shareholders and an optional $2 billion share repurchase. Under our base plan, annual adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by $1.7 billion over the plan period, raising our FFO to debt to roughly 22%. Including our targeted annual increase in the dividend of 8% to 9%, we project excess credit capacity in the later years of our plan to be between $2 billion and $4 billion. Leaving excess capacity on our balance sheet would not maximize shareholder value. We have used a conservative assumption of an optional $2 billion share repurchase, split between 2019 and 2020. While we do include this assumption, it is our intention to allocate capital toward high-value development projects. I will discuss all of our base plan assumptions and provide business unit guidance at our Analyst Conference. I want to remind you today that our plan is not aspirational in nature. It is anchored on expected utility performance and projects that are already contracted and operating or under construction. This approach gives us high visibility and conviction in our growth rate. On a final note, before turning to the quarterly results, I want to address the long-term earnings impact from the REX capacity release that Debbie discussed earlier. In the base plan we presented last year, we had only assumed about $5 million to $10 million of annual losses associated with this capacity for 2016 and 2017 because we had not factored in the financial distress that several counterparties have recently experienced. We had no capacity obligations in 2020. By permanently releasing the capacity now, our new five-year plan does not have to reflect any future losses from this capacity, nor any negative impact from the recently announced counterparty bankruptcies beyond the loss we expect to record in the second quarter. Now, please turn to slide 9. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $319 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported first quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude the $27 million after-tax loss on the pending sale of our equity interest in REX and $24 million of deferred Mexican income tax expense as a result of holding the TdM power plant for sale. In addition, just as a reminder, in 2016, we are now including LNG development expenses in our reported adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings guidance, whereas in 2015, these were excluded. There are several factors affecting the first quarter results that are either timing items, or items expected to reverse in later quarters. Please turn to slide 10 and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items. At our California utilities, we had $17 million of lower earnings mostly due to higher operating costs from higher depreciation and litigation with no increase in authorized margin due to the delay in our GRC. As Debbie noted, until we receive a final decision, we are recording revenues based on amounts authorized for 2015. Once we receive the final decision, we will record the cumulative impact of 2016 authorized revenues back to January 1. Including this retroactive benefit, we expect the utilities quarterly earnings would be roughly in line with last year which is important given the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC. Moving to the Parent category, we recorded $10 million of higher losses due to $7 million of lower repatriation tax expense that was more than offset by $10 million of higher net interest expense combined with a $5 million income tax benefit that was reported in the first quarter of 2015. At U.S. Gas & Power, we had $9 million of lower earnings due primarily to the impact of natural gas price movements on inventories that we sold forward. We expect this $9 million loss to reverse by year-end. At Sempra International, we had $8 million of lower earnings from foreign currency effects. This was due to a $4 million negative impact in South America and a $4 million higher positive impact in Mexico in Q1 2015. At SoCalGas, our Q1 2015 results included an $8 million GCIM award. No GCIM award was recorded in Q1 2016 as this reward was received in the fourth quarter of last year. Now, let's conclude on slide 11. In summary, we have updated our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.60 per share to $5 per share to reflect the REX sale. The annualized impact of the REX sale will also reduce earnings by approximately $70 million per year for the next few years. Our adjusted guidance is defined in further detail in the appendix. In terms of our financial results, while our first quarter earnings were impacted by the delay in our GRC, we will record the retroactive authorized margin back to January 1 once the final decision is received. Finally, assuming the GRC outcome is consistent with the settlement agreement, we project a base plan adjusted earnings CAGR of about 12% from 2016 to 2020. With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hey, Julien. Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Congrats. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Yeah. So, first quick question to get out of the way, what's the implied growth rate year-over-year on 2019 into 2020? You talked about share repurchases; I have been getting questions on it. Just wanted to settle that. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, what we've disclosed now is the growth rate through 2020, and we're not going to give any adjusted earnings guidance for 2019. We always give you the fifth year in our five-year plan. But I think you can kind of infer from what we've given you before and kind of the range of growth over that period of time. What I will say is as you know in our business that some of our growth tends to be lumpy because we have large projects coming into service, and then 2019 will be the first full year of Cameron trains 1 through 3 going into service. Those trains remain on schedule to be completed throughout 2018 as we've told you before. So, 2019, you'll see that come into 2019. And so, 2019 will be lumpy in comparison to 2018, and 2018 will be lumpy in compared to 2017 as the trains come in service. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : And, Julien, this is Joe. I'll just add on to that, exactly what Debbie said, but remember, the way we build our base plan, it will have utility growth ongoing from attrition and utility growth in South America, but there are no new projects that we have outlined that would come on service in 2019 and 2020. So, the growth, I think, you would see there or you would predict to see there won't be what we expect to have because we expect to have new projects. But we're talking about four years or five years from now. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And with that technicality out of the way, thinking holistically, what is the next focus, at least, of the company when it comes to that capital allocation? I appreciate you delineating the share repurchase as a placeholder. You are selling down some of the gas assets, deeming them non-core. Where is the company going? If you can at least describe your preliminary thinking. I know it's a little bit of an Analyst Day kind of question. But just thought I'd get it out there, especially in light of what should be nearer-term cash proceeds from the asset sales that you articulated already. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, let me talk to you about some of the things that we're looking at. And obviously, there's a lot of M&A activity right now in the space, there's a lot of opportunities. But we have a lot of organic growth as well. So let me talk about some of those things. First of all, we are still looking at train 4 being developed, and so that we would anticipate having agreements in place by the end of the year based upon conversations we've been having with the parties now. And that is not at all in our growth plan. So the numbers we gave you for 2020 has nothing for any additional LNG beyond trains 1 through 3. So we're still focused on that. We think it's a good growth opportunity for us. And then what we also think is the integrated asset. When you have such a huge demand for gas, the opportunity to develop pipelines and storage to serve those loads is a really great opportunity for us. So we continue to look at putting capital into those areas. I would also say that as you look at the opening of the energy markets in Mexico, they're at the infancy right now. They've only done some of the gas infrastructure. We have electric transmission, we have pipelines for liquids, we have pipelines for our terminals for liquid, we have a lot of more energy infrastructure to come out for opportunities in Mexico, and we think we just have wonderful foundation of assets there that allows us some opportunity. And then I would say our renewable business, we don't talk a lot about our renewable business, but we had a growing robust successful renewable business that we continue to have new projects that we find, and we have the ability to expand on some of our existing projects. What I would say is that we have a strategy that's really focused on growing at more than twice the rate or at twice the rate of the typical utility but with a similar risk profile. So, when we start looking at assets, we look at are they long-term contracted? Can they have low volatility because we know you all value low volatility with growth? And can they support our growing dividends? And can they give us the strength of the balance sheet that we're seeing over the five years of plan? And so projects that kind of fit that criteria, we're open to a lot of things. We constantly look at M&A, and we see some assets that may be on the market that might be of interest to us. So, our strategy hasn't changed and we just thought that the capital that we had in some of these things was kind of trapped and was not really integrated with anything else we had and was not going to provide us the kind of growth that other investments might. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And the last little piece there on the cash in hand today, I know it's part of the broader capital allocation, anything in particular there to emphasize? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Just the cash that you're getting from the asset sales. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. Yeah, I'll let Joe...yeah. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : No. I think, Julien, nothing particular. We're building out about $1 billion of renewables this year, and money is fungible. We're looking at all kinds of opportunities. Mark's groups are looking at lots of opportunities. So, I can't name one thing because there's a whole bunch of things on the plate. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Well, thank you, guys, very much. Good luck. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Julien. Operator : We'll go next to Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Neel. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: I just wanted to touch on Mexico first, the three pipeline bids which IEnova got disqualified from. Could you explain the reasoning behind that and if there's any way to reverse the result or appeal it, and how that may affect the bidding going forward for you guys? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. I'm going to have Mark address that. And because I think it's important to know that it was not kind of \u2013 it didn't happen with as being disqualified one bid after the other. Unfortunately, we had to submit all bids kind of at the same time, and we didn't find out about being disqualified for the first one until the other two had already been submitted. But, Mark, would you talk a little bit about... Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yes. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : .... of that really going forward and how we're dealing with that. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Right. Sure. I mean, on those particular bids, what \u2013 the methodology that we used was to adjust our tariff to CFE by additional capacity that we anticipated to sell to other customers down the road. But without specifying exactly where on the pipeline we would do that and that's the basis on which they would disqualify us. I mean, as Debbie said, we submitted three bids at once, used that same methodology. We're disqualified. We don't agree with it. And we've challenged it, but I think we've adjusted our bidding procedure going forward. And we've \u2013 frankly, it's kind of behind us now, and we're looking at the other bids. And we've adjusted how we're doing it. We would expect to be quite competitive in the future. So, it's not something \u2013 it was unfortunate just the way those bids came together, but it's behind us now, and we're moving on. But I will say that I think talking about Mexico in particular, we're still in a very, very good competitive position there and I'm really pleased with the growth that we've had. It's unfortunate you don't see it quite in the financials, but our EBITDA there was up 19% from $93 million last year to $110 million if you include our ownership in the JV and our proportionate share of their EBITDA. And it gets masked a little bit in the GAAP reporting and because of FX. Last quarter 2015 in the first quarter, we had a 3% inflation with \u2013 or a strengthening of the peso which actually reduced our tax expense. And in 2016, it was pretty much flat, and so we didn't get that same benefit. So, that kind of masked the underlying growth. But we had very strong growth there and are in a very good and competitive position in Mexico. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. And, Debbie, you mentioned a lot of opportunities in Mexico beyond just the CFE pipelines. Could you maybe comment on, nearer-term, what maybe the best opportunities are that we should be looking at? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. I'll talk about some, and I think one that we have before us that we expect to close during the third quarter is the PEMEX acquisition of the JV assets that we currently hold jointly with PEMEX, and we're still moving forward on that. But as you probably read, now PEMEX is looking at other potential asset sales. And they have a number of assets that we would be interested in that will give us some opportunities. We're also looking at some of the other energy assets that are in Mexico now, some of which are in operations, some of which are in the development stage that we could potentially acquire and we have some that we're looking at there. And then just in terms of the broader markets opening, you have the bids coming out that are about $1.2 billion a piece for electric transmission that we're seeing. You have renewable being bid and several billion dollars worth of potential there. And then for us, since we kind of own and operate pipelines, there's a lot of liquid pipeline assets in Mexico. They are currently held by PEMEX now or needs for new liquids pipeline that deal with their opening of the oil market. And so we think that that's a great area for us as well to have similar type of long-term contracted infrastructure in liquids. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. And my last question, with you guys divesting REX, there's no real domestic midstream presence. Are you looking to grow that through acquisition or organically or is that something that's not necessarily important as long as you have contracted growth in other areas? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. What we've looked at as a strategy to grow that but more on an integrated basis with our other assets. And that when you have a huge load like building an LNG facility, that gives you the opportunity to build pipelines and storage to serve that load that integrate with others, and then to expand those in a way that you can pick up additional customers, whether they're electric generation facilities or manufacturing facilities and really have a full pipeline. So what we tend to look at is where we have a load and we're the one that has that load, whether it's a utility or, it's a \u2013 or a contract with PEMEX or it's a contract for LNG export that we like to have assets that integrate with that load. And so that would be kind of our priority for looking at assets as to how they could be more integrated with our business. I mean, REX is fine, but it didn't integrate with anything we had. We only had a 25% interest in it. We didn't control it. It has contracts expiring. It's just really didn't fit our model. And I don't want that to tell you at all that we're reluctant to get into other midstream assets. We are very interested in getting into those types of assets. But they need to provide us more growth. And when we look at REX, we just did not see the profile as providing the kind of growth. But there's some interesting assets that we're starting to look at now that maybe come on market that we are already in existence, and then there's some that we foresee the need to develop that we think would be really interesting as well. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Hello, guys. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So, I just want to be clear on \u2013 if I were trying to replicate your business plan with my own financial model that we take the balance sheet capacity you have, and we just assume that you buy the shares back at some higher stock price as we compound out four years of growth. And that would be a pretty low implied return on equity on that capital relative to what you would consider a competitive hurdle rate for an actual infrastructure project. Is that a fair articulation of the math? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, Greg. I think you figured that out actually quite well. One of the things we struggled with is that when we do our base plan, the only things we put in our base plan are things we already have contracted and our expected utility earnings and that \u2013 most others, when they build those plans, they put aspirational projects and we don't do that. So then when we looked at that and we thought with all the projects we have at our contracts and what that would yield, and then looking at all the cash flows we have coming from the projects that are in service at that time and what that did to our FFO to debt, we just said, there's no way we would sit with that FFO to debt on our balance sheet at that time. So what's the most conservative assumption we could put in and decided that to do a stock buyback with the most conservative way to handle it. But I'm going to turn it to Joe to talk a little bit more about how you might think about that in your question. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Yeah. Greg, I want to emphasize the two key factors that she mentioned that are the element of the base plan. It's built on the strength of our regulated utilities and the already contracted infrastructure business that contributes to the strong balance sheet and the cash flow. So we did kind of what you said, we looked forward, we had to pick up price, we estimated the price based on a reasonable utility multiple several years out and used that as a way to develop the optional share buyback. And I think that our goal is really to develop infrastructure and beat that. And so the earnings from those projects will replace this and that's the goal that we expect to achieve. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. I would presume once we get to Analyst Day that you would give us a similar framework of, this is what we have on the list of things that are moving ahead. And then the checklist of that aspirational items that we could hold you to either achieving or not achieving as you move through time, much like you did last year? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Absolutely. We'll do the blue box, which is the base plan, and the green box, which is the aspirational items. And I mean, the key thing is that that some of those aspirational items will replace these stock buybacks, obviously. But to the extent that we can do more of those projects, they would also be additive to the stock buyback. And so we'll go through all of that with you at the Analyst Meeting as we usually do. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Switching to Aliso Canyon, the costs obviously are up pretty significantly since the 10-K disclosure of around $330 million, if my memory serves me correctly. Can you give us what the incremental costs have been in basic buckets? Has it been mostly the extension by the judges of the relocation program? Or has it been other items that have also been significant? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Let me \u2013 I'm going to refer this to Dennis so he can kind of walk you through some of that and what's happening relative to the relocation. But the majority of these costs are associated with relocation. The vast majority \u2013 I think it's about 70% of the costs are relocation. So, Dennis, do you want to kind of walk him through that a bit? Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.: Sure. Good afternoon, Greg. You're right. If you think back when we reported in the 10-K, the costs were about $332 million. Since that time, we have had the relocation program extended at least a couple of times by the courts. So if you look at the change of about $333 million, the majority of that has been relocation, a 70%. Then you basically have two other buckets. So about 15% of the overall total relates to the work of stopping the leak, building the relief wells, the root cause investigation that's underway and everything and then you've got the buckets of the other costs related to legal and other out-of-pocket. So, those are the three main 70% relo, 15% for the stopping the leak and the investigation, and then the other 15% related to legal expense and other costs. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you very much. Take care. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. On the TdM asset sale, I suppose that with the sale sort of announced, did that mean it was difficult to get a long-term contract on that plant for sales into Mexico? Is that the genesis behind why this asset is being sold? I thought that this would fall underneath that bucket of assets that could be under a long-term contract, but maybe that wasn't a possibility. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I'm going to have Mark talk about that, but it had been sold into the U.S. previously. And we were working on the possibility of trying to sell it into the Mexican markets. But as we looked at the asset and the difficulty in that, we decided that it was not likely to be not long-term contracted in the near-term. Mark, do you want to... Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the plant right now is configured only for sale into the U.S. We've looked at and we have a plan to connect it into the grid in Mexico. It could be that in the not too distant future that there could be a long-term contract opportunity with the CFE. The CFE did just sponsor and build a new plant very close to our LNG facility in \u2013 down by Ensenada. And so, it's going to delay for some years the need for additional capacity in that region. And also to \u2013 just with those kinds of plants, fossil fuel-fired plants in Mexico, the contracting periods are not as long as they once were and so we started to see that this asset is not likely to meet our kind of long-term contracted objectives and therefore, we thought that we ought to put it on the market and see if we \u2013 and move to sell it. All that said, I think we have certainly a reserve price in our heads that if we don't get it, or don't get it, then we'll rethink that. But I think we're in very good \u2013 we're looking at trying to move forward on it. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, makes sense. And then just going back to Aliso, just want to understand. So, you're saying that you probably won't get any major final report from the agencies until late 2016 or 2017. Are there going to be any initial findings that come out through the regulatory process over the next few months? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, I would say there were some initial findings from DOGGR that indicated that SoCalGas was in full compliance with all the rules that were in place at that time, and DOGGR came out with those findings early on from the preliminary review. But right now, the work that Blade is doing on-site in conjunction with CPUC, I don't think we're going to get any preliminary information. What they'll do is they're gathering the data and then they'll write the report, and it's likely that report will be out at the end of this year or early next year. Dennis, do you want to add to that? Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.: Well, the only thing that I'd add to that, Debbie, is that there's a lot of work going on not just under the root cause investigation with DOGGR, the CPUC, and Blade, but work to get Aliso back up and running. And I can tell you right now that it's really clear that the regulators and policymakers truly understand the importance of Aliso Canyon and gas storage to both gas and electric reliability. So the tone is basically, let's make sure it's safe but let's get it back up and running as quickly as we can. And so far, we've got \u2013 of the 114 wells at Aliso, about 100 wells of them have completed the Phase I inspections and we're transitioning those now to Phase II so that \u2013 our target right now, Faisel, is to have the field ready for full operation obviously subject to DOGGR confirmation. But by late summer, probably late August, so a lot of work going on there. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the storage field would not be able to go back into operation until this report comes out? Or could you put it back into service before then? Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.: Well, today, we've got about 15 billion cubic feet of gas, so if needed, we can withdraw. We're just not allowed to inject until the field has been confirmed ready by DOGGR. And as I said, our current target right now is to have wells ready for re-injection by late summer. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : And that is before the full report will be out. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.: Yeah. And that's separate from the root cause analysis. So those things don't \u2013 they aren't linked. The root cause is going down one work stream and then there's a separate work stream to get the field back up and running. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, makes sense. And then just on REX, just wanted to make sure I understand the \u2013 I guess, what you had initially had in guidance in the past. So, did you always have the legacy REX interest that you have going to zero earnings in 2020? Just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. No, you understood it correctly. I mean, we basically had \u2013 it was de minimis in 2020 because we had looked at the contracts all expiring in 2019, and then there was debt refinancing that needed to be done and so we looked at the economics of that. And so when we were putting our plans together, we were not expecting REX to continue at the kind of run rate that \u2013 we told you that it was $60 million for the 10-month we have this year. We were not expecting it to continue at that kind of run rate after those contracts expired in 2019. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That makes sense. So do you expect the contracts to expire and nothing would happen after that, or did you also \u2013 did you expect some re-contracting but at a lower rate? Did it also include the east-to-west contracts that were signed? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Yeah, we looked at all of that and we expected that there would be some contracting at a lower rate. Mark, do you want to... Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Faisel, yeah, obviously, we did. We had a projection of what we thought the re-contracting rate would be, and then we also assumed that we would continue with the east-to-west contracting that we've done and that we had a market check on that, and that's what was in our plan. But that combined with the interest cost and some refinancing that we thought was going to happen, it just didn't have a material impact on our financials beyond 2018. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, got it. Then last question for me. With the midstream and MLP markets coming back, to some degree, off the bottom, I'm just wondering \u2013 and also with the sale of REX, does this mean the MLP is completely off the table even in the future? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I would say nothing is off the table in the future. I mean, I would never do that. We will always look at what's the lowest cost of capital for us to grow, and that's the way we look at it that \u2013 REX was not a core asset for the MLP anyway since we only owned a fraction of it, and we really didn't have the ability to use that as openly as you would an asset that you had 100%. And I would say Cameron trains 1 through 3 are excellent assets for an MLP. But those would not be off the table, but right now if you kind of look at where that market is, it's certainly not our top priority. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Understood. Thank you, guys. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, I have a couple of them. First of all, Debbie, can you talk about the portfolio and whether you think there's anything else within it that you wouldn't view as core or strategic to Sempra over the long-term? And if so, why? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. No, there's nothing that we identify right now that fits that category, Michael. We look at our assets all the time. And the \u2013 all of our assets or other assets really are pretty well long-term contracted. The only one that comes up that we look at constantly is gas storage and that we do have still contracts on gas storage that have some duration left on those contracts. And we look at that and say how does that fit with our other assets? And what we see happening kind of in the Gulf region with the export of LNG, the conversion of coal to gas and need for different type of assets to support that and then looking at the storage market right now, we kind of think that the timing on that asset, if things aren't going to happen, they're going to get better, not likely worse. And so, that's one we constantly look at but we have concluded on that at least for the time being. It doesn't seem like something that we would want to try to get out of our portfolio at this time. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. When you talk about the $18.5 billion capital plan over the next five years, how much of that is at the two core California utilities? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : It's about $12 billion of that at the two California utilities, so the vast majority of that. And there may be some opportunities \u2013 I was going to say, there may be some opportunities for the utilities to actually consume more of that. There's some projects that we have that are on the green sheets that we show you that we're hoping to get some accrual on that would add to the capital expenditures at the utilities during that time. But we really put in that only the ones that we have some great visibility and high certainty that we either have rate case approval or project approval from the CPUC or FERC. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And last question, how are you thinking about the growth rate in the South American utilities relative to the rest of the Sempra portfolio? I ask only because if I back out the FX impact, it still doesn't seem like it was a huge growth rate and going back over the last couple of quarters as well, just curious how you are thinking about that business and its organic growth potential. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I mean, we still see a lot of organic growth potential there because similar to Mexico, there is huge needs for infrastructure in those countries. And we're looking at quite a few things right now in Peru, in particular. Mark, why don't you maybe hit a little bit about some of the things that we'd looked out and opportunities for growth. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Right. I mean, there is huge infrastructure needs there. I do think both economies, probably Chile more than Peru, but both economies have been affected by the downturn in the mining sector and effectively China's downturn. And so I think that's hurt the overall growth. But I think when you look at them, where they've been historically and what the expectation is for this year and next year, we still see strong underlying growth that you just don't see in any domestic utilities. So, you're seeing \u2013 you still see here the 3%, 4% customer growth and 3%, 4% energy growth coming back. And we \u2013 I think, with the recession, we've had a little bit of a downturn there, but it's \u2013 but we see that coming back. And then on top of that, we see some large infrastructure needs, which really wouldn't be available to us if we weren't active in that market in the utility market there. There, we just wouldn't have a presence to be able to capitalize on those. And so I think we're \u2013 again, we don't put those in our plan because we don't have them signed up yet, but we're close on several things. And I think it looks promising. It looks like that there's definitely some activity level that's going to be happening down there that will increase the growth for those facilities. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, Mark and Debbie. Much appreciated. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Thanks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Michael. Operator : The next is Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hey, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Hi, Debbie. Couple quick questions. First on the assumptions on the rate case. So you highlight that the guidance includes the settlement, including the repair tax treatment. Could you just remind me that \u2013 I recall that not being a big number, but I just want to make sure I know what the number is for the prior repair tax treatment? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Let me have Joe walk through the repair tax treatment numbers for you. Let me talk about the rate case though while he's getting the precise numbers on that. What I would say is on the GRC that we've been given every indication that we should be getting a decision soon. And that we're expecting since we had 8 out of 11 parties sign on to the settlement that we would likely get the settlement as the outcome. We would also expect to get a repair allowance because we feel like we have very strong argument and have differentiated ourselves in terms of how we handle that in our rate cases going forward and returning the benefits to customers. And so we would anticipate getting a decision hopefully very soon and that very consistent with the settlement. And what we've been told is that the hang-up and the delay is not any different than when you're hearing from every utilities commenting on their proceedings is that there's just a lack of resources at the commission right now, especially in the ALJ division, to get some of these things out as quickly as they would like. And so we anticipated that that would come earlier but that we continue to be told it will be soon and that it's really more hung-up because of their resource issues. Okay? Joe? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Hi, Steve. Hey, let me just... Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : ...remind you all. Jeff and Dennis and their teams have been working closely with the commission on this issue, and we've tried to emphasize with them that we have very unique facts that are differentiated from some of the other utilities. And some of those things relate to \u2013 our rate case was actually worked on and closed and officially closed by the ALJ before we made our changes in the tax treatment. And in our 2012 GRC, we offered up a sharing mechanism much like we have in the past, and that was rejected. It was denied. So we've kind of offered up avenues for them to look at this kind of things. And as we've talked about before, there's very good precedent that the savings you generate before next rate case for all kinds of things, tax and general operating \u2013 flow to shareholders. So we think this will be resolved favorably, but let me get to the numbers that you asked about. There's two timing periods that are important. One is up through 2014 and then one is 2015. And I'll talk about the first period first. So from the beginning of the rate case through 2014, the interveners that applied for this suggested that we had about $90 million at each utility that they want to be adjusted through rate base. So that would be a rate base adjustment and the impact, if we lost that, we don't think we will, but if we lost that, the impact would be $6 million to $7 million at each of the utilities kind of going forward because of that change in rate base. But then the commission asked us to put a memorandum account together for 2015 savings from this tax repair allowance. And if we were to lose that issue, we will, of course, appeal it and fight it. But if we were to lose it, we would have to take a charge of about $70 million that's broken between the two utilities, but in total, $65 million to $70 million in total for the 2015 memorandum account. Again, I think these are things that we expect to go in our favor. We're giving you all the data... Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : ... we've done before. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. But I guess the main reason I asked the question is a scheme of a range that's $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. These are pretty small when you look at the ongoing impacts. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Very small. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : They are really not meaningful, so I didn't know why you highlighted it out, because it really doesn't move the needle very much at all. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. It doesn't move the needle at all in the outer years. It was really a 2016 issue because... Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : ... if that decision were to come out in the next couple of weeks and we had a negative result and we didn't want to surprise anybody. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And just on the Aliso, with the changes to the relocation that you set up, could you give us a sense of what the ongoing like weekly cost is? Is there some way to get a sense of that? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Let me hand it to Dennis. I think that one of the things that we need to put in perspective is that we've made a lot of changes to the program that reduced the cost from where it was. And so, Dennis can walk you through including the number of people that are going home now which is quite significant. Dennis? Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.: Hey, Steve. Yeah, let me give you a little color around that because I think as we get some questions, people want to understand and put in perspective. When you look at \u2013 first of all, the leak, as you know, was permanently sealed back on February 18. And at that time, when you look at the number of people that were impacted, it was really \u2013 the vast majority of the households around Aliso Canyon, they never left. They stayed at their homes. Everything was safe and everything. So, it was a smaller number to begin with. But since then, we've had over 54% of any impacted residents that have actually gotten back to their homes, and every week, we're seeing more and more. So, to give you an actual run rate is difficult because, as Debbie said, we're doing things within our program that allow us to \u2013 and help the residents move safe from hotels to corporate-style apartments, more family-situated apartments with kitchens where they can cook and everything, and that helps bring down the cost. The other things that we're doing is we've been offering in-home cleaning services to give further assurance to residents that everything is safe. So, while we haven't given an official run rate, what we can tell you is that the number that we gave out for the $665 million assumed relocation expenses through June 7. And as we said, we expect to get additional information from the Department of Public Health this month regarding their testing. And I think that type of information will even further get people more comfortable that they can go home and we'll see the numbers continue to drop week after week. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And then just very quickly, last question, Debbie, any incremental color to your year-end call on news on Cameron 4? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Let me just ask Mark to address that since we've been having some conversations with Oct\u00e1vio recently about how those discussions are going and actually feel pretty positive about what we're hearing from the customers and the high level of interest. So, Mark? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I \u2013 Steve, thanks. I think the big thing \u2013 the point to keep in mind is as far as U.S. LNG exports go, we believe train 4 will be one of the least expensive options available. So that's why we have \u2013 we continue to have pretty good interest from people looking at securing that option early and maybe even in advance of when world demand may require it. So, we are feeling pretty confident that it's going to move forward. Our original statements that we made on the last call at the end of the year or two were that we expected to have something wrapped up by the end of the year and that our FID amount would be in the first part of next year. And that hasn't changed. So, we're still working towards that. And if we get any indication that things are different, we'll tell you right away. But I think right now, we're still feeling like this will happen sometime this year. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : And then I would add to that just that you all read about what's happening in the markets. And we have great expressed interest from customers. I mean, they're spending time. They're putting teams on this to negotiate with us. So it's not like they're just saying, oh, we like this, do something. They're actually dedicating resources to this. But this is a very challenging market to get agreements signed and so I just want to counterbalance that. And honestly, if we get agreements signed in January or February of next year versus December of this year, I'll be a happy camper. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yes. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : So we're really focused on it. And as I said, it's not like the counterparties are not engaged fully. They are engaged fully. So... Operator : And we'll go next to Rose-Lynn Armstrong at Barclays. Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi. How are you, Rose-Lynn? Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm well. Can you just talk with a little bit greater specificity about the construction progress at Cameron trains 1 through 3? And then separately, regarding the Aliso estimates of $665 million, can \u2013 with regard to the relocation assumption in there, are you assuming that the same number of households are relocating over the entire period? Or is there a decline in trends through June 7? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. Let me take the LNG question first and talk a little bit about that and then have Dennis address the assumptions on the relocation. So for Cameron 1 through 3, we're 43% complete. The construction is going really well. We're all slightly ahead of our construction schedule. I would say on schedule but if you look at some of the data, we're slightly ahead. And that we're still expecting train 1 to come on in March of 2018, train 2 to come on in July of 2018 and 3 in November of 2018 which was the schedule that we had outlined for you previously. So, everything is going very, very well there. I would say the safety performance has been exceptional on the job. And that the major materials, the long lead time materials have all been ordered and everything is moving on quite well in construction. I don't know, Mark, is there anything else you want to add? Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : No. I mean, I think, right now, the project is moving as smoothly as we could have expected. It's in very good shape. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : So, then your second question related to the assumptions that are in the $665 million on the relocation, and let me have Dennis address that. Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.: Sure, Rose-Lynn. Yeah, as I mentioned, what we did is we assumed that the relocation cost would continue through June 7. And we basically \u2013 to be conservative, we've assumed that they stay flat throughout that period. Now, what we are seeing, and this was incorporated into our assumptions, is that as we're cleaning more homes, people are going home. They're being \u2013 they're even more comfortable that their homes are safe and everything. So, we are seeing more and more people go home that way. The other thing that we've been doing that we incorporated into our assumptions is as we're able to locate more of the family-style corporate housing options within the area, we're transitioning more people from hotels where they're also receiving per diem to these corporate apartments where they have their kitchens and we don't have to pay the per diems. So, those are the types of \u2013 and that's part of the program that we have. That's part of the approved program. So, that helps reduce the overall cost as well. So, all those things are built into it, but we aren't assuming a huge drop-off. But we are seeing that on a week-to-week basis, so I think that's favorable. Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : Next, to Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning, guys. How are you? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So, I just wanted to touch base just to revisit Steve's question on the growth rate and the repairs deduction, just to understand this. The impact is roughly \u2013 approximately $70 million in 2016. And then after that it really doesn't have much of a significant impact afterwards. Is that the way to think of it? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Paul, this is Joe. Yeah, that's the way to think of it. But the $65 million to $70 million is not in any of our numbers. We're assuming that we win that, we don't have that impact. So it's really... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Quite right. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : ...if we get a negative impact going forward, there's just really very \u2013 it's not significant, not material. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Just wanted to double-check on that. And then with respect to the $100 million to $120 million of capacity release and the loss that you guys expect to take in the second quarter on that, what would it have been if you \u2013 I mean, this is not completely clear. What is it that \u2013 I mean, you did describe it and I apologize, but what would it have been if you hadn't done that? Would it have just been pro-rated through, what was it, 2019 or something or... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Paul, I said that and so I'll say it again, so it's clear it'll be in the transcript. I said that in our plan, the one that we gave you last year, we had for 2016 and 2017 between $5 million and $10 million of losses related to this capacity because we had a lot of capacity sold forward. It wasn't exactly at the same price we were buying the capacity up. It was pretty close. So, we had a $5 million to $10 million loss for 2016 and 2017. That did not take into account some of the recent financial troubles that some of the capacity holders had. So, if we had kept it, we would have had bigger losses going forward, which is why as we try to sell this forward on a permanent basis, we're taking a bigger loss than you would assume from the $5 million to $10 million that had been in our plan. But for you to go adjust your plans, you were probably basing them off of our numbers, and I want you to know what was in our numbers before which was $5 million to $10 million for the next couple of years. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then the potential buyback, that's kind of a placeholder. And if I understand it correctly, you guys are aiming for better returns with investments and what have you. But the 12% has this as a placeholder in the event that you were for some reason not able to find investments. Is that the right way to think of it? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yes. Paul, that is the way to think about it. What I'd like to emphasize is, look, we're pretty unique here. Most of our peers whether they're utilities or midstream companies or renewable companies are issuing equity to grow. We're actually growing our earnings and our cash flow so fast and increasing the strength of our balance sheet and increasing our dividend 8% to 9% a year over this period that we're able to actually look at a potential buyback if we don't capture some of these projects we're working on, but we fully expect to capture those projects and do better. We just showed this as an optional thing that it's within our control and we can do. That's unique. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So if you were to be able to find the investments, the 12% would be on the lower end of the range? Is that the way to think of it? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Let me just add to that that the 12% is based upon what we already have under contract and in construction. And what our expected utility earnings would be assuming we get the settlement in the rate case and then we just assume in out years that we use attrition in addition to that. So we try to use conservative assumptions for that, but then we show you all the development projects. And in this time, we thought that using the assumption of the buyback was conservative because we wouldn't be sitting there with 22% FFO to debt on our balance sheet and not do something with it. What we fully expect in the next five years that we will have projects that will have a much better return than what we're showing you with the stock buyback. But we have, as Joe said, we have wonderful flexibility. To be able to show you five years what we have long-term contracted that yields that kind of a growth rate and gives us the strength of the balance sheet that gives us the flexibility, if we were not to find projects, to buy back stock, which we don't think is going to be the outcome because we have a robust backlog of projects that we're working on. But it's just a wonderful position to be in and honestly, this is what I was going to talk about at the Analyst Meeting because not too many others can talk about having a strengthening balance sheet, having this type of a 12% growth rate with conservative assumption, and then having the ability to grow the dividend by 8% to 9% over that five-year period of time with nothing else. So, that was going to be a lot of my presentation. I'm (01:07:53) closing kind of what we're going to be talking about, but it's a really great position to be in. And since we didn't do the Analyst Conference, we wanted you to all understand where we stood relative to that, and we'll go into a lot more details as we always do when we get to the conference. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Debbie Reed for any closing comments. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, thanks for all of you joining us today, and as always, if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to contact our IR team. We look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Conference. We will let you know as soon as we get a date scheduled so that you can plan around that. And thank you very much for being understanding with our decision to postpone that. We would not likely have done that, but we also want to do the best job possible in outlining our business. And I think having the certainty of a rate case decision will be a much better position at the end when we really talk to you about the business. So, have a great day and we'll see you sometime hopefully in July. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Snell - Sempra Energy Analysts : Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Operator : Please stand by. Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Second Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's second quarter 2016 earnings call. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas, and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 4, 2016, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. We'll keep our prepared remarks shorter than usual today with a focus on the quarterly earnings as we just held our Analyst Conference. With that, please turn to slide 4. Let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who were able to make it to our Analyst Conference a few weeks ago. We couldn't have asked for better attendance and enjoy being able to talk to you in person and listen to your feedback. Based on our year-to-date results, I will start by reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Joe will review the details of this quarter's results. But first let me take some time to address the strategic goals we have for the Natural Gas business. We previously disclosed the sale of our interest in REX which negatively impacted our quarterly results. We also expect losses in this segment in 2016 and 2017, which are incorporated into our adjusted guidance. Our decision to sell REX reflects an implementation of our strategy for the Natural Gas business to focus our investments around our anchor LNG assets where we have competitive advantages. Oct\u00e1vio discussed this at our Analyst Conference. We also decided to sell our Southeast utilities and TdM and redeploy the capital on assets that better align with our strategy and provide stronger long-term growth. I'd like to spend a minute reiterating the value proposition that we believe is top tier among our utility industry peers and that is a result of Sempra's long-term strategy. First, our strategy continues to provide the building blocks for high total shareholder return. Our base plan projections resulted in an approximate 12% adjusted earnings per share compound growth rate through 2020. Second, we plan to grow the dividend 8% to 9% annually. Third, we have a healthy balance sheet with significant projected credit capacity in the latter years of the plan, which gives us several options to return value to our shareholders. Four, our businesses have great development platforms with a long runway of opportunities. Finally, with those development opportunities, we are committed to our strategy of long-term contracted infrastructure and utility earnings, which moderates risk and provides less volatility in varying market environments. Now, I will turn it over to Joe to review the quarterly financial results. Please turn to slide 5. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259 million or $1.03 per share. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items, at U.S. Gas & Power, we had losses of $19 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with gains of $5 million in the second quarter of 2015, both related to movements of natural gas prices on inventory that we sold forward. We expect the majority of this quarter's losses to reverse by year end, as we sell the natural gas held in inventory. Our goal is to operate this part of the business to lower our economic exposure to commodity price swings. Also at U.S. Gas & Power, we had $8 million of lower equity earnings due to the sale of our interest in REX. At SoCalGas, we had a $13 million impairment as a result of the CPUC decision related to the North-South pipeline. We are now working on ways to recover all or a portion of these expenses, and more importantly, develop alternative solutions for the reliability needs in Southern California that this pipeline was designed to address. Last year, SoCalGas had a $13 million retroactive earnings benefit from higher CPUC rate base approved in the second quarter of 2015. You can find the individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section. Please turn to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned, we took actions in the first half of this year to continue to align our assets with our long-term strategy. And at our California utilities, we received the final general rate case decision. As a result, we made several after-tax adjustments to arrive at adjusted earnings this quarter. The significant adjustments are : first, a loss of $123 million for the permanent releases of pipeline capacity that Sempra Natural Gas held with REX and others; second, $80 million in charges as a result of the final GRC decision for the reallocation to rate payers of certain benefits from tax repairs deductions, and third, also related to the GRC decision, earnings benefits of $21 million for the retroactive GRC effect related to the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, I want to remind you that we expect to report significant gains that will be excluded from adjusted earnings for two transactions when they close, both of which may happen in the third quarter. First, we expect the after-tax gain for the sale of our Southeast utilities to be approximately $70 million. We also expect to record a significant after-tax gain from the re-measurement of IEnova's investment in the shared joint venture with PEMEX upon its acquisition of PEMEX's interest. Regarding this acquisition, we have made progress recently, and we expect to close this year, subject to regulatory approvals. The transaction was restructured earlier in July, and a new price for the seven assets was finalized at approximately $1.1 billion. The sale by PEMEX will be submitted to the regulators for final approval. I'd also like to address Aliso Canyon. We have increased the cost estimate to $717 million, and we have begun collecting under the insurance policies and to-date have received approximately $34 million. On July 25, the individual and business plaintiffs filed an updated and consolidated complaint as required under the case management order. In addition, the County of Los Angeles filed a separate complaint against SoCalGas, a primary component of which seeks new safety measures. Please see our Aliso Canyon status update slide in the appendix, which describes the costs included and excluded from our estimate. And please refer to our 2015 10-K and second quarter 10-Q for more detail on these costs and our insurance coverage. Finally, as Debbie mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Hey, good morning, good afternoon. Hey. So, first question, a little bit more strategic, again, going a little bit back to the Analyst Day commentary. But what's the latest thinking, perhaps, if \u2013 could you elaborate on IEnova and the decision to participate or not to participate both in the sort of an immediate sense and over time, in the equity offerings and maintain your ownership level. Just \u2013 can you elaborate a little bit more on that? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. Let me talk a little bit about, first, the investment opportunities that are there. And we have a lot of things that are coming together now. First of which, we won the Marine pipeline bid in conjunction with TransCanada. And our investment there is about $840 million for that project. And then it appears that the transaction with PEMEX is going to move forward, as we had indicated, and hopefully close by the end of the third quarter, and that's about $1.1 billion. In addition to that, we're looking at some M&A activity, there are some renewables, the second auction is coming up for bid and we have some projects that we're looking at bidding into that second auction. And so, if you kind of look at all of those, that we have several billion dollars' worth of new projects that we're going to be working on over the next few years that we've already secured and several other billion dollars' worth of other projects between the renewables and then the transmission bids that are going to be coming up that are additional opportunities for us. And further than that, we're starting to do some things with the assets we have, like we just built a lateral or got an agreement to build a lateral. We have some others under negotiation off the existing pipelines, so we're looking at how we keep taking the assets that we have and growing those assets. So, it's a great opportunity. I was just with Joe and Mark in Mexico City last week. We spent time down there with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Treasury, the Head of PEMEX, the Head of CFE, Cenagas, and everyone is very enthusiastic about the Mexico infrastructure opportunities. And I will tell you, their view is they're not slowing down because it's critical to what their goal is to have manufacturing in Mexico. So, we're really, really excited about the IEnova opportunities. Going specific to your question, then. What we're going to do, and I can't tell you what position we're going to take on the equity, but we're going to look at all of that, and we're going to look at all of the capital needs. I think we have a couple of hundred million dollars available in Mexico right now. And so, we're going to have to look at the total capital needs that we would expect over the next year or so and then look at what's the right position for us to be in relative to that. We've told you that we're not repatriating because we wanted to take a position in the equity offering, assuming that the equity offering occurs, and we would expect it to occur. So, there's really not a definitive percentage ownership that we've ascribed to. What we'd love to do is have the pie keep getting bigger. And that we don't have to keep our same position in the pie. We don't have to own 80% of the pie. We'd like the pie to be bigger and own a significant position in that pie. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. But is there kind of a point at which, let's say, Cameron IV does or does not move forward that that would potentially evolve as you think about capital allocation, or do you kind of think about it separately and distinctly as what is the return proposition in Mexico not necessarily what happens with the Cameron? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. We're not looking at \u2013 because we think any of these \u2013 all these projects are really good and they're financeable. So, that I wouldn't say that's the consideration but we have some things going on in Peru right now that are very exciting. Potentially, we have the projects in Mexico and then we have the Cameron IV. And so, from a capital allocation standpoint, as we've kind of looked at it that we set up IEnova so that we could issue equity through IEnova. We have the opportunity through our Peruvian company to issue equity. It already has \u2013 it's in the market, and we own like 83% of it. So, if we needed capital for that, we could issue equity in Luz del Sur. And then for Cameron IV, we can issue equity at Sempra for that. So, we have different ways that we can finance these things. And, honestly, if we have great projects that earn significantly above the cost of capital, we have not had an issue in being able to finance them. Further, we showed you at the Analyst meeting, our balance sheet strengthens over the five-year period of time. And so, we put a plug in of $1.5 billion of stock buyback. We would hope to invest that money in good projects, and I think we're going to be able to do that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And one more clarification on the thought process for IEnova, anything around the FIBRA-E structure in Mexico to think about here? Obviously, that's kind of maturing. And what does that mean for you guys, one way or another? I mean, from your tax position in the country, probably, it doesn't mean much, does it? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well I'm going to have Joe answer that. We talked a lot about that when we were in Mexico City last week. A lot of the agencies or PEMEX and all have been looking at FIBRA-E for some of their assets. I mean, I think it offers some opportunity for financing. Again, for us, a lot of it is as it was with the MLP, what's the best cost to capital? So, Joe, do you want to... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Julien. Yeah. We looked at this over a year ago when it first came out, and there were some issues with it, and we worked with the regulators around those. And so, now it's \u2013 I think that's sorted out. But I think it goes back to what Debbie said. What's going to be the best source of capital for us to grow the business? And as she said, we were just down there. It makes us even more excited to own a large part of this business. So, how we decide to fund it with debt and equity, we will take that all into account because these are really great projects, and we really like the growth opportunity there. As to the FIBRA-E, specifically, we just look at that as one of the options we have to grow the business. PEMEX would love to try to do something, but they'd like to see the market kind of open up, and it just hasn't evolved yet. But we stay very close to it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey. How are you? So, looking at where you are for the first half of the year and then understanding that certain things are coming out of the numbers like we won't have REX in the second half, we expect the gas costs to reverse and other puts and takes. Given the line of sight you have right now, do you feel like you're right at the midpoint of the guidance range, a little bit behind, a little bit ahead. Can you give us a sense of how you think you're trending? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : We're not going to pinpoint within the guidance range. That's why we use a range. The things that I think that you mentioned are the things that will take effect over the rest of the year. A few things to consider : usually SDG&E has its best quarter in third quarter, but SoCalGas has its worst quarter because of the way that the revenues are and then has a good quarter in the fourth quarter. So, the earnings are not even throughout the year for the utilities; that the hedged inventory that we talked about should reverse in the second half of the year. We had a North-South impairment at SoCalGas in the quarter of $13 million that hit SoCalGas. That's not something that is repeated again throughout the course of the year. And then the income tax tracking issue at SoCalGas, that was really going retroactive to the beginning of the year. So, that's not a quarterly issue, that's like... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Double. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : ...double, yeah, what it would be. And then last year to this year, we were looking at putting renewables in service last year, where we had a higher ITC. And now, the ITC levels that we're showing are more normalized. So I mean, we look at the earnings that we have are like half of the earnings that we have in our guidance range, and we would anticipate being in the range. And I'm not going to tell you high or low. We're in the range \u2013 that there's a lot of moving parts. But we feel really good about our business and what we're in this for is truly the long-term. And when we start looking at the great opportunities that we have for the growth in addition to what we've laid out in our five-year plan, we feel really good about our business, and that's what we're really focused on delivering. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : No, that's fair. Okay. Can't hurt \u2013 can't harm me for trying. The second question is a little bit off the beaten path. As you are looking to work on the emissions offset and carbon reduction programs that you're putting in place both in the normal course of business and as a result of the Aliso Canyon incident. how significant are some of these programs for methane emission reductions? What are the big buckets of methane-emission reductions that you're going after? And do any of them actually require capital investment where you might look to put those types of programs into the rate base? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. And some of them certainly do. So, let me \u2013 I'm going to refer this to Dennis because he can address both the Aliso but more specifically the methane reductions. SoCalGas has been actively involved working with DOE on this whole methane-emission issue. And I would say that the one thing that SoCalGas has very, very low relative emission levels to other kinds of pipeline systems or upstream systems. But it's something that we've looked at, and we've looked at what investment would be required to really get it down significantly. So, Dennis? Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy : Sure. Good morning, Greg. Yeah. Let me start with what we're doing regarding Aliso, and I touched on this at our Analyst Conference. We've already signed some letters of intent with various dairy owners. And our strategy here is it's consistent with what the Air Resources Board, the plan they put out. But our strategy basically is to look at the destruction of methane, and the biggest opportunities in California are with dairies and/or landfills. So, we're working with some of those owners. We're actually in the process of due diligence on a handful of dairies to see how we can most cost effectively mitigate what resulted from Aliso. From a systems standpoint, as Debbie said \u2013 and we've obviously worked with the American Gas Association and the other trade groups, SoCalGas's emissions from our system itself are some of the lowest in the country. So, we don't see a huge amount of opportunities to be able to make improvements in rate base. But we're looking at new technologies from a monitoring standpoint, for example, that that could be associated that could help us, that those types of things could be added into a rate base in the future. I think that what we see is \u2013 there's just technologies continuing to evolve, and we're on the leading edge of working with those technology manufacturers and the gas industry. So we're going to look at what we can do to try to grow rate base in a smart way that helps improve our system. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. So you're really going after the methane emissions from animal waste? That's really the biggest potential offset? That's interesting. Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy : The biggest potential directly on methane is on dairies. That's correct. And we have quite a few dairies within our service territory especially in the Central Valley, and that's where we're starting to look. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : And there's quite a... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I would say also a couple of things. We put the estimate of that in the $717 million for all the offset for the emissions from Aliso. The emissions have been measured now, and so we're going after making our commitment, fulfilling our commitment of making those offsets. And it's really quite cost effective. So, that is our focus, and we will fulfill that commitment. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you, guys. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from (23:45) Research Consulting. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. I, too, have kind of an off-beat question. By 2020, the rate base of the utilities look like it's going to be about $17 billion, maybe $17.5 billion. Could you give me an estimate on what the non-utility investment total would look like in 2020? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Non-utility investment total. Unknown Speaker : So, investment base. Like a \u2013 similar to the rate base. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Similar to rate base. Okay. And I have the utility projected rate base \u2013 while Joe looks up the non-utility piece, I have the utility piece. And at SDG&E, we're looking at about $10.4 billion of rate base in 2020, and that's about 6 bps being (24:43) about 4.4 (24:44). And then for SoCalGas, the rate base that we're looking at for 2020 is about $7 billion, and then about $5.1 billion of that is CPUC, and about $1.9 billion of that is more special projects approved by the CPUC that's not part of the rate case. And then... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. (25:04), this is Joe. I think you're asking a question about something that we typically don't give out, but it's probably information that's here, and we can catch up with you on the call after because you're asking about what's the total invested capital outside the utilities, you're not asking what the investments for that year are, correct? Unknown Speaker : That is correct. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. We can do it offline. I don't have that information at our fingertips. We don't usually talk about our total invested capital outside. I mean, you can see it on the balance sheet pretty easily. But it's more complex than I think we would take time here with everybody, because we're not... Unknown Speaker : Agreed. Okay. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : And \u2013 the utility assets are much bigger than their rate base. There's a whole bunch of things that are in there. You got nuclear decommissioning trust and all sorts of things. So, we need to parse it out for you, and it's in the segment tables. So, the information is there, but we could lead you to it. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And the other question is the non-utility businesses, so natural gas, LNG, pipeline. On a risk basis compared to utility \u2013 let's say, you \u2013 the risk in utility businesses is 100 units. What would you characterize as the risk for all of your other businesses combined? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean, that's a really difficult comparison. What I will tell you is that our strategy is based upon having a portfolio that has similar risk profiles between our utility and our non-utility business, and we do that by doing long-term contracts. And if you look at our non-utility businesses, they're either \u2013 our international businesses are either foreign utilities that have been under a regulatory framework for 30 years, or they are long-term contracted assets like our pipelines. And so, we have 20-year to 25-year contracts on those. Most of those assets \u2013 honestly, when you look at it, once they go into service, they're more like a bond, because you have a steady stream of earnings coming from those. And the construction risk on those projects is not much different than the construction risk that was on building Sunrise. So, I would say they're very similar and that's our strategy, is to not go into extremely high-risk areas to create the growth but to have our risk profile be quite similar. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Debbie, I'll just add on to that. (27:46) the other thing you could look at is, if you look at the slides that we did at the conference just a few weeks ago and look at slide 7 in my deck, it talks about the investment grade credit ratings at all of our subsidiaries. And these are all highly-rated, mostly A rated, including Cameron and \u2013 while we don't have ratings on all the project financing at the renewables, as Debbie said, they're all contracted long-term with utilities. Kate and I just spent a good deal of time last summer with all the rating agencies explaining to them why our non-utility businesses were as strong or stronger than our utility businesses because we don't have three-year rate cases or four-year rate cases, we have long-term contracts. And so, they like that very much and they understand our business very well. I think it's very strong. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Just a little bit of question. I want to make sure I understand trajectory of earnings within your 2016 guidance and even for 2017 just across the quarters. It strikes me that when you all have talked about this a little bit that there's going to be some significant movement around kind of what to expect versus a typical or historical year at both of the utilities in third versus fourth quarters going forward. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean, what \u2013 last year was the first year for SoCalGas. We had the new way of accounting for revenue. So, that kind of gives you what percentage of the revenues come out each year. And they're just allocated on that kind of a percentage basis. And so, that should follow suit. And then SDG&E, we've historically reported earnings based upon the same methodology. And so, you can kind of look at what percentage of earnings usually fall within a quarter. So, if you look at last year, those are pretty regularized in terms of how the earnings get allocated by quarter and we can give you the precise percentages for SoCalGas if you want those. I mean, but this quarter, we obviously had a lot of unique things because we had the REX transaction, we had that capacity release, we had the change in the rate case, the rate case decision coming out, the impact of the taxes from the rate case decision. So, there were a lot of things that occurred this quarter. Next quarter, we're going to have a lot of things occurring as well. And we tried to foresee that and communicate that because we should have a close of Mobile and Wilmut happening some time at least by the end of this year. And then, that we will have, also by the end of this year, most likely the PEMEX transaction closed. And so, both of those will have gains that would be adjusted out of adjusted earnings. Hopefully, once we get through some of that. The other thing we have, we have TdM as an asset held for sale, and depending on the sales process on that. And earlier this year, we took a $26 million hit in terms of deferred taxes for holding that for sale. So, we've had a lot of things because we're really trying to go through and take our asset portfolio and cleanse it of things that we don't think are going to add to our growth in the long term and then reinvest our capital. Hopefully, you'll start seeing more normalized kinds of earnings going forward since we have now pretty much accomplished that plan with the exception of getting some of these things closed. And I don't know if that helps you at all. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No. That helps a ton. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Real quick. As you think about strategic positioning of existing assets, where does your Gulf Coast-related gas storage facilities fit into this? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. As we look at those, Michael, one of the things that we really have already started seeing as some of the LNG facilities have come online is that those storage assets, we think, will have more value over time. And that we think that really to run an LNG facility, it makes sense to have storage. There was a situation that just happened last week where Cheniere was cut back on their pipeline capacity, and that you cannot cut back an LNG facility like that. So, what we're looking at, we haven't put any money in terms of developing those yet. We think as the LNG facilities come online in the Gulf that the need for storage adjacent to facilities will become a lot more apparent, and that \u2013 and this is part of our strategy. We're hoping to develop some of the storage facilities and some adjacent pipelines to serve Cameron, other LNG facilities that are in the area, manufacturing that's in the area, and then that Port Arthur when that gets developed. So, we think that there's going to be a need for more robust infrastructure in that Gulf Region as the LNG comes on. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: When do you expect to economically benefit from higher storage pricing? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, we actually \u2013 when we did our work this year, we looked a lot at that, and we used outside firms. And we actually cut some of their forecasts when we did our own projections this year because they're projecting that as the LNG facilities come online that \u2013 and as you get more of the coal-to-gas conversion that you're going to start seeing some storage rate increases occurring. But what we've seen in reality is it's been slower than what their projections have been. So we took at conservative view in our plan. But we are starting to see \u2013 year-to-year, we're starting to see some price movement upward from where we were last year. Not huge amounts, but we are starting to see some upward movement in pricing. So, I think as more load comes on that we'll start seeing better storage rates. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Debbie. Thank you, Joe. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Just... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Debbie. A question on Aliso. Could you give us an update on your well testing? And what your latest thought is on when maybe some of the first wells could start coming back into operation? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure, Steve. I'm going to have Dennis address that because he's right in the middle of that now. So, Dennis? Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy : Hey, Steve. Yeah. As of right now, we've completed the first series of tests on all 114 wells. And as of this morning, the Division of Gas, Geothermal Resources and Oil (sic) [Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources] (34:47) has approved and reviewed 96 of those wells. So, they have all gone through the process. Out of the 96, we've had an additional 17 wells that have gone through the next series of tests and they've passed and they've been reviewed by DOGGR. So, out of the 114, 17 have been completely cleared by DOGGR. So once DOGGR and the Public Utilities Commission confirm that the entire field has met the requirements of the new law, SB 380, we believe that probably sometime in September, we'll be ready to start injection, subject to their approval, of somewhere between 20 wells and 25 wells. So, that's our best estimate right now. In September, we'll \u2013 later, maybe as early as perhaps later this month, we'll be going back to DOGGR asking for that approval, but they've got to go through a process with public hearings. So, September is our best estimate at this point in time. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yep. Operator : Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just really quickly, on the permanent release impairment is there any longer term impact to earnings associated with that? Any benefit from reduced cost or something like that? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Let me have Mark talk about the capacity release. Most of it was tied to the REX transaction. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Right. Paul, I think to understand your question, I don't think there's any significant reduction in expense going forward tied to that release. It's a pretty small team that was managing it. And also, with respect to the release, there won't be any ongoing P&L impact now that it's done. So, I think the answer to your question is no, there's no really ongoing effect. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I would just add to that. The decision to do this was largely looking at what the value of that capacity was going to be over time, and it was devaluing in comparison to what we had assumed it was going to be valued at. And we wanted to get that behind us. We had some credit issues on REX that were there. There was some shaky credits in addition and that we just felt it was better to get, when we sold REX, to get all of that behind us and not have a tail risk associated with that pipeline, so. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, just to follow up on Aliso. So, you guys mentioned the $717 million update and the receivable what have you. But there were some things I guess that that cost estimate excludes. Do we have any sense as to what the neighborhood of those cost estimates that may be excluded are and what the insurance coverage of that is, do you follow me? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : What I am going to say is that, we've included everything that's estimable. And that's the $717 million includes all of the well costs, it includes all the relocation costs, it includes the cost for Blade [Blade Energy Partners] to do the investigation. All of those kinds of costs that are estimable. What's not estimable is what happens on litigation. And we don't know what that would be. I would say, the good thing is that we've paid for relocation. We have offered people to be out of the area. We tried to do things to reduce damages and then further, the Department of Health Services has come out repeatedly and most recently after thorough investigation of the homes and testing and all and said that there were no long-term health effects from this. And so, how that all plays out in litigation, we can't estimate that. But what we tried to do is to put this in a box to the extent possible and ensure that we've managed the risk effectively. And so, we'll go forward with the litigation. But I think from the basis of the estimates that we have over $1 billion of insurance, and that we continue to believe that the \u2013 with what we see, that the insurance coverage is adequate for the damages. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Since there are no further questions then, I thank you all for joining us, and I thank you all for being at the Analyst Conference. It was great seeing you in person. And if you have any follow-up questions, please contact our IR team. And have a really wonderful day. Thanks a lot. Operator : That will conclude today's conference. Thank you all, once again, for your participation.",

(Broker) Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Operator : Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Third Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section. With me in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas; Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of SDG&E and Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, President of Sempra LNG. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to indicate that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 2, 2016, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Rick. During the third quarter, our strong operating and financial performance continued across the company. Our third quarter financial results keep us on track to achieve our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. I would like to start off with an update on Cameron LNG. Last week, Cameron JV's EPC contractor gave indication that the project is facing delays. Cameron JV and the partners are assessing the information. Any delay would likely cause 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings to be lower than anticipated, but those earnings would be made up over time. Most importantly, our NPV should be substantially maintained as the tariff adjusts as a result of the delay. I will go into further details in a moment. Moving on to other important elements of our base plan, I'm pleased to say that since our Analyst Conference in July, our team has been successfully executing on our projects. At IEnova, we have closed the approximately $1.1 billion acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the joint venture and issued $1.6 billion of follow-on equity. At the California utilities, we continue to make progress on our $12 billion five-year capital plan. Most recently, the CPUC has approved the Sycamore-Pe\u00f1asquitos electric transmission project at SDG&E. We've also made progress on securing development opportunities that can enhance our value propositions. At IEnova, we plan on adding approximately 400 megawatts of new renewable projects. At SDG&E, we received CPUC approval to own and operate 37.5 megawatts of energy storage that we expect to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2017. Now, please turn to slide 5. Let me start with an update on Cameron Trains 1 through 3. Last week, Cameron JV received indication from its EPC contractor, that the in-service date for each train may be facing delay. The contractor's information reflects updated in-service dates as follows : mid-2018 for Train 1; late-2018 for Train 2; and mid-2019 for Train 3. Sempra and our partners are assessing this new information and ways to mitigate any impact. We are disappointed with the short-term delay, because at Sempra, we take great pride in delivering projects on time and on budget. But under a lump-sum turnkey construction agreement, the contractor retains the responsibility and overall control of the project schedule. The good news is that EPC contract does provide for liquidated damages for certain delays. Those damages would be factored into the tariff and would alleviate some of the impact to Cameron's customers. As a reminder, our JV partners are also our customers. The terms of our agreements provide that EPC schedule delays and changes in costs results in tariff adjustments. The adjustments are designed to substantially maintain the expected NPV on the project. Therefore, delays are not likely to impact the project's overall NPV. However, any construction delays would likely defer a portion of 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings. We had originally anticipated all three trains being in service by the end of 2018. To give you a sense of the impact, Sempra's expected quarterly earnings from the project when all three trains are in service in 2019 are approximately $80 million. Moving to Cameron Train 4. Any expansion of Cameron beyond the first three trains requires unanimous consent from our equity partners. One of the partners has indicated they do not want to invest additional capital for an expansion. Discussions among the partners have been going on for several months, and we are considering a variety of options that may result in a clearer path to an expansion. Although we can't project timing until we receive the necessary approvals, we continue to believe a Cameron expansion would be well positioned as one of the lowest-cost sources of global LNG supply. As a reminder, LNG expansions had never been part of our base plan. Now, please turn to the next slide for an update on IEnova. We are proud of our recent accomplishments in Mexico. Our new investments in IEnova are underpinned by dollar-based long-term contracts consistent with Sempra strategy. They enhance Sempra's Mexico's value of proposition by diversifying its growth platforms and customer base. IEnova recently completed the purchase of PEMEX's 50% equity interest in our shared joint venture. In October, IEnova raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on equity issuance, primarily to finance the PEMEX acquisition and other growth. The equity offering was the largest follow-on deal in Mexico in the last two years. It was substantially oversubscribed and priced at a 5% premium to the launch of marketing. Sempra purchased $351 million of IEnova stock and now owns approximately 66% of the company. The strong deal showing is market confirmation that we have been successful with our strategy in Mexico. In September, IEnova announced nearly 400 megawatts of additional renewable projects that are in addition to the base plan. This includes the acquisition of the 252-megawatt Ventika wind facility. Ventika went into service in April of this year and is the largest wind farm in Mexico. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. And 141 megawatts of solar capacity awarded in Mexico's second renewable auction. Operations are scheduled to come online in the first half of 2019. We continue to see a large amount of growth opportunities in Mexico that fit our strategy. Now, please turn to slide 7 for several other business updates. As noted in the press, we are working on an agreement to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Peru Pipeline project. It is an approximately $6.5 billion natural gas pipeline. We are hopeful an agreement can be reached, but there is no assurance and we are still resolving several significant issues. We are not able to comment on this further at this time. Moving on to Aliso Canyon. SoCalGas has made significant infrastructure technology and safety enhancements to the facility. We are continuing the process to resume injections by requesting authority from DOGGR and the CPUC this week, which could be approved by year-end. Regarding the root cause analysis, we expect to receive the final report sometime in the first half of 2017, but the timing is dictated by DOGGR, the CPUC and Blade Energy. Next, we've settled the only criminal suit with the LA County District Attorney's Office for approximately $4 million. The settlement covers a small fine and penalty and enhancements to safety and methane monitoring at the site. The settlement is still subject to court approval. Also, if you'll recall, we previously stated our insurance coverage was over $1 billion. We are now providing a more precise range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We have received a total of $94 million of insurance proceeds to-date. The total cost estimate has increased to $763 million. The increase is primary related to updated cost estimates for the third-party root cause analysis and the claims recovery process associated with the temporary relocation program. Please refer to our third quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on the costs included and excluded from our estimated cost and our insurance coverage. Before I hand the call over to Joe, let me discuss the management changes we recently announced. Mark Snell is going to retire in March of 2017. Although we are sad to see Mark leave, we appreciate his many contributions to Sempra. We also announced several other management changes as part of our succession planning. One of our strengths is the ability to develop an experienced and diverse leadership team. We strive to identify talented leaders within our organization and expand their experience across different areas of our business. These management changes are part of our succession planning process to ensure all leadership transitions can be made smoothly with no disruptions to our business. With that, I will hand it over to Joe for his last time as CFO to review the quarterly financial results, starting on slide 8. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $622 million, or $2.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $259 million, or $1.02 per share, compared to third quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $248 million, or $0.99 per share. This quarter, we have three adjustments to GAAP earnings. First, as Debbie mentioned, we completed the acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the GdC joint venture and recorded a gain of $350 million, which represents the step up in value of our previously existing ownership interest. Second, U.S. Gas & Power closed the sale of its southeast utilities and recorded a gain of $78 million. And finally, as part of the TdM sales process, additional market information became available this quarter that required us to reconsider its current book value. As a result, we recorded a net $65 million non-cash charge at Sempra Mexico. All three of these items are excluded from third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings and our 2016 adjusted guidance. I'd like to point out that this quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation, resulting in a benefit of $34 million retroactive to January 1, 2016, which is reflected in the results for the nine months that had no impact on third quarter results. Please turn to slide 9, and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items. At the California utilities, we had $21 million of higher earnings, primarily due to higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses. Sempra International had $13 million of lower earnings, including a $4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency transactional effects, and inflation in the current year, compared to a $16 million favorable impact in 2015 as a result of significant devaluation of the Mexican peso versus the dollar in 2015. This was partially offset by $5 million of higher operational earnings in Mexico and Peru. I would also like to mention an item that didn't impact this quarter, but it could moving forward. Now that we have closed the PEMEX JV acquisition, we have larger deferred tax balances in Mexico. This increases our exposure to Mexican peso movements in the future. You can find individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings Section. I will wrap up by going over a few of our highlights. Based on our financial results, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is $5 per share to $5.40 per share. Our primary focus as a company is executing on our base plan. We had a strong quarter with IEnova closing the PEMEX JV acquisition and completing a $1.6 billion equity issuance. We are also working to drive additional growth with new development opportunities. Just this past quarter, additional battery storage was ordered at SDG&E and approximately 400 megawatts of renewable projects were announced at IEnova. Incremental projects like these that fit our strategy can enable us to grow during and beyond the five years of our base plan. With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. So, quick question, following up on the LNG piece first. Can you elaborate a little bit of what the impact is to 2020? Just \u2013 if you suggest that the NPV remains the same, does that mean the tariff is actually adjusting up the NPV for you? And so, what does that mean for EPS? And then secondly, can you elaborate a little bit on the nature of the delay? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Let me try to just give a little more color around the situation. We received notice last week of this, and what they indicated when they gave us notice was just the in-service dates that they anticipated were the three trains that I went over in the prepared remarks that that will be Train 1, mid-2018; Train 2, the end of 2018; and Train 3, mid-2019. They didn't give us any indication officially of the cause of the delay, but on their call, they indicated that there has been rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge. And apparently, they have some flooding, particularly at their fabrication facility. In terms of 2020, we're not going to revise any guidance for 2020 at this point. Obviously, we have a lot going on between this and potential of the Peruvian pipeline. And so, we're not going to do any update to guidance. But we try to give you an indication as kind of the economics of the three trains \u2013 of all three trains that are operating. And what this delay would be, because we had said previously we expected all three trains to be in service by the end of 2018. So, I think with what we've given you, you could kind of calculate what you would anticipate. In terms of the NPV, and this is very important, the way the tariff works is that the IRR was established that when we signed the contract for the project. And at the end of construction of the first train, then all of the assumptions are trued up, what the capital costs are and then what the amount is of the toll in order to maintain the IRR that was agreed upon. And so, that will occur. And then, so we will collect those dollars to achieve the same NPV on the project as we would have, had it gone in service on the originally planned day. And the toll actually goes up in future years as the way that it's calculated. But this will cause a delay in 2018 and 2019 earnings, as I stated in my comments. I hope that was clear, Julien. Was that helpful? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Absolutely. Thank you. And then just quickly, if you can actually, on the Peru piece. I know you don't want to comment too much, but what is the nature of the, I think, \"significant issues\" that you're resolving? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, that mean, there's commercial issues that are in the final stages of resolution. And then, we will have a number of conditions precedent if we can reach conclusion of the commercial issues in order to be sure that we have done the kind of diligence we want on the assets. And so, I would not at all say that this is near a done deal, but we're working on it. There's still meetings going on. And so, we're hopeful but we're also cautious. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Absolutely. Thank you very much. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Just to clarify your answer to Julien on the IRR, so it doesn't sound like it would have a material accretive impact on any one given year, given that you probably \u2013 one presumption would be that you just have an increase in the levelized toll over the course of the life of the contract in order to get back to your IRR. Is that a fair way to think about it? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : That's a fair way to think about it. And then when you calculate the NPV with the delay or without the delay, it ends up being basically the same number, close to the same number. And so, that's exactly what happened. So, it increase earnings in future years as a result of a delay. And the same thing happens if there's an increase in project costs then the toll gets adjusted. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. At what point would you be in a position to start to get liquidated damages? Are you implying that a six-month delay does not tip you into that zone in the contract, but a further delay would? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Liquidated damages would apply depending on what the source of the delay is. And that's one of the things that is going to be a subject for discussion. As I said, we just got this notice last week. And the partners have not had the opportunity to sit down with CB&I and Chiyoda, and really understand what is the source of the delays, what can be done to mitigate some of those delays. None of those discussions have occurred since this notice came last week. Those will be occurring in the next several weeks. I will say many of us visited the site last week. Construction is progressing and that there's a lot of work that's been done on the site, but until we really sit down and understand what's driving some of the schedule changes, it's too early to speculate what the liquidated damages would be. But the contractor does have delay liquidated damages as part of their contract. And those go against capital cost for the project in reducing capital cost, so that's the way it works. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got you. What was your peso exposure before and what is it now? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I'm going to have Joe address that in terms of the change with the \u2013 I think you're talking about looking at the change now with the acquisition of the... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : In other words, before the deal, what was your exposure to a given change in the exchange rate and what is it now? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Hi, Greg. So, what we wanted to do here is make sure that everybody had the visibility into the fact that we have monetary assets and liabilities and we have deferred taxes. And because the tax system calculates all of our taxes in pesos, these dollar-denominated items, when they're converted to pesos, obviously, can move. And so, we see some impact of that. Over the last number of years, it's generally been a pretty close push between what was happening if the currencies are all moving in the same direction, what's happening in Chile, Peru and Mexico kind of offset each other. What we've wanted to explain is because we have more deferred taxes now, because we're acquiring the other half of this joint venture, our exposure to peso-dollar movement will move on that deferred tax liability and some of our monetary assets and liabilities. It's hard to predict because, obviously, we would have to forecast what the effect of the dollar-peso movement would be over the course of the year. Last year, we actually had a positive, a significant positive benefit to earnings because of this. Just to remind everybody, we do hedge our current tax liabilities. So, if there's a cash impact, then we hedge that to make sure we don't have a cash impact, but we don't hedge the deferred tax liabilities because it's just an accounting item that moves up and down and that would be costly to do. So, I can't give you a precise number. What we wanted to give you some visibility into is, we've been saying for the past five years or so, that we have a natural hedge between Chile, Peru and Mexico when the currencies are moving in the same direction against the dollar. Now, it'll be a little bit more tilted to Mexico. It can move up and it can move down and it will. And so, there'll be a little bit more exposure, but again, it's a non-cash exposure. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got you. Final question. Can you give us what the earnings impact is of the renewable energy projects on page 6 that you won are relative to the base case that you gave out at Analyst Day? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No. We don't \u2013 I mean, we don't give project-by-project earnings. What we'll do is when we give you our updates on the February call for 2017, and then we give you our update at the Analyst Conference for 2018, we'll give you that information as part of our adjusted projection. So, we don't do them by projects. But they're the same. What I would say is, our renewable projects are all like high single-digit returns and that, this is about 400 megawatts in total of the adds that will come in over the next three years or so. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : When you say returns, you're meaning return on equity, IRR? How should \u2013 something like that? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Non-levered IRR. Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Sticking with Cameron Trains 1 through 3 for a second. I just wanted to understand maybe some context with other larger projects that you guys have done in the past and any issues that you might have had there? When you see something like this kind of get announced by the contractor this early in the process and taking the consideration that you have built in kind of time and cost contingencies into the overall package so far, where do we shake out here, is this the contractor being especially conservative and maybe there's a chance down the road that they get back on schedule or is this kind of a sign of something even worse to come? And then just a point of clarification as well on the kind of NPV staying whole, are you guys being made whole for that if the contractor is not responsible then just I guess, mathematically, it would be the counter-parties that are absorbing all of that potential risk, if that's correct? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Okay. Let me try to address \u2013 I think there were multiple questions in there, so let me try to address those. If you look at the delay notice, like I said, we just got it last week. We have not had the opportunity to sit down with the contractor and discuss, we'll be doing that within the next week or so. What I will say, though, is that the project is about 57% complete in total. And all the materials are on site for the construction. We were there last week. All of the cooling units were on Train 1. I mean, there's been a lot of construction progress and so it's not like early \u2013 not really early on, I would say, in the progress of the project. And it's the contractors' responsibility when they feel that there is a potential for a delay to give us those notifications and that's what they did just last week. As I said, all we know is that on their call, they said that there was rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that caused some flooding. We don't know what the actual cause of the delay is, until we get in and have a chance to have them explain to us what they're looking at, and then look at what the potential is to mitigate some of those. It's really hard for us to assess the likelihood of it getting better through those discussions, but we'll be making every effort to have that occur. I'm not sure if I answered all of your questions with that. I think there was one other thing that I might have missed, but... Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : About the NPV... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : NPV. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : ...if it's not the contractor, does it go to a customer? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. And it does go through the toll to the customers. And that was the agreement that was established, that all of the LDs (28:08) would go against the capital cost which would also reduce the toll to the customer. So, to the extent there's a delay that's caused by the contractor, the customers benefit from that in a reduced toll, because it reduces capital cost, but to the extent that there's a delay and that that increases the toll. And that's the way we designed it. Everyone was full knowledge. I mean, part of the thing that's actually very good is that when we did our contract, we really tried to mitigate the risk for Sempra in terms of the long-term value of this project. And so, we set it up to where we were not the ones that bore the risk for these things. And that the NPV of the project remain the same and that the contractor has responsibility for delay. And the contractor has a lump sum turnkey contract. The only way that they can increase cost is by change orders. So, that was the design of the project, to really mitigate the risk long-term to our shareholders. And I think it's showing that it's pretty effective in doing that in the long-term, while it may affect some of the shorter term. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : I think it's important, too, to have perspective about over four-year construction project starting when we took up ID (29:25) in 2014 and going through now. And this is moving from their information to us, a fairly small amount in terms of that, but we wanted you to all understand what the impact could be to some of the earnings numbers that we've given you, because even though it's a small percentage on the construction timeline, we wanted everybody to see the visibility to that. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that extra clarity there. That's helpful to hear. And then just on the Peruvian project, I understand that you can't give us much in the way of detail around the negotiations right now or kind of maybe the timing of that specifically. But were you to be successful, would this require Sempra level equity and what would that mean in terms of the current plan to end the repatriation of cash at the end of, I think, 2018? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : All I can tell you on that is, those are all things we're looking at right now and looking what the alternatives are. And that, until we know if we have the project and we know what it would cost and we know what the cash flows are going to be on it, it's really difficult to give any speculation. I'm not going to speculate on that. When we update our numbers, you'll see some of that. And we will \u2013 if we get the project, then our numbers will be updated when we do the call on the Analyst Conference. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And that was something where previously when you were negotiating for that a couple of years ago, you hadn't given any numbers out at that time either? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. And, no, we haven't given any numbers. We don't give numbers if we don't \u2013 until we know we have something, until we know how we're going to finance it, and that we have some confidence in the numbers. So... Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's clear. Thanks, guys. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks. Operator : We will go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Most of my questions have been hit on. I just wanted to discuss Aliso Canyon. You've given an updated insurance range. I wondered if you could just talk at a high level as to what caused the adjustment to that range. And then, sort of related, when you look at all the claims, how are you generally feeling in terms of ability of your insurance to cover those claims? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. We're still feeling good about our insurance ability to cover the claims. And when we looked at \u2013 we looked at our reserve on an ongoing basis, based upon new knowledge of cost. One of the key things that caused our estimate to go up is the work that's being done on the root cause analysis and the fact that the third parties that are doing work on that are expecting a delay. And with the expectation of a delay in getting the outcome there, we would expect the cost to be slightly higher. And so, we took that into account. And then the other thing is, we're going through now recovery with our insurance on all the relocation expense, and validating all of the claims, so we have full insurance recoverability. And that \u2013 and going through that, that has taken a lot more detail type of work to get the claims ready, and so we included some of the costs associated with that. Those were the two drivers for the change in cost. I will say, these costs will be updated over time though, as we get into litigation, as we get into \u2013 knowing what legal costs we're incurring and knowing what litigation claims, any settlements that have been reflected with parties on any of the potential claims, fines or penalties, or other claims. As an example on this reserve, we did reach a settlement with the LA County DA, District Attorney, on the criminal charges and reached a settlement on that. And so, once we could quantify that, then that goes into the reserve number that we give you. So, those are the kinds of things that would continue to flow through in updates of that reserve. We've also spent, though, time looking at our insurance. And looking at what the types of claims we have, the types of claims that have been filed and what the insurance coverage is and being able to refine that a bit. And so, we're able to give you kind of a better estimate of what the range of insurance we believe is available. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's all I have. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. I just want to understand with the delay in Trains 1 through 3, does that affect the marketing at all of Train 4? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Not directly, but I think indirectly in that, in order to go forward with Train 4, we need a few things. We need our partner consent. And as I said, we're working with one of the partners to try to get their consent. They've decided to not put equity in. And so, we're trying to look at how we would structure to move forward without them contributing equity, and have been having numerous ongoing discussions and communications with them about trying to resolve that. The other thing is, we need lenders' consent to move forward with Train 4. And the lenders are going to want to see that we've made reasonable progress on Trains 1 through 3, before giving that. So, that would be how I would see it having some impact, but it's not a direct impact. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got it. And then, on the renewable projects in Mexico. I'm just trying to understand at a high-level, just trying to understand the potential growth in the renewables business within Mexico. Is the transmission system within the country well-developed enough to sort of handle all this wind and some of these solar projects coming online? I'm just trying to understand if these megawatts make it to market or are we getting too far ahead of ourselves before the transmission's developed? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Actually, that was one of the things that we looked at very carefully when we looked at \u2013 the one we acquired is already in operation. So, the transmission is there. And the two projects that we bid on, the solar projects that we won, we looked very carefully at what the transmission was, and we were very selective on what we bid based upon that. But there's great opportunity in transmission in Mexico. They're expecting two bids to be out within the next \u2013 in 2017 that would each be about $1.2 billion for transmission upgrades to their system. And that's a great opportunity for IEnova to participate in those bids. I think you will see a lot more. As you've seen in other markets where renewables start getting integrated, I think you will see a lot more investment in electric transmission occurring in Mexico. But, in the near-term, they've already announced those two bids. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got you. And then you guys' decision to participate in the equity offering, the amount that you guys decided to take down the equity offering, was there some calculus behind that in terms of how you came to that amount? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I'm going to ask Joe to talk about that, because there was some \u2013 a lot of thought about where want it to be and where we want to position ourselves for now. But I'm going to ask Joe to address that. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Faisel. Yeah. We said last year when we announced the deal for the PEMEX JV that we would basically take two years of the dividend flows from IEnova to us, hold those in our Mexican holding company and reinvest that. And we said it would probably be in the $300 million to $350 million range. And Mark and I spend a lot of time with Carlos talking about how much we should take. We got a lot of advice from our IEnova investors of how you guys should maybe not do it, we want to own more. So, definitely there was a lot of demand for this equity which was great. The roadshow was very similar to the IPO. We got a lot of orders every day and it was a really amazing roadshow with the investors. At the end of the day, we wanted to make sure, because we really love these assets and this business that we maintained a strong ownership interest in it. And so, we kind of went to the max, because we were actually issuing more equity than we originally put on the table when we started the roadshow and upside to that amount. So, we did about the top end of what we said we were going to do. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got it. And then just on Aliso, I mean, is it possible \u2013 can the in-service date or the return of the service of the storage facility, can that be before the root cause analysis is done or do we have to wait for that to get done? I'm just trying to understand if there's \u2013 if that can actually happen before there's a resolution. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. It can happen before the root cause analysis is done. Let me have Dennis kind of walk you through what the process is that DOGGR and the CPUC will use over the next month or so. As we did make our filing yesterday to put the field back in service and for DOGGR and CPUC to do the certification that's required. So, Dennis, do you want to kind of walk... Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy : Sure. Hi, Faisel. Yeah. When the new law SB 380 was put in place, it was put in \u2013 it was established independently of when the root cause analysis was going to be completed. There are basically two different tracks there that we've complied with everything that's required under \u2013 we believe, under SB 380 and that's why we made the filing yesterday. So, the process now is that DOGGR and the Public Utilities Commission are going to be reviewing all of the data and the information that we submitted. They're required under the law to hold a public hearing, which they have to give 15-day notice to. And we expect that sometime soon, they'll establish the date for that and they'll go through the process. But as Debbie mentioned, they are independent tracks all together, the root cause analysis, as well as the satisfaction of the comprehensive safety review that's laid out in SB 380. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. That makes sense. I just want to wish Mark well in his retirement in case I didn't get a chance... Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): ...to talk to him before the next quarterly call. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Okay. Operator : We will go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Hi, Debbie. I know you don't have specifics on why the six-month delay, but could you maybe just \u2013 is there a way you can make us more comfortable that six months doesn't turn into 12 months or 18 months? Could you talk about that or less, but why should we be worried about it being more? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean, I think that if you look at where construction is now, a lot of the major pieces of construction have been done. And some of the issues that were the most critical that have more time sensitivity dealt with all the foundational work, and that's all been done. So, I mean, I think when you see the progress, and some of you will see the progress when you visit the facility, you'll get a sense that the work is moving forward, it's up to the contractor to give us their best estimates of the timeframe, and it's probably not in their interest to give us something that they don't feel like they're going to be able to meet. And so, at this point in time, we feel all we had is their estimate and that we have to have some credibility. I think our view is that there are some things that might be done that could actually shorten some of the timeframes. But we don't know what the issues are that were driving the delays. And so, that's one of the things that we need to spend some time on. And so, I'd love to give you comfort, but until we get through some of those discussions with the contractor, I don't think it's a thing that I should be doing. I think we need to go through those discussions, have those discussions, understand the delay, look at the mitigation plans to the extent possible to try to reduce delays, and then come up with what we really all feel is the correct information. And we did not want to not tell you about this, because we got this notification. We all know it also puts us in a difficult position because we feel that we can work some of this, but we haven't had the time to do that yet. And we will, and by the time we talk to you again, we will have that information. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I don't know, Oct\u00e1vio, do you want to add anything to that? Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp : No. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Okay. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And just one other clarification on Cameron is the \u2013 are weather conditions and flooding and things like that something that would be kind of like a force majeure on a timing or no? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Not just weather conditions, no. There are certain provisions of the contract that are very well-defined as what constitutes the force majeure. And just having rain and bad weather would not be a force majeure. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Switching gears just to detail clarifications. The $34 million of stock-based comp change, is that pre-tax or after-tax? And would you still be in your range for this year if that did not happen? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Let's have Trevor talk about it. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yeah, Steve, this is Trevor. That's a tax item, so it's really an after-tax adjustment. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then would you still be in your range this year if that had not happened? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yes. Yes, we would. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just on the PEMEX currency volatility, should we assume that it's still kind of goes the same way as in the past, i.e., if the peso weakens, it tends to be a benefit; and if the peso strengthens, it tends to be a hurt, or is that also unpredictable? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Steve, this is Joe. Yeah. I would say generally that is correct. Because it measures deferred taxes and monetary assets and liabilities, it could swing around if we had cash positions or debt positions and the deferred taxes, of course, over time will move. So, I think, directionally, you have it right, it should be in the same direction. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yes. Operator : We will go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Couple of questions. First of all, your thoughts on U.S. renewable opportunities for Sempra. Just curious in terms of whether you still see significant opportunities at all or none for either contracted wind or contracted solar growth for U.S. Gas & Power? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : We see some great opportunities for growth in renewables. And we're working on several projects where we've secured kind of the rights and the contracts and that are in early stages of development. We have the ability to expand the Mesquite side. We have the ability to expand the Broken Bow Wind side. And so, we think that with all of the RPS standards that are coming across the country that there are some good growth opportunities for renewables. I will say that the returns on renewables have gone down over time. And so, what we look at is, we really have good projects that have decent returns on them, because otherwise we can invest our capital. And so, we always look at the allocation of our capital to the projects to give us the highest returns. And since we're not \u2013 renewable is just one of the things we do. We're not going to just go after building megawatts. We're going to go after building megawatts that give us good return on our capital. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Debbie. One other question back to the U.S. utilities and sorry if I'm staying a little U.S. centric here. What's not in the CapEx guidance that you laid out at the Analyst Day this summer, but that could provide upside to U.S. utility rate base growth? I'm thinking things like Otay Mesa, which I don't think was in that guidance. But what else is kind of in there that when I think about the next three years to five years could lead to higher rate base than what you laid out in July? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, you actually named one. So, let me turn it to Jeff, and he can talk about SDG&E, and then Dennis can talk about SoCalGas, because there are a number of things that we're working on right now including the potential of a DC transmission line. So, Jeff? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Michael. We laid out at our Analyst Conference some of these green box items, which were not in the plan that could provide some additional upside. Now, just to give you a brief update, I mean one of the things I think we've done relatively successful is you've got to be able to manage both your GRC capital and the capital for projects which are proved outside the GRC. So, just recently, we've had, just to be sure, we've had $1 billion of incremental projects approved, that's not incremental to the plan, but that's outside the GRC. That's the Cleveland National Forest Project, Sycamore-PQ as well as the batteries which were discussed earlier on the call. So, we're making great progress there for our 2016, 2017 and 2018 capital plan, it was roughly $3.5 billion, $3.25 billion of that has already been approved and it's going forward. So, that really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the certainty of our future capital plan. In terms of things which are not in the plan, Debbie touched on the DC line, this is the Southwest Power link which originates in Arizona. We think there's an opportunity as we think about providing more reliability particularly into the LA Basin of giving access to more renewables and more power from that Palo Verde, generating center in Arizona back into California, that's one project of about $1 billion. Secondly, we think there's an increased opportunity for batteries. At San Diego Gas & Electric by the end of Q1, we will have just over 50 megawatts of utility-owned batteries. And we think there's an incremental 200 megawatt opportunity. That's really associated with this new bill which was passed this year, which is AB 2868, which called for 500 megawatts of new batteries to be installed, split one-third between the three industrial and utilities. Otay Mesa you referenced, which is a 600 megawatt combined cycle plant in the heart of our load center, that is subject to a put-call arrangement with Calpine. And as you may recall, I think correctly from our last Analyst Conference that was not included in our five-year plan. And then the last thing I'd mention is electric vehicles. I mean, with the passage of SB 32, we're now required to drive our greenhouse gas emissions footprint in California 40% below 1990 over the next 14 years, and almost 50% of that has to come from the transportation sector. In fact, that's close to 53% or 54% in our service territories. So, big picture on this greenhouse gas issue, Michael, is you've only got about 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions coming from electric generation that sits inside the State of California. Maybe another 8% to 10% outside the state. There's no question, if the state is serious about meeting its goals, we have to have a revolution around the transportation sector. And I think almost in every scenario, the California utilities will play big in that space. Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy : Hey, Michael, this is Dennis Arriola. Let me just touch on three things real quick. One is, we expect that going forward, there's going to be new national or state rules or regulations on storage. And I think that that's an opportunity as we continue to enhance the overall infrastructure and the safety of all of our facilities. That's number one. The second, and we've touched on this a little bit but we're seeing more momentum here in the state, is focusing on using natural gas for heavy duty transportation, so the fueling infrastructure around that. And then thirdly, focusing on the gathering and cleaning of renewable natural gas from landfills and dairies and things. So, we're not going to give out dollar amounts for those yet, but I think those are three areas that we definitely see opportunity and upside for our gas companies here in California. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Mark, congrats, and look forward to seeing you out fly fishing at some point. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Michael. Operator : And we will go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just want to follow-up on the LNG just a little bit more. The joint venture contractors, can you just review the credit support and what you have with respect to their ability to \u2013 just their financial wherewithal to, their guarantees and what have you for the project? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. I'm going to have \u2013 I can give a high level, but I'm going to have Joe or Mark address more details. We do have performance assurances with CB&I and Chiyoda; they have a joint and several guarantee from each of the parties and a letter of credit as a backstop. So, we have that. And I don't know if you guys want to add anything more to that. Okay. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : We have \u2013 there's very strong credit support. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. I just wanted to review that. And then the \u2013 I mean, is it unusual for them to sort of call up and say, we've got a problem, but not tell you what the cause of the problem is? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : What they have to do is they have to lay out the detailed schedule of everything that they expect to happen like with the construction and the new detailed schedule. And we just go that, I think it was Friday of last week. And so, that's how they begin the discussion on this is that they lay out a new detailed schedule, and then the discussion comes around that new detailed schedule. So, as I said, we just got that Friday, I think it was of last week. And then, that will begin the discussions. So, I mean, that's kind of the process. They are the ones responsible for giving official notification. And that was the process that they followed. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, the Train 4, the partner who dropped out, can you tell us a little bit more about which partner that is and why they dropped out? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No. But... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : ...I can just tell you why they've indicated that they don't want to do it. It's a company that's changed their strategy, and is really focused on some downstream more now and more clean green energy. And so, they are looking not to invest major portions of their capital in LNG, and that's what they indicated to us. It was a strategy change. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, the accounting change, the $34 million stock compensation, what triggered that? What was the reason why that happened? And is there any impact past this year for 2017 or beyond? Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yeah. This is Trevor. That was as a result of an accounting standard update which was 2016-09 that we implemented and we early adopted this year. So, historically, what you've done is you've taken that tax benefit and it's gone straight to APIC or accumulated \u2013 or paid-in capital. Now, it's trying to simplify the accounting associated with that, and so you take that tax benefit and you push it through the P&L. So going forward, we'll treat it the same way. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Meaning going forward, will \u2013 I'm sorry to be slow, but what that does mean in terms of... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. There'll be earnings going forward... Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yes. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : ...of similar amount. It won't always be the same, because it will depend on what restricted stock and other stock is vesting. Many other utilities have also adopted it this year. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So, that should be good for earnings going forward. Am I right? Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : That's right. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then maybe in a similar amount. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, assuming \u2013 it could go... Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yeah, it can go either way. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I don't want to give an \u2013 yeah, inference that you can add $34 million a year. That's not the way it works. So, why don't you discuss how it works. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yeah. The way it works is \u2013 when the original grant is issued, that stock-based compensation is an expense. And you take that tax benefit. If it vests at a higher amount and the stock price increases, then there's more of a tax deduction in those future years. And so, historically, the stock price has been rising. And the grants have been vesting at the multiplier, meaning that there is a higher tax benefit in future years. That tax benefit has historically gone through adjusted trading (55:20) capital. And now, the accounting standard says, put it through the P&L. So, going forward, we anticipate, assuming that the stock price continues to rise, and that the multiplier effect is in place, like it has been in the past years, we would get a similar type benefit. If it doesn't, if the stock price were to go down and it still vests, it could actually have a decrement to earnings in the future, but that's just how it can go both ways. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : What if there was no change in the stock price? Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Then there would be \u2013 then you would not have that tax benefit when those stocks vest because you take that tax benefit when you issue the grant over those periods. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks so much for the clarification. And congratulations to Mark. Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Hi. Good morning still. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : On the letter of credit that you mentioned, how large is the letter of credit? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : You're talking about the Cameron letter of credit? Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : That's correct. How big is it? Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : I don't know offhand. I don't remember offhand. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. We'll have to get back to you. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I don't remember offhand. We'll get it to you. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Is it hundreds of millions or $100 million or... Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : No, no. We'll get back to you. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : We'll get the information. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : I don't want to give you a bad number. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : We'll get the information. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : That's fine. And what triggers it? Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : It would be a default. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Non-performance. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Non-performance, yeah. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : It's non-performance. Okay. And then, are there any, like, surety insurers like surety bonds or anything like that or nothing like that? Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : No. No. This is \u2013 keep in mind this is a very, very large project. There's really not that much bonding capacity in the market. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : And one very large credit-worthy counterparties on the other side and a big joint venture. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Well, yeah. And keep in mind the \u2013 you're talking just about the contractor here. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Yeah. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : These are very large credit-worthy companies, and so it would be unusual to have that kind of a bonding capacity and a project that size. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I want to stress, as I said, that between CB&I and Chiyoda is a joint and several guarantee. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Right. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : So, they basically assume each other's responsibility, so... Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : And I don't \u2013 but I also think too there's no indication that they're not performing. But they have an obligation under the contract to tell us if they think there's going to be a delay. They've notified us of that, and we'll work through it to see if we can mitigate it. But they're not saying that they can't finish the job. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : And I know that you haven't spoken to them, but it's just based on your comments, it seems that the delay seems to be around the flooding, right, and all the rain that you had down there, is that correct? Is that kind of your plan? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : All we can say on that is that what they think, didn't give us any official notification and the information that they sent to us. So, when we listen to their earnings call, on the earnings call, they said that there was rain at the site and the site of their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge that caused some flooding, and that they expected some delays in construction. That's what they said on their call. You can listen to their call and get the precise language. I'm just kind of reiterating what they've said. But we don't have any official notification. And we will be meeting with them soon. It's something where all the partners have to sit down with them together. So, it's not something that you can do instantly because this is a joint venture. And so, it will be our self and our three partners sitting down with CB&I and Chiyoda. And I think it's scheduled within the next week or two for that meeting to occur. To really go through, as I said, they give us this massive package that has a detailed schedule that they produced on the construction. And someone asked me, what gives you some assurances, well, part of the whole effort is to go through that detailed schedule that they gave us and to ensure that everything has been given consideration. And that's the process they need to go through. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Okay. The last question I have and I apologize if I'm not as familiar. I'm very familiar with CB&I. But Chiyoda, how are they \u2013 I guess what they're a separate company unrelated to CB&I or they're a subsidiary that does this type of work with them or what's the relationship? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : It is a huge multinational company that's not at all private CB&I other than through this joint venture. It's a Japanese-owned construction company. I don't know what their market cap is or but it's, yeah. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : I get it. Yeah. I'm not that smart. Okay. Thank you very much. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Okay. Thanks again for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in the next few weeks. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team and have a really nice day. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you, everyone, for your participation.",

Mihalik - Sempra Energy Analysts : Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Operator : Please standby, we're about to begin. Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Welcome to Sempra Energy's fourth quarter 2016 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website. With me in San Diego are Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Group President Utilities; Joe Householder, Group President of Infrastructure; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 28, 2017, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Rick. On today's call, I will discuss several topics. Our 2016 achievements and update on the key items our management team is focused on in 2017 and our 2017 earnings guidance and dividend. This morning we reported full-year 2016 earnings of $5.46 per share or $5.05 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2016 adjusted earnings include a net $0.11 per share benefit related to several additional items. The adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation and a change in our planned repatriation, both partially offset by a revaluation of deferred income taxes related to Peruvian tax reform and the impairment of the north south pipeline. This net benefit largely offset the loss of earnings resulting from the sale of our interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. In 2016, we delivered on our financial targets and positioned ourselves for future success by resolving some key issues that I will discuss in a few minutes. We are pleased to announce we are raising our 2017 earnings guidance to a range of $4.85 to $5.25 per share, up from our previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 per share. Jeff will review the key drivers of our increased guidance. At Sempra, we have a long-standing commitment of growing our dividend. Consistent with this, our board approved a 9% increase in the 2017 dividend to $3.29 per share last week. As you'll recall, we're targeting 8% to 9% annual dividend increases over the next several years. The strength of our projected future cash flow gives us confidence we can grow our dividend at a higher rate than our utility peers. It also reinforces our commitment to maximizing total shareholder value through a combination of dividend and earnings growth. The next few slides will highlight our key areas of focus in 2017, beginning with our California utilities on slide 5. Earlier this month, we reached an important proposed agreement on the cost of capital extension. The agreement sets SDG&E's and SoCalGas' authorized return on equity to 10.2% and 10.05%, respectively through 2019. In 2018, we will true-up long-term debt costs to actual debt costs at both are our California utilities. The debt true-up impacts earnings at the utilities by about $36 million per year, which we had already assumed in our financial plans. This proposed agreement is an important step in gaining greater certainty to our planned utility earnings. Since we had already forecasted a debt true-up in 2018, the settlement has no material impact to the assumptions discussed at last year's Analyst Conference regarding utility capital structure and returns. CPUC approval is required, which is expected in the first half this year. Moving to Aliso Canyon, SoCalGas has resolved a number of key issues, we sealed the leak over a year ago. The Department of Public Health conducted indoor and outdoor testing, which facilitated residents returning to their homes last summer. We've entered into two settlement agreements with governmental agencies, including the recent settlement with South Coast AQMD and at the facility we've strengthened the infrastructure and filed for approval to begin injections. Our focus going forward is to resolve the remaining issues as expeditiously and safely as possible, including resuming injections at (5:57), continuing to collect insurance proceeds and resolving remaining legal claims. Turning to SONGS, the final decision in the arbitration hearing against MHI is expected in the near future. The existing SONGS settlement agreement calls for an even split of their war between ratepayers and shareholders after reimbursement of attorney's fees. As a reminder, at the end of last year, the CPUC directed the parties to revisit the 2014 SONGS settlement agreement. By April 28, all parties must come to an agreement, or the CPUC will begin further proceedings. Two all-party meetings have been held. We maintain that the existing settlement agreement is consistent with regulatory precedent and takes into consideration the best interests of the parties. Please turn to slide 6 for an update on Cameron. I want to assure you that completing Cameron JV Trains 1-3 and putting them into service is a top priority for Sempra and the other owners. The JV continues to monitor the construction activities as well as the quality of the work and provides weekly progress reports to Sempra and other owners. Since the owners received the updated working schedule in early November, executive management from Cameron JV has had multiple meetings with Cameron's contractor to discuss and review the schedule and path forward. Sempra management has also had discussions with the contractors. Cameron JV continues to engage additional independent resources to provide further insight into the construction process and progress. And the contractor has implemented a number of additional measures, which we think are important. The measures include improvement of drainage at the site to help mitigate effects of adverse weather conditions and re-sequencing the work to minimize risk and improve efficiency among other things. Cameron's contractor believes the current schedule is achievable and calls for in-service timeframes of mid-2018 for Train 1, end of 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. When we provide our 2018 earnings projections at the Analyst Conference, our results will reflect these estimated dates. It is important to note that Cameron JV's exposure is safeguarded in two important ways. First, the lump sum turnkey contract is generally designed to transfer certain cost overrun and schedule risk to Cameron's contractor. Second, Cameron JV's tariff adjustment mechanism is designed to materially preserve its IRR in connection with cost overruns and schedule changes. Sempra's focus continues to be delivering the overall long-term value of our interest in the Cameron JV to our shareholders, while reducing risk. Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address the current political and business environment. I will take a minute to address potential policy implications to Mexico and later Jeff will discuss potential tax reform. The current administration is focused on addressing the U.S. trade imbalance. The value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico in 2016 was more than twice the value of U.S. energy imports from Mexico, improving the U.S. trade imbalance. IEnova's business supports this by helping build the backbone of Mexico's energy infrastructure. We continue to see great growth potential in Mexico and will highlight some of the opportunities we see at the upcoming Analyst Conference. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff for his first earnings call as CFO. Please turn to slide 7. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. I have the good fortune of starting my new role on a positive note. We've updated our plan and are increasing our 2017 EPS guidance range. Our new 2017 guidance is $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Our new range is up from the previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20, provided at last year's Analyst Conference. Next, I'll briefly discuss the key drivers of our updated guidance. First, both SDG&E and IEnova had strong performance in 2016, and we expect the improved performance to continue. Given the strong international growth opportunities, we're no longer planning to repatriate cash from current earnings from Mexico or Peru. Our plan is to indefinitely reinvest the cash locally in capital projects. Compared to previous guidance, our tax expense is lower because of this change. These benefits were partially offset by higher insurance costs at SDG&E and SoCalGas, that are not fully offset by cost savings included in our prior plan. Let's turn to slide 8 to discuss our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $379 million or $1.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $383 million or $1.52 per share. Full-year 2016 earnings were $1.370 billion or $5.46 per share. This compares favorably to 2015 earnings of $1.349 billion or $5.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2016 earnings were $5.05 per share. This year you'll also see the organizational changes we announced last fall. Our operations are now combined into two groups, Sempra Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the appendix. Next I'll go through a comparison of 2016 to 2015. This slide highlights our recent results and that they were impacted by several items. Debbie addressed the first five items earlier in her remarks. Please note that the change in our planned repatriation resulted in a reversal in 2016 of a $20 million tax charge taken in 2015. The other main drivers of the year-over-year comparison are as follows; $9 million of net higher earnings at the California utilities, offset by $14 million lower favorable impact from the resolution of prior year's taxes at parent and $25 million lower favorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects at Sempra Mexico and the South American utilities. Next, let's please turn to slide 10. I'd like to end with a discussion on tax reform. There are a few proposals being circulated and we've evaluated several scenarios. At a high-level, we believe that most likely outcomes would not materially impact our projected earnings. At our California utilities, which represent almost 80% of our 2016 adjusted earnings, we don't expect any significant impact. It's important to remember there's been a history of flow-through treatment for major tax reform dating back to 1986 and we expect any differences to be recorded in the memo account established by our final 2016 GRC. Under that decision, you will recall, we're required to track the impacts of tax changes with amounts reviewed in the next rate case. There are also opportunities to offset any potential reduced rate base from 100% expensing with additional capital spending. When you consider the potential impact to our EPS five years from now, we expect there's a potential range of a negative 5% to 6% to a positive 5% to 6%. The low end assumes 20% corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital, immediate non-deductibility of interest, and a potential to use some foreign cash to reduce U.S. debt. In contrast, the high-end scenario has the same assumptions except Cameron qualifies for the border tax exemption and the non-deductibility of interest is confined to new debt only. We've also looked at additional scenarios, which we believe are more likely and involve some form of mitigation resulting in a range of negative 1% to 3%. To be clear, we found this to be the most likely outcome. It's uncertain if there'll be any material change to our current tax laws, but if they are the impacts to our earnings profile to be materially different than what is shown here. In the interim, we'll be working with key trade associations and independently to ensure that the unique aspects of our industry and our company are fully understood and fairly represented. Next, please turn to slide 11 for a few closing remarks from Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Jeff. In summary, we were able to meet our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance, while positioning ourselves for long-term success. We executed our operational plan and continue to resolve key challenges, including finalizing the GRC at our California utilities and most recently reaching a proposed settlement on the cost of capital extension, closing the PEMEX JV acquisition, winning the marine pipeline bid jointly with TransCanada and executing the successful IEnova equity follow-on offerings in Mexico. Selling REX and our Southeast utilities to more closely align our assets with our long-term growth strategy and making significant progress related to Aliso Canyon. These are just some of the accomplishments that have established our foundation for future success and give us confidence in our 2017 dividend growth and earnings guidance discussed today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Conference here in San Diego on April 4 and April 5 and talking more then about our future. Finally, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Mark Snell for his extraordinary contributions to the success of Sempra. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the last 15 years, and we wish him well as he moves into the next chapter of his life. With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you have. Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I just wanted to be \u2013 a couple of questions. First is, I just wanted to make sure it's clear that you're going to assume Train 1 mid-2018, Train 2 end of 2018, Train 3 in mid-2019, when you give us the guidance in April, but you have not formally agreed to a change in the contract in terms of the delivery dates, is that right? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Let me hit the high level and then I'll have Joe talk a little bit about where we are on that. As we look at the schedule on the trains, the schedule that you laid out is the schedule that has been confirmed by the contractors, the schedule that they believe that they can deliver the trains on. And we've been doing a lot of due diligence work both with the Cameron JV and then some follow-up meetings that the Sempra team has had with the contractor. And so, when we give our guidance \u2013 assuming nothing changes between now and the time we give our future guidance, we will be using that estimate that the contractor has affirmed to us as their current estimate. In terms of contractually, we're still working through all of those issues, but we've basically been using that as the schedule for the trains. Joe, do you want to add? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Greg. The concise answer to your question is no, we did not change the contract, but the contractor still has earlier dates in it. This is their working schedule that they're working with and the one they think is achievable. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So that's important for our understanding of the safeguards, right, that you're not giving \u2013 you're conceding that they won't owe you liquidated damages if they're late? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : We have not \u2013 that's correct, we've not. And as you might remember, our IRR pretty much stays intact, whether there is a change in cost or a change in schedule. The most important thing is our earnings are protected it's just a question really of what happens to the tariff with respect to the issue that (19:24). Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. And then Jeff I had a question for you, you commented on a decision to not undertake tax repatriation from South America, because of the better growth prospects there. So not to jump the gun on the Analyst Day presentation, but is it safe to assume that we're going to see higher regulated capital expenditures in Chile and the Peru versus the prior plan as a result of that reassessment? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Greg, thanks a lot for your question. I mean I think one of the things I would say in response is we had our largest ever capital campaign last year of $5.3 billion, that was driven largely by our California utilities with $2.7 billion. But we are seeing a lot more deal flow outside of our regulated utilities, a lot of that showed up last year in Mexico. I think from a repatriation standpoint, we're really looking at whether we can put those earnings to work in a more efficient way there locally. And that currently is our assumption going into our planning period. So this is something we probably as you indicated, we'll give you a lot more visibility on in April. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay, great. And then can I ask you know I know \u2013 this is last question for me, the list of changes on page 9 from 2015 to 2016. As I think about what the old guidance was and how you did significantly better than old guidance on what you delivered in 2016, thank you for that. So what were the key changes that happened as you sort of got into the fourth quarter that moved you from the middle of the old guidance range to where you actually delivered? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I think... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I would assume, they were some of the tax changes in the repatriation and some of the order tax things. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes, so I mean those were the major things that occurred, there were, we tried to delineate pretty much everything that was happening for the quarter and for the year. So you could get a good picture of it. And I think that the major issues were some of the tax things and then there was a change in the accounting methodology for stock-based compensation and that also had an effect for last year's results. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. One other clarification on Cameron, when you last talked about this, the contractors never had told you why there was a delay. So, have they clarified to you why the delay in the schedule? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. I mean, what they've claimed is that much of the delay was due to weather conditions and as we've all known that there has been a lot of rain that's occurred. What I'd like to do though, was \u2013 Joe actually met with the principals of the CB&I yesterday with the lead director on our board for our \u2013 actually the chair of our LNG construction committee, and he is the prior CEO of Fluor. And so they both went and met with the principals of CB&I yesterday, and I thought \u2013 I think it might be helpful to add a little bit more color on what came from that meeting. Joe? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. These are complex projects. There's thousands \u2013 there's over 20,000 line items of things that they're working on. So there's lots of things that go on in the project. Certainly weather is a factor among other things. One of the things that we spoke about yesterday when we talked about their confidence in meeting the working schedule is, they're making sure that logistically they're doing things in the best way possible. So, for example, they were talking about how they're going to move pieces of equipment directly to locations, reducing the use of cranes. There's so many different things, it's hard to characterize and pin anything on one particular item, because there are so many. But we had a good meeting with them yesterday and spoke about a number of issues. Again, remember that the Cameron joint venture is, the one in-charge of the contract with them and working with them on a daily basis and our director and I were there to basically do due diligence for Sempra to understand where they were and their confidence level in moving along and keeping to the working schedule and keeping that on track. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Want to \u2013 maybe just a little bit of a logistical question for the Analyst Day. Is your intention to still do the same kind of year-ahead outlook and then five-year outlook, as you've always done? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Our intention is to give the 2018 numbers and then to give a growth rate through 2021, consistent with... Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : ...ahead of our past practice. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And just at a high level and again I'm not sure this is fully possible right now, but just you mentioned like the repatriation changes, you have the updated schedule for Cameron, but is there any kind of things that we should just be kind of noting that have changed a lot versus the long-term outlook given then? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I think those are the things you named are the most significant things and we'll give you the details of that when we get to the Analyst Conference with laying out our 2018 numbers and then what has changed from when we last forecast 2018, which was several years ago. So, one thing as an example when we last forecast 2018, we still were forecasting REX in it. So, I mean I think most of those things you know about and I don't think that there is anything that I'm aware of that you probably don't already know about, but how it all comes together we'll share with you when we get to the Analyst Meeting. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. And I guess last question just on Mexico, you talked very briefly on it, but just maybe a little bit more color on how you're looking at the kind of political economic implications of the new administration and the like, and just maybe a little more color on, is it impacting future bids or kind of strategy around IEnova. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No. We really haven't seen anything impacting our business in Mexico. We see amazing growth opportunities in Mexico, and what we see there happening is that the markets that are opening are creating additional opportunities for us. We see some electric transmission bids coming, renewables is a big focus, they've set a renewable portfolio standard. Those bids we see going forward and then we're really interested in some opportunities we see with liquids pipelines and receiving terminals. And so, we see that business continuing to move forward and in discussions that we've had with the officials in Mexico and then with some of the administration that this \u2013 when we look at energy imports, exports, the U.S. export is twice as much in the energy space to Mexico as we receive from Mexico. So it really meets what the focus is, is to correct any trade imbalances. And so we see that opportunity for us to continue to grow in the energy space in Mexico remaining under the administration. And so going forward, we'd be talking about a lot of opportunities that Carlos and his team have on the drawing board right now, when we get to our Analyst Meeting, and are very excited about it. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Hi. One housekeeping question and then one maybe more structural question. On the housekeeping side, can you just talk about the impact of bonus depreciation over the next couple of years, and also your position under current tax law in terms of cash tax payments levels over the next couple of years? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I'm going to have Jeff and Trevor talk about that. As Jeff mentioned, when we looked at the provisions of tax reform going forward and the impact of bonus depreciation beyond the time that we had envisioned in our plan, because when we gave you our plans, we always looked at the bonus depreciation effect in the plans as far as that had been continued. Now if that continues beyond the timeframe, Jeff indicated to you that we thought it would be \u2013 it's about a 10% more capital or about a $100 million of each utility that would need to be spent to offset that, and we feel that that is very achievable with the kinds of long-term projects that we have like PSEP underway. So, but I'll have Jeff specifically talk on the cash tax impact. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Michael. I will just start by saying that when you get back to what the policymakers' priorities are in California, you think about safety and reliability and grid modernization. I mean, these are kind of ride in the wheelhouse. So we think it is important to our customers. So, if you go back to the original conversation on bonus depreciation several years ago, I think what you've really seen is the company is spending more capital to meet the policymakers' requirements, and no real change in terms of the impact to our rate base. And I think to Debbie's point, the bonus depreciation rules, which are in place today, were really reflected in the guidance we laid out last summer. And then on a going-forward basis, if you did move under tax reform to a 100% expensing, I think what we've laid out is, to Debbie's point again, it would require us about another $100 million of incremental capital at each of our utility to not have any erosion to our rate base. So, I think one of the things that we're kind of embolden by as we spend about \u2013 invest about $2.7 billion in 2016, which is one of our highest shares ever in terms of capital deployment at SoCalGas and SDG&E, we have lots of opportunity going forward. So I think there is a fair amount of enthusiasm of getting to the Analyst Day and kind of laying out that larger capital plan. And then with respect to cash taxes, currently, we had an effective tax rate last year of 21%, we think that probably goes up slightly going into 2017, but currently, we are not in a cash taxpaying situation. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yes, we're not in a cash taxpaying situation throughout the period of the plan that we will be presenting. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then, Debbie, thinking a little more structural, you made the organizational shift kind of creating a Utilities Group and an Infrastructure Group. Are you rethinking the broader structure, meaning are you and the board rethinking the broader structure of Sempra at all about what pieces fit well together and have natural synergies with each other across the multiple different businesses and multiple different geographies you serve, and whether there is a greater opportunity to create value, if maybe some of the pieces aren't part of the same corporate puzzles? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I mean, Michael, we always look at that, and that we always assess the structure of our company, we look at the assets that we have and which assets we want to keep and which we want to dispose of. I mean I think you've seen us do that clearly. We \u2013 in the last year we sold REX and we sold the Mobile Gas and Willmut Gas. And so, we always look at those things, and there is nothing in the near-term offing for that, but as those businesses continue to grow; we've tried to preserve optionality. I mean that was one reason we did the IPO in Mexico, we have an ownership in Peru that is outside of our ownership and we tried to structure these things in a way that will give us flexibility. The businesses no longer fit together in a portfolio that we would have the option of changing the way the businesses are structured, but there is nothing that we have \u2013 you should not read this as a sign that anything is planned now. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Debbie. Much appreciated. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So, on Cameron, in terms of \u2013 I mean if I heard your comments, you sound like you guys were a little bit more oriented maybe towards reducing risks, and I didn't hear as much about expansion or potential expansion, is there been a change or are there any thoughts that, just basically how you guys always have thought about it or is there any sort of reassessment or any change in how you look at the risk or opportunity at Cameron? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : When we \u2013 what Joe was going through is, when we structured Cameron, we were very clear on the risk that Sempra was willing to keep and the risk that we wanted to lay off to other parties. And for Trains 1 through 3, it was very clear to us that we did not want to take the construction risk associated with either pricing or timing of construction, because we were not doing the construction and we were not \u2013 you have a joint venture overseeing the construction, it wasn't Sempra alone overseeing the construction. So, we fashioned this in a way that we protected our shareholder interest and keeping the economics of the project solid, regardless of what happened with the timing or the cost of construction. We laid those risks off intentionally. That's not to say that we're not looking at expansion and when we did that contract, we also looked at the expandability of the facility and we had terms in the agreement that went through, how we would expand to a 5-train facility. We've commented before that one of our partners has not been willing to provide the equity for the expansion and that we are working to resolve those issues with that partner, so that we can expand to a Train 4, that we've had meetings with that partner and the principals of that partner and are in discussions with them to see, if we can reach a resolution on that. And then, once we get that resolved, we are very interested in continuing forward with Cameron Train 4, because we think it's going to be one of the lowest cost options in the marketplace and it's a really good option. And so, nothing has changed in that, but as we told you before, we've got to resolve this partner issue in order for us to move forward with expansion and we're diligently working on that now. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. And then, I apologize for being \u2013 if I missed this. But the border tax adjustment, it just isn't intuitive to me why that would apply, what is it that \u2013 how does that work I guess, why would... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes, I'm going to have \u2013 go ahead with your question. I am sorry. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I'm just wondering, I guess, just simply, why would it apply to Cameron in the first place, I guess? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Okay. I'm going to have Jeff go through that for Cameron and as we indicated, we think it's not a highly likely scenario, but there are, depending on how this is drafted in terms of the final tax provisions, and we all know that's a moving target now, so that there are some ways where it could apply and be a benefit. Jeff? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Good afternoon, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : I think just as you think about it, under a border adjustment, the taxes will apply to where the goods are consumed rather than produced. And the thing that hits us most directly as you recall, we have two facilities that actually we import power in the United States from. The first one is our Mexicali Power Plant referred to as TdM, that one is held for sale, so we expect that will resolve itself by middle of the summer. And then secondly, IEnova has the ESJ wind farm that dispatches into the California grid. We've done some assessment around that and the applicable taxes, if border adjustment did go forward and we think that's a non-material issue to our company. But what's a little bit interesting is, if you think about the Cameron facility, it's probably unlikely, Paul, that it would apply to us, but there have been scenarios in different bad countries, where the export exemption has applied upstream. So think about that as a towing facility, no different than a power plant, right? Our customers bring gas to the facility and they are ultimately the ultimate exporter from the facility, it's just something we want to track closely, because if you did see a decline in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, if the border adjustment did apply, it would be reducing the tax on Cameron an incremental 20% to 0%. So again, to Debbie's point, it's probably speculative at this point. It will really depend on how the legislation is written, but it's something that we'll be actively following. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. And then I guess the sundry item on the balance sheet went up about $100 million I think from Q3 to Q4. Was there any earnings impact associated with that? Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Paul, it's Trevor. No, there is no earnings impact with that. Primarily what the increase there is it's the greenhouse gas allowances and then also the assets associated with the pension benefit. So, those are really the drivers on the increase, but no P&L impacts on those items. We used to combine the Rabbi Trust in there and then that, any movement in the Rabbi Trust would have a small P&L impact, but there we've broken it out a couple lines above. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Thanks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Paul. Operator : And we'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Good afternoon. Faisel from Citi. Have you guys looked at this sort of the smaller scale LNG or modular scale LNG sort of concept that we've seen both Cheniere talk about and this new start-up, Tellurian, talk about, have you guys looked at that as sort of a competing technology to the expansions at Cameron? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : We have looked at that technology. We specifically looked at it for ECA and whether or not something like that would be better than trying to convert the facility at Costa Azul. Joe, do you want to comment on that? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Faisel, as Debbie said, we continue to look at many of these things, we look at a lot of projects. We're very mostly focused on the three projects, the Cameron expansion, the Port Arthur and ECA facility and building the larger scale trains, we think those will have the best economics and in terms of getting to the large scale customers. I think a lot of these smaller scale wins work well in the emerging markets things and some of the other ones, but that's not where our current focus is. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. Because some of these facilities are modular design, but they're still large facilities like 50 million ton, 20 million ton facilities, but I guess with what these new companies are advertising or our technologies are advertising is that they can get the cost structure sort of down below a certain number to make them competitive, so it sounds like you guys have looked at this technology and it's not necessary \u2013 you don't think it's cost competitive with the bigger scale trains. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. And what I would say is that we've looked at this several times and that it depends on the market that you want to serve, and when we looked at it, as we were looking at potentially serving the Hawaiian market out of Costa Azul and something like that for a smaller market may make sense. I mean most of what we're looking at is the focus on the lowest cost for the volume of the facility and we don't see that technology as being the best technology when you have the kind of facilities that we have, that have great shipping up lanes and docking potential and all of that. If you had to serve islands in the Caribbean or Hawaii, it's by application and by the market you are going after and that we tend to go after the larger markets with long-term contracts and that's kind of our business plan. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : These might eventually turnout okay, but when you are dealing with the big utilities, you're looking for something that has sustained reliability over long periods of time and they want to make sure that when they sign up for something that you are going to be able to deliver operating results over long periods of time. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Understood. Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yes. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the conference back to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, thanks for joining us this morning. We really appreciated the questions and we hope to see all of you at our Analyst Conference on April 4 and April 5 in San Diego. And if you have any follow-up questions our IR team will be available to respond to them later today. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.",

Householder - Sempra Energy Analysts : Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's first quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and CEO; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 9, 2017, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks for joining us this morning. And I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, and not whoever that other company was that that operator put on. Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the webcast for our analyst conference a few weeks ago. I appreciate the useful feedback we received. For those of you who were unable to attend, you can find all of the conference materials on our website. I'd like to start off by reiterating Sempra's long-term value drivers. First, we expect to grow our EPS 10% to 11% from 2017 through 2021 by successfully executing on project already under contract, and our Infrastructure businesses and our expected utility performance. Second, we plan to grow our dividend from 2017 by 8% to 9% annually, then reassess that for additional increases after Cameron's three trains come online. And third, our increased cash flow should provide $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in additional debt capacity in 2021. This offers us the flexibility to further enhance long-term shareholder value. And four, we expect to capture opportunities over the next five years to add to or extend our earnings growth. Before I turn it over to Jeff, please turn to slide five. One of the ways we measure our success is delivering on our EPS guidance. Jeff will review a few of our recent operational successes and our first quarter results, which keep us on track to meet our 2017 earnings guidance of $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Jeff? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks a lot, Debbie. First, regarding the cost of capital, we remain constructive on the settlement and believe it's in the best interest of all parties. We continue to expect that the settlement or something in a substantially similar form will be approved. Second, we're focused on executing the capital plan that we laid out at our conference by advancing major projects, in particular Cameron's Trains 1 through 3 in the marine pipeline. We've also made near-term progress on several other projects. At SDG&E, we signed five new contracts for battery storage facilities totaling 83.5 megawatt, 70 megawatt of which will be directly owned by SDG&E. SDG&E also placed one of the largest lithium-ion battery systems in the world into service in the first quarter. Many of you had the opportunity to visit SDG&E during the conference to hear about this and how it supports California's electrification efforts, as well as furthering the state's policy goal by reducing carbon emission. IEnova expects to complete three natural gas pipelines by the end of the second quarter. This also represents a combined investment of close to $900 million. Each project you recall is backed by 25-year U.S. dollar denominated contract with CFE. Third, we're also looking at new investment opportunities. Let me list a few examples. IEnova recently agreed to construct a solar facility with a 20-year PPA for 110 megawatts with an industrial steel company. This is the first bilateral agreement in Mexico under the new market for renewables where the off-taker is a private company. We anticipate there'll more opportunities like this. The Pima Solar facility is expected to cost roughly $115 million and be operational by the end of 2018. This project is also a great example of how we at Sempra leverage our experience across different growth platforms. The success we've demonstrated in the U.S. renewable business allows us to compete more effectively for projects just like this in Mexico. We also made CPUC filings for additional projects representing the potential for almost $500 million of new capital. To be clear, these projects were not included in the capital plan we outlined at the analyst conference. These projects include an expansion of SoCalGas' Master Meter program for Mobile Home Parks and SDG&E's proposal to replace its Customer Information System. Now, please turn to the next slide. Our first quarter financial results was the strongest first quarter performance Sempra has experienced since it was formed. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. This compares favorably to first quarter 2016 earnings of $353 million or $1.40 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $438 million or $1.74 per share. Again, this compares to first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $404 million or $1.60 per share. You'll also recall that we adopted the new accounting standard on stock-based compensation in the third quarter of last year. This was applied retroactively to the first quarter of 2016, and accordingly increased earnings by $34 million in that period. Now, let's turn to slide 7 to discuss the key factors impacting our result. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by strong operating results, including $18 million of higher operating earnings from SDG&E in South America; $21 million of higher earnings at our California Utilities, this is largely as a result of the delay of the 2016 GRC file decision, these earnings were recorded in the second quarter of 2016; plus $29 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico related to the GdC and Ventika acquisitions, and higher AFUDC earnings. Also improving earnings this year were $14 million of higher tax benefit and lower interest cost at Parent. These items were partially offset by $34 million of tax benefits in 2016 compared to $3 million of tax expense in 2017 associated with share-based compensation. And at Sempra Mexico, $25 million of lower earnings from foreign currency and inflation effects, primarily from current quarter losses. If you will, I'd like to spend a moment on foreign currency. You'll recall that our current hedging strategy limits our FX-related exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico. While we expect some inter-quarter volatility from time to time, our hedging strategy over the full year is designed to reduce or eliminate expenses related to this exposure. You'll also recall that there are other FX exposures that impact earnings, but not cash flow. These occur in Mexico and South America and we do not hedge these additional costs. These exposures have historically largely offset over a full year when the currency's movement (08:50). You'll find additional details on FX in the appendix. And with that, we'll conclude with our prepared comment and start to take any additional questions that you might have. Operator : Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hey, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Couple of questions. So first on the cost of capital settlement, could you maybe just let us know if there's any additional color you have on why the delay in approving it, and if you don't have any additional color, when do you expect to get some color? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I'm going to have Steve Davis talk a little bit about that. But just to remind everyone, this is an all-party settlement. There were no comments filed against the settlement during the proceeding. The settlement included both ORA and a major consumer group in the state, TURN, as well as the three utilities as part of that. And we have been having meetings, ex parte meetings with Commissioner with all of those five parties present in those meetings to reinforce the settlement. And so, we had a meeting last night. We have more scheduled today, and I will turn it over to Steve to add any more color. Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. I would just add that we continue to believe the settlement or something substantially similar will be approved by the Commission in a timely basis. And we will continue to have further discussions with parties this week and we're hopeful of having a timely decision. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Did they give any indication on why this delay occurred? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : There has been no real indication, but what I will say from my 30 \u2013 almost 40 years of experience is that when you have new Commissioners coming in for a major decision for the first time on that, oftentimes they want to take a little bit more time until they understand the issues. And that it's usually the assigned Commissioner would allow for that to happen. So, we're not reading anything more into it that there's like any major concern. And we're not getting indications of major concerns in the meetings that we had so far. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Secondly, just \u2013 sorry, I have to ask this every call, but just is the Cameron project still on the same timeline as you said at the Analyst Day? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean, ourselves and our partners and our contractors are committed to that timeline. I mean, I asked Joe to talk about some of the processes that we have in place to monitor the project and try to stay on top of it with our partners and our contractors because Joe has been personally involved with those. He also talked to the CEO of CB&I earlier this week. So, Joe? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. Yeah. Debbie mentioned, I did speak with Phil Asherman over the weekend in preparation for this call, as I normally do now. And there is no change in the dates that they gave us and we gave you last fall. And I think it's important to emphasize what Debbie did, the commitment of each of our partners, and as you know, our customers, to get the project finished and into operation is completely there. We have joint venture board meetings regularly. We're all going to go out and see the sites next month when we have our meeting. And everybody is engaged in getting this important project done. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And just any other update on the partner issue? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Go ahead, Joe. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. There's really no update from what I gave at the Analyst Day. I continue to believe and I'm confident that we'll find a common path here to a solution, but as I mentioned, it's complex, and we have to negotiate all these things, and it requires unanimous consent as I mentioned. So, I don't have a particular date of when we're going to get it done, but it's clearly one of my priorities, and I'm focused on it, and I'm actively working on it with my team and with the partners. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Steve. Operator : We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin of UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Good afternoon. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So, quick first question here, more focused on the quarter than anything else. Can you elaborate a little bit more on \u2013 I think the gas marketing was the \u2013 what you guys talked about in the deck. What was the source of that $26 million higher earnings a little bit, and how should we think about that on a go-forward basis? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I mean, that \u2013 we always have given you indications of kind of information on how gas prices affect our business and we have that information in the appendix. Part of what you're looking at is the change of gas prices year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, but I'll have Jeff take you through that, and in particular to have you understand kind of what we think is going to happen for the remainder of the year. So, Jeff? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Good afternoon, Julien. On the $26 million improvement, roughly $15 million of that is from mark-to-market losses in the quarter last year. And as Debbie indicated, obviously, the natural gas prices have improved just over $1. I would also mention that at the end of this year you'll think about the ENI contract will be rolling off. And I think if I was to guide you in terms of how we think about the year, this segment we showed you at the analyst conference would report roughly $40 million to $50 million of negative results for the year, and we still think that's the best way to think about it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Excellent. Can you elaborate any further successes? I know we're just a few weeks out in terms of the Peruvian bid or anything like that, and also in terms of Mexico on the marketing effort, those \u2013 both seems somewhat tangible (15:35)? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. As you say, it's only been 30 days out, Julien, but in that 30 days, we did announce a new solar project in Mexico. And we \u2013 if we think to answer the Mexico question first, is there's some wonderful opportunities in terms of renewables there. A lot of bids will be going out for additional renewable resources to meet the standards that have been set by Mexico. And then, what's significant about the Pima project is it's one of the very first projects to be assigned with an industrial customer. And we think that that's a really interesting market to have some opportunities to directly sign up with some of the commercial and industrial customers to provide them renewable resources. Also on Mexico, we're still expecting bids coming out on the electric transmission side. And as we told you at the conference, we think there's some great opportunities to continue our efforts in the liquids side of the business, and don't have anything specific to announce in that area. But we see a lot of interest in finding a partner like IEnova to build the infrastructure on the liquid side of the business. And as you know, we already have an ethane pipeline and a terminal and so we've been in that business and we think it has some great opportunities for us. On the Peruvian pipeline, I will ask Steve Davis to add any color to that, but what I will tell you is that it looks like that that project will go out for bid and that it's likely to go out for bid later this year or the beginning of next year. And our focus has been on ensuring that the bid turns will allow for a truly competitive bid process with participants that are concerned about not taking on any Foreign Corrupt Practice Act responsibilities. And as you know, we backed away from that when we felt that we could not get the kind of a clean deal that we felt that we could execute on. And so, we have had some meetings with the government officials, encouraging them to create a bid that ensures that the project is going to be financeable, and that there will be adequate opportunities to bid in the way that the bid is structured. Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything more to that? Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy : Yeah. The only thing I would add, Julien, as you know, we talked a little bit about this at the analyst conference, and we obviously know a lot about the project. And as Debbie had mentioned, we are having discussions with the government. And to the extent that it fits our risk profile, we'll take another look at it and we expect something to happen either later this year or the first part of next year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Excellent. Sorry, going back to the first question real quickly, Jeff, did I hear you right saying something about a contract rolling off? How does that impact the sensitivity, just really quickly to clarify? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : I think that you'll recall that the \u2013 ENI was one of the original contracting parties at Cameron, and that contract is rolling off within the year. And what we're really basically saying is, next year, you will not have the benefit of that contract. Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy : And, Julien, that's the regas contract. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Right. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean, this has been part of what we've told you all along that we want to remind you that that \u2013 because we start \u2013 I mean, it's a good thing \u2013 because we start the testing of the first train in the beginning of next year, we cannot have export going on at the same time as import. And so, that contract has to stop so that we can begin the testing of the trains for the export. And that impacts us financially later this year, and the beginning of next year, always have been incorporated into our base plans. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. But that reduces the sensitivity, just to be clear, the gas sensitivity? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Not really. It's \u2013 I mean, it's probably about a $5 million benefit this year and zero next year. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Sorry to belabor it. Thank you, all. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. It's a \u2013 if your question is, does that reduces sensitivity to gas prices, no, because it's really not dependent upon gas prices. The gas price sensitivity is really tied to the ECA plant and attained good (19:55) contract at the ECA plant, plus any gas in storage and have volatility during the course of the year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. That's what I thought. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Okay. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. One quick one just on the utilities, the Mobile Home Meter and the CIS projects. Those were not included in your base CapEx, but they were included in I think your upside scenarios, what's \u2013 can you kind of just walk us through what's changed in the last four or five weeks? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. We've actually made our filing on the CIS project for SDG&E and about $250 million project. So, now we're beginning the regulatory process on that and that happened since the analyst conference. And then, do you want to talk a bit about the Master Meter, because there are some differences between the two utilities and how that moves forward? Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy : Sure, Debbie. Hi, Michael. As I had mentioned at the analyst conference and that looking at some of the incremental capital opportunities, they were both highlighted and we talked about quarter two filings of which we made a filing on the 28th and then one just on Friday for the Master Meter project. So, both are in alignment with what our plan is. The CapEx associated with the SDG&E Customer Information System is about $250 million and that the gas company for the Mobile Home Park, it's about a $270 million capital project. So, both are solid projects and we look forward to timely approval of those going forward. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: When do you think spend \u2013 how long do you think the regulatory approval process will likely be, and when do you think the capital \u2013 and what's the timeline for the capital to actually occur or actually be spend? Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy : Well, the good news is we've had two very successful pilot projects at both SDG&E and the gas company. So, the Commission is very well aware of our track record, and so we think we will get a timely decision likely in into 2018 and we would begin immediately after the approval. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And, Joe, I want to come back a little bit to the Cameron project. And I know you talked with Phil from CBI, but also note that in their earnings call yesterday, one of Phil's colleagues, Patrick Mullen, used the comment when asked about Cameron LNG and the start-up, and I'll quote, \"We expect the phased start-up of these three trains starting in the latter half of next year\". That may have just been kind of bundling of Train 1 and Train 2 with one supposed to be mid-year and one supposed to be at the end of the year, or you could interpret that as, hey, everything is moving a little bit more again. Would love your thoughts if any. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Joe, why don't you go ahead and... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Michael. I obviously read that as well and I think you can read it a number of different ways. I think what he was saying wasn't different from what my discussion with Phil was because I've been in a number of conversations with Pat and I think they believe that they are in the schedule that they gave us. So, I think he was just commenting altogether, he basically said all the trains are moving toward getting into operation in the second part of the year, which is very consistent with what we said. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Joe. Much appreciated. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hi. How are you doing? So, a lot of my questions have been answered, but just a few quick ones. So, I was wondering how the Australian LNG curtailment potential might impact you guys. What kind of opportunities you guys might see or just in general what it means for the market? So, that was my first question. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I'm going to have Joe go through it in more details, but what I will say is that we've been saying all along that we saw a market opportunity in the 2021 to 2023 period. And I think now the kind of the herd mentality is where we've been all along. And that's why we've moved forward. We're trying to get Port Arthur in the marketing stage where we are right now. And while we're trying to get the issues with Cameron Train 4 resolved so that we can get into the market for that. And I think what you're seeing is what we have been predicting all along as if there was going to be a demand need in the market come that kind of timeframe, and that's why we've continued to work on development of our projects. Joe, do you want to talk about the Australian curtailments? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Sure. Hi, Paul. I guess I would say it this way, I think that the long-term users of LNG both in Asia and Europe are looking for long-term solutions and reliability. And so they want to make sure that they're going to a source where they can see that over a long term. And I can say that the meetings that we had together with Woodside where we were jointly marketing the Port Arthur facility went very well and there's quite a lot of interest in that facility. And I think that what's going on in Australia it just shows that not necessarily getting these things done means that always that that's going to be available or available for a longer period of time. So, I'm not sure it's going to have an immediate effect, but it starts to show that the end users are seriously starting to contemplate the need to go FID pretty soon, if not this year, next year or into the next year so that they can make sure that they meet the needs that they have, and don't get in trouble if something like that were to become more serious. And so, I think that having Woodside along with us has been very good for the project and for us. So, we look forward to trying to get these things signed up. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So, it's been positive for the most part, and \u2013 but you don't actually see any sort of near-term potential opportunities that are going to be developed (26:42) if I'm understanding what you guys are saying, is that right? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : I would like to make sure I understand your question. You're talking about near-term development projects in Australia or here? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : No. No. I mean, with you guys. I mean, if you're having curtailments, that would suggest that people might have concerns about \u2013 first of all, what does it mean for just LNG sales in the near term in the market, what does it mean in terms of tightening up the market perhaps in Asia? And then secondly, does it make \u2013 and it sounds like you were saying that it does, does it make people more interested in something like Port Arthur or are there opportunities that you guys are exploring in terms of getting supply that may not be as \u2013 I'm sorry, that may not have as much risk perhaps associated with it as something like we're seeing in Australia? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I mean, we have talked to you all about what we saw as the advantages of the U.S. project, over these projects with dedicated supply sources because of the supply it dries up or that there's a problem of getting that supply to market. And in the U.S. market, you don't have one dedicated supply source for the gas. And you also have the ability to sell off the gas at liquid points in the U.S. if you don't want to take the gas. I actually think that what's happening in Australia and in some of these other locations where the supply source starts to get more constrained makes it way better for the U.S. in terms of marketing our projects. And so that's the opportunity that we see right now. And I think Woodside's seen the similar view, they've been very excited about our Port Arthur project from the beginning. And I think, being an Australian company, they see the benefit of that as well. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, great. And then the second question I have is that we're seeing \u2013 there was an announcement last \u2013 yesterday on some immigration enforcement by the DOJ with respect to another LNG facility. And we've also been hearing in other industries potential issues with immigration raising construction prices, delaying in-service dates and stuff. And I was just wondering \u2013 or at least the risk that's being perceived to that, I'm just wondering if that \u2013 is it all an issue that you guys are thinking about in terms of just as a cost and scheduling with LNG. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I'm going to have Joe \u2013 because we just read the news report and we checked into it. It's not our project and we have controls in our project that should allow us not to have this kind of a situation occur. Joe, do you have any... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. So, I think as she just said, we saw this article this morning and didn't \u2013 we haven't heard that, so that didn't sound like it was us. I checked. It wasn't us, it wasn't CC JV, and it wasn't their contractors, and we have controls in place around that. Also, you heard on the call yesterday, Phil mentioned that they were employing a great number of people, and they have a huge roster of people that they go to to bring people onsite. And they haven't really had problems bringing people onto the site. So, I think their controls are very sound, and we haven't seen this problem. Obviously, one of the reasons that we hired this consortium of contractors to work on this project was they have a large resource of people to go to, to bring to the site, and very much though in Louisiana. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I didn't mean to suggest it was your facility. I guess what I... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : There was a comment that if a news article that it was. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Oh there was? Okay, I'm sorry. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, there was. Yeah. That's why we had it checked right before the call. So... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Yeah, I checked as well. But just an \u2013 and FYI, though, I guess, just a \u2013 sort of a derivative to that is \u2013 and I don't mean to belabor this, but are you seeing any issue with any of your projects, LNG or otherwise with respect to this issue of \u2013 we're hearing this from the building sector, et cetera, that like they're having significant concerns about access to labor due in part to limitations on immigration and more immigration enforcement. Have you heard of anything? Was that \u2013 is that something that's coming up in terms of costs or anything that you're hearing about in general in the market? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : We have not, actually, Paul, and we do talk about this when we meet with the contractors. And they seem to have ready access to labor and have not brought this up as an issue. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : That concludes the time that we have for questions at this point. I would now turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Reed for closing remarks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, thanks again, for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact our IR team. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Davis - Sempra Energy Analysts : Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sempra Energy Second Quarter Earnings Call. Please note that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's second quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With me in San Diego are several members of our management team : Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 4, 2017, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4. Let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Rick. This morning, we reported second quarter EPS of $1.03 or $1.10 on an adjusted basis. With these great year-to-date results, we are increasing our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. The increase in our guidance is a direct result of our strong year-to-date earnings which Jeff will review with you later, combined with our expectations for continued strong financial performance for the remainder of the year. Our businesses are performing well, and we've had some great success in securing growth projects for our future. Some highlights that I will detail later are since our analyst conference, we've made significant progress on our strategic investments, adding over $1 billion in new projects with approximately $500 million coming from projects we filed for at our California utilities. In addition, we received two positive regulatory outcomes that improved the clarity of our expected financial returns and allow us to increase the amount of gas stored at Aliso Canyon by reinstating injections. We expect positive developments across our businesses to completely offset the 2018 impact of a further Cameron delay, which I will discuss in a moment. Based on these developments, we are affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. We expect to give updated 2018 segment guidance and 2019 guidance early next year. Now please turn to the next slide where I will discuss the update to the Cameron schedule. Cameron and the joint venture partners continue to monitor Cameron's construction progress. Our observations are that certain aspects of the work may be ahead of schedule, but many others are behind the schedule we received last October. As a result, Cameron has continued to question the contractor, and recently, the contractor notified us that its Cameron's schedule has changed. Based on several factors, we think it is reasonable to expect that Train 1 could be delayed into 2019, with Trains 2 and 3 following throughout 2019. These factors include an updated schedule from the contractor, Cameron's own review of the schedule, and the inherent risks in constructing and testing these types of facilities. The contractor and JV partners are assessing reasons for the schedule change and working through the issues. All parties are focused on bringing the three trains into service as soon as practical. Let me be clear. We are disappointed in the most recent change and the impact on our near-term earnings and cash flow. We have revised our 2018 financial plan to assume no earnings from Cameron in 2018. But as I mentioned, the expected strength of our other businesses allows us to affirm our 2018 guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. We also continue to expect our earnings from Cameron in 2020 to be in the $300 million to $350 million range. In the long term, we don't foresee any material impact to Cameron's economics. When we developed the project, we built in risk mitigation provisions in our contract such as the lump sum turnkey EPC contract with schedule and cost overrun protection. I will end this slide on an additional point many of you have asked us about. During large construction projects like Cameron, contractors often assert that they are owed additional compensation, schedule extension, or both. While Cameron has received information from the contractor claiming they are owed amounts beyond the contract value, sufficient details have not been provided to enable an evaluation of the validity or the amount. The contractors informed us that they will supplement the information at a future day. I will reiterate : we expect the protections we put in place to keep Cameron's long-term economics materially the same. We think it is important to share with you the progress that has been made on this project site. Please go to the next slide. This slide shows a photo of the Cameron site as of mid-July. As you can see, a lot of work is getting done. That said, we will continue to monitor the progress against the schedule to help ensure that safety and long-term reliability of the project is not being compromised. Now, turn to the next slide. We have listed some of the most important and relevant accomplishments to date, which give a sense of how far construction has progressed. I'll mention a few. 100% of the engineering work has been completed, nearly 100% of the procurement is completed, and all three heat exchangers have been laid on their foundation. Finally, this project has our full attention, and I want to emphasize how important it is to us. I also know that it's important to all of you. With that, I'll hand it off to Jeff who will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276 million or $1.10 per share. This also compares favorably to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2016 of $200 million or $0.79 per share. Next, let's turn to slide 9 to discuss the key factors impacting these results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by healthy operating results that include : $23 million due to higher earnings from LNG marketing activities in 2017 and losses in the second quarter of 2016 that were related to gas price movement on inventories sold forward, $21 million of higher operational earnings, primarily from acquisitions and pipelines placed into service in Mexico, $16 million from higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E, and finally, $11 million from higher earnings due to U.S. renewable assets that were placed into service in 2016, as well as increased production across the portfolio this year. The strong operational results that I discussed for Mexico were more than offset by $12 million of losses in the current quarter related to foreign currency and inflation effects. This compares to a $16 million benefit last year. I'd also like to emphasize that assuming current rates, $30 million of additional hedge income is expected to be booked in the second half of the year and largely offset the year-to-date FX losses at Mexico. And with that, I'll hand it back to Debbie, who will go over our business updates. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Jeff. As I mentioned earlier, we've added over $1 billion of new investments. I'll describe several that we've added since our last quarterly call. Let me start with Mexico. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to IEnova's Analyst Day in June where the team identified $45 billion of potential market opportunities through 2025. Of this $45 billion, approximately $10 billion are in the newly opened liquids infrastructure business. I discussed at our Analyst Day that I thought this was an excellent growth area for us. IEnova has started to expand its strategic footprint into this area and had some positive recent developments. Specifically, IEnova will develop three liquids terminals, two of which will be in the high consumption areas of Mexico City and Puebla, and the third in the Port of Veracruz. The facilities all have long-term firm U.S. dollar denominated capacity agreements with Valero. In addition, the expected total CapEx for the projects is $275 million and all are planned to go into service through 2019. Valero has the option to purchase 50% equity ownership in all of the facilities when they go into service. We hope to continue to build our strategic partnership with Valero as projects like these fit IEnova and Sempra's core competency. Most importantly, these projects will lay a solid foundation for us to expand this new business line into additional inland and marine terminal opportunities as well as liquids transportation investments. Just as we did with our natural gas pipeline, we see the opportunities for solid returns and great growth by being an early mover in this market. Moving to Chile, we were awarded transmission project through our joint venture for approximately $50 million. The project is expected to go into service in 2021 and continues to build on our growing transmission business in Chile. Finally, we are constructing a new 200-megawatt solar project in California. This facility is fully contracted for an average of 18 years and is expected to go into service in phases through the first half of 2018. Please turn to the next slide. Starting with the cost of capital, we were pleased that the all party settlement was upheld extending, the certainty of our ROEs through 2019. This decision provides greater clarity of our planned earnings at our California utilities. Also at SoCalGas, we received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field to a target level of approximately 24 Bcf, and have started to do so. While the recent approval to resume gas injections is positive news, we remain concerned about system reliability this summer and in the coming winter given, the length of time it took to receive this decision, as well as the limitations on targeted gas storage levels. We are working cooperatively with the agencies to help ensure we safely operate the Aliso Canyon storage field within the authority we have been granted. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we have filed applications at the CPUC for two projects, representing an incremental $500 million of rate based investments, comprised of the Master-Metered Mobilehome Park and a new customer information system at SDG&E. Before I turn to our guidance, I'll highlight that adding and filing for over $1 billion of new development projects across our utility and infrastructure businesses is a testament to our strong growth platforms and our ability to capture opportunities. We continue to make significant progress on the projects and our plans, while also evaluating and advancing projects like those we've added since the analyst conference. Please turn to the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, for the second time this year, we are raising our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. On a GAAP basis, our increased 2017 EPS guidance range is $4.95 to $5.25. The key contributors driving this increase are strong year-to-date earnings, accelerated capital deployment and disciplined cost management across our businesses. We expect these key operational drivers to continue into 2018 and to completely offset the delay in Cameron. This has enabled us to affirm our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. Please turn to the last slide. To recap, we've accomplished a great deal over the last several months. First, we are making significant progress on our strategic investments with over $1 billion added since our analyst conference. Second, we received positive regulatory outcomes at the California utilities on two important matters : the cost of capital extension; and reinstating injection at Aliso Canyon. And third, we raised 2017 adjusted EPS guidance and affirmed 2018 EPS guidance on a strong expected operational performance. With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you might have. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks and congratulations on a great quarter. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Several questions. Listen, I heard your script and I understand your reticence to get too granular on guidance in the context of the change in the Cameron service date being offset by improvements elsewhere. But can you talk to, at a high level, how much of that improvement in 2018 that's offsetting the Cameron delay is coming from new projects versus just better expected returns in either the utilities businesses or the existing infrastructure businesses. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. Let me kind of walk you through because I think it is important for you to understand that. Because the key thing is that these are improvements that we believe are sustainable going forward. And we've really been working throughout 2017 to put these kinds of things in place and then to build upon them in 2018 and 2019. So, let me hit the highlights of the key areas. First, last year, we got about $1.4 billion of incremental capital approved in our utilities that was outside of a rate case capital. And so these are incremental projects. And we've been really focused on how we can expedite getting those projects in service, beginning the collection of AFUDC and then putting into service in the rate base. And then we filed for another $500 million worth of projects that I mentioned in my talking points. So, the utility performance has been very strong and it's really based upon the deployment of additional capital largely. And then we are building on another 200-megawatt solar project in California. And that will go into service throughout 2018. And so we will have that on an ongoing basis producing earnings. In Mexico, we've had a lot of new projects that we've announced. We have a solar project with the Pima Solar. Now we have these liquids terminals that we'll be constructing throughout 2018 into 2019. And then we've just had really strong performance from all of our businesses in terms of being very efficient in the operations, which is something we believe can continue. So everything we're looking at in 2018 is, in my mind, totally focused on better performance and performance that we can continue beyond 2018. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Fantastic. Thank you. My second question goes to what's happening at Cameron. And you gave a very detailed explanation, so thank you. But given the track record CB&I has had with other projects with delays, how can you be confident that this is the sort of final straw and there aren't going to be further delays? And have you sort of built in some thinking around that in the new schedule you've given us, or is the new schedule you've given us sort of completely in sync with like specifically what they have told you is their current expectation? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : What they told us is only one piece of the thinking. And trust me, we've done a lot of thinking on this. And then we brought in consultants from the outside who have been working with us to look at all of the scheduled documents, look at the onsite work that have been done, and then give us their independent assessment of the schedule and when we think that the trains can come into service. So what we're giving you today is our best estimate based upon all of the work that's been done by the 70-plus people we have on site as part of the JV, the outside firms that we've been using to validate the information, and then looking at what we've gotten from our contractor, and then just looking at how things can affect projects. And so it's our best estimate based upon all of those factors, not just what the contractor has given us. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. And you commented on the fact that CB&I or this joint venture with \u2013 CB&I has with Chiyoda, has indicated that they'd like to be paid more money. It's not clear to you at this point that their claims are valid. Is there any way for you at this point to sort of quantify the types of dollars we're talking about? And if you can or you can't, that being said, how is the contract structured so that you are protected if you have to deploy more capital? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I'm going to have Joe go through this because he has been on the ground working on these issues. So, Joe? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Greg. So let me talk about that. I've spoken about this before. The thing that we looked at when we entered into this project was a very risk-mitigated approach. And so we did, with our partners at Cameron JV, sign a lump sum turnkey agreement, and we expect to hold the contractor joint venture to that agreement. And like most construction projects, people will come along with claims and ask for different things, and that's the normal course. I'm not going to go into the specifics of the dollars because we do not have enough information to even review it, audit it, or anything else. And so I don't want to talk about dollars. And one of the reasons is very important for you all to remember. This is really not a Sempra issue. We are protected throughout the agreements that we've signed on this issue, primarily through the EPC lump-sum turnkey agreement, and we expect them to perform under that contract. But also through our other contracts, we're protected. Our economics are going to be protected. Of course, as Debbie said, we're disappointed in the earnings movement. But we're confident about getting the value out of this project. And I think that's what we should focus on when you're talking to us about Sempra's impact from these kinds of cost issues. Does that help? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : That's the best you're going to tell me, then that helps. Thanks, guys. Take care. Operator : All right. And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan from Citibank. Please go ahead. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, Debbie. Did you guys issue any change orders to the contractor at all? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No, we didn't issue change orders to the contractor. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Let me just \u2013 let me just \u2013 throughout the course of the contract, there's been one change order for $12 million. That's it. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : That's it. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Okay, understood. That's the only question on Cameron. And then just on the sort of CCA issue that sort of seems to be ongoing in the news, do you guys have any update on what's going on in your territory with some of these aggregation sort of topics? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, that's a great question because from the Sempra standpoint, we really support the customers having choice and we like the ability of customers having the choice to go to a CCA because we basically earn our money based upon them using our transmission and distribution systems. And so if they want go to another party for procurement, that's great. The problem that we have in California is ensuring that when those customers exit, they take all of the costs with them. So, I'm going to have Steve talk about the work that we're doing at the Commission now to have them meet the state law in California, which requires customers exiting to take all of their costs. Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Faisel. As Debbie mentioned, our focus really is on ensuring that the Commission complies with current law, which requires departing load to take their fair share of costs. And the three IOUs have put forward a solution to that at the Commission that we're hopeful will be voted on by the end of this year. So to the extent that when there is departing load and they take their costs, that's fine and we just need to make sure that going forward, the Commission complies with that law and we have a solution to do that. I would like to just say, though, keep in mind that in California, our rates are decoupled and our generation rate base investment is less than 10%. So, we're not long on generation obviously. In San Diego, we don't have any CCA providers. We do have some cities that are looking at it. And one of the key issues in variables as they look at this issue is what the Commission is doing in compliance with state law on the departing load charges. So that's a key issue in variable which is causing the cities to take a second look at things. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, got it. And actually I misspoke. There's one more question on Cameron just on \u2013 follow up to Greg's question on the schedule. Does that include any sort of disruptions from weather at all in the hurricane season? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I'll let Joe come in, too. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Faisel. So let me tell you why I have confidence in what we're projecting for you. We have \u2013 and Debbie said, 70 people. We actually now \u2013 we keep increasing. We have about 120 people on the site, and the engineering capacity is looking at what's going on in the site. So we know what's going on in the site. We also have multiple external consultants there reviewing the work and the process. In reviewing the forecast forward, what do we see going forward? And as the work continues to progress, as you see in the photograph, there's lots of work to finish so that would naturally cause you to be a little bit more confident in it, yet we do have to take into account things like weather, so as our consultants and we look at it, we take into account the normal course of events in the Gulf Coast. What I would say is not in there is unexpected events. If there was a major disruption from a major hurricane in 2017 or 2018, that would probably cause some change, but it's hard to say because it depends where the hurricane hits, how much time is away. You know that recent storm, Cindy, that they had, they were away from the site like a day-and-a-half. So it kind of depends on the severity of it, but we do, in our own analysis, build in the normal kind of weather issues that confront contractors in the Gulf of Mexico. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Fair enough. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Faisel. Operator : And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning, or afternoon. I guess, first, a couple of questions on Cameron. So the third point you made in terms of the delay that kind of you included the inherent risk in constructing and testing. So that is it fair to say, there's some cushion that you've kind of put into this update? I mean, we'll hear from CB&I I guess on Monday when they report. So, there could be some maybe difference potentially in the timelines there? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : We just used all the data that we had available and really looked at the work being done by our outside consultants against what the contractor had given us and gave our best estimate of when we think the trains will come on in 2019. So I mean, we looked at all the factors we had before us and it's our best estimate for that. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then also, any color that you could give on how the relationships are with the partners going through this process and the like? Any color there? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, since Joe meets with them about every week, I'll have Joe talk about that. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. We have a good relationship with our partners. I mean, remember, our partners are also our customers. And we had a pretty lengthy call with them yesterday. I met with them a couple of weeks ago in Houston. I'm in Houston quite a bit. As we got these schedules, I was poring through the schedules with them and with our engineering teams. I think it's a very constructive relationship, and they have two roles to play there. They're both our partners on the equity side and they are our customers. And so we are working closely together. We're all aligned even with the contractor consortium to try to get this done as soon as possible. But obviously, people have different views on things, but I think we have a good relationship with them. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then last question just on the offsets, specifically on the utility side, I guess, Debbie, you mentioned like $1.4 billion of capital approved outside the rate case. Could you just give a little better sense of are these other projects getting recovered through other mechanisms outside GRC, or it's kind of AFUDC type benefits they are \u2013 yeah. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Most of the projects that are in the $1.4 billion are FERC projects. So you get AFUDC on the projects during construction and then as they are completed, they immediately go into rate base because we use like actual rate base for FERC. So you don't have to go back to the CPUC and try to recover the rate base amount after, it just trues up on the actual rate base based upon what actual rate bases that you are in and so the majority of these are at SDG&E and the majority of them are FERC related. And then on some of the other areas, there are regulatory mechanisms that are put in place outside of the rate case to recover costs that are CPUC related. So we don't have to wait for a rate case. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Chris Turnure from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. I wanted to talk about new LNG in Port Arthur in particular or you had an announcement during the quarter there that you had I think signed a preliminary agreement with Korea. Could you just maybe put that in context and specifically talk about the MOU that you had at Port Arthur already, how this would work and maybe how if at all this is differentiated from some of the other companies that made announcements at the same time in regards to agreements with Korea? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. We had an agreement with KOGAS and we made an announcement about having a memorandum of understanding with them to hopefully come to some conclusion for them to become a buyer and potentially a foundation buyer which would allow them to take some equity in the Port Arthur facility. And I think part of the differentiators that we found in the market is that there are some buyers who like to take some equity in the projects as well and as KOGAS has expressed an interest in that, we're hoping to get one to three foundation buyers that would take equity positions, and then sell the rest of the gas that's produced to other. So, it was really great to have the biggest \u2013 I guess, the second largest LNG buyer in the world want to be in our project and want to have equity in our project. And so, we're in the process of marketing now. We'll also be continuing our discussions with KOGAS to finalize agreements. But we thought it was really positive news. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then, shifting gears back to Cameron. I know we've had a couple of questions on the topic already, of course, but you used the language that kind of indicated the project could spill into \u2013 start in 2019. So I think one of the earlier questions spoke to a range of potential outcomes. What's the base case start-up for each train right now? And is your assessment here something that was kind of pushed to you by CB&I, and then you felt like you had to kind of give us this information, or conversely do you feel like you were kind of getting out ahead of what they're saying and this is a relatively I guess conservative view on what could happen? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Let me just kind of talk about what's happened and how we got to this point because I think it's important for you to understand the level of monitoring and meetings and questions and everything that we have with a contractor. Once they gave us a detailed schedule back in October, then we've hired outside firms to work with us, and then we have all these people on site to monitor performance against the schedule. And what we started to see is certain things on that schedule being done sooner than the schedule indicated, and other things being done on a schedule later than was indicated. And what we wanted to understand is really kind of what the critical path was on the project and what does that mean to the end day on the project, because when you have a combination of things getting done faster and things getting done later, it's really hard to determine what the overall impact was. So we brought in outside consultants. We spent time with the contractor that \u2013 they gave us some dates that they felt that they could meet. We had our consultants, and I'll review all of that type of information, and we came to some of our own conclusions. And our conclusions are that, from our standpoint, we feel that we don't want to have any earnings in our financial plans for 2018 for Cameron. We don't want to assume that risk, and we want to give you guidance without any earnings from Cameron. If something wonderful happens and it comes in early, that's great. But from our standpoint, from the information that we have, we just felt it was best to take all of the earnings out for Cameron in 2018, and then focus on what we could do as a management team to get to our guidance without having any of Cameron. And we have some great opportunities to offset Cameron. And we just thought it was the right thing to do and that's the way we approached it. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful context and color there. You mentioned that CB&I came to you with an updated version of the schedule when that was one piece of the equation in your overall analysis here. If they had not done that, I guess I would ask, would you have kind of come to the same conclusion? Would you have given us this updated schedule as it exists right now? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : We would have... Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And the work that you had done preceding that. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean, we would have used all the information available to do our assessment of what's the right thing for our company and our guidance that we gave you. And that's exactly what we did in this case. And then the schedule that we have from CB&I doesn't have a lot of details and everything on it. So we still have to work through that. But we have to tell you what we believe based upon all the data that we have, and we would have done that whether or not we had a schedule. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got you. Thanks, Debbie. Operator : All right. We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey guys. A couple of different ones. First of all, SoCalGas in the second half of 2017, is there anything unusual when we should think about the earnings bridge from the second half of 2016 and the second half of 2017 at either SoCalGas or SDG&E? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No, not really from year-to-year at the two utilities. I mean, I think the big thing that happened at both utilities is we got our attrition allowance year-over-year. And then to the degree we manage costs within that attrition allowance, that gives us some upside. But year-over-year, the companies have done pretty well, when you look at quarter-to-quarter. If you look at on an annualized basis, as you know, there's seasonality at SoCalGas, but there was seasonality at SoCalGas last year as well. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And one thing, can you talk a little bit about you've got the new renewables - Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : One thing, Michael. I just want to remind you, and we had this and all the data last year and I was assuming you weren't talking about things like this, but we did have an impairment last year at SoCalGas within our South pipeline that we reported in the quarter last year. But that was in the information that we had disclosed (37:47). But there was nothing else between the two companies that was really different year-to-year. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And on Sempra Renewables, how are you looking at over the next couple of years, the potential to add to that backlog or add to that pipeline of potential solar plants? And can you remind us, what's the amount of \u2013 I don't know the right term for it, but literally the land or the sites that you currently control, what's kind of the amount of megawatts you could add over a very long period of time, if you were able to get the contracts? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean, there's several hundred megawatts capability at each of those locations. I think you're talking about our two solar locations. And there are several hundred megawatts of capability there. We're focused on developing those and we have been bidding those into RFPs, and then looking at other ways that we might be able to add value on those sites with maybe adding some batteries and being able to do peak-shaving. So we have our existing sites that are expandable and then we're also developing new sites. And a lot of our new sites are really developed in the Midwest area with customers we've already done business with and adding wind, which is very economical in a lot of those locations. And we have a lot of customers that we've already done business with that are interested in either expanding an existing site or adding a new site. So we're doing a lot of work in that area. And then as I mentioned, we have contracts now to build a 200-megawatt solar project in California as well that we just talked about. So I mean it's a business that we think has growth potential. There's a lot of states that are very interested with renewable portfolio standards and with the economics being there for wind and solar now. But it's one of our growth areas but I wouldn't say that we have changed significantly our capital plans in that area from what we showed you at the Analyst conference. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks Debbie. Much appreciated. Operator : All right. And we will take our last question from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Hi. Just following up on that question. The 200-megawatt solar contract that you just announced, that was not at your existing facilities. This is a new project altogether to do \u2013 because it's coming online so soon, is it something that was already in development when you bought it? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. It was a project that was in early-stage development. We bought the project and are building it out. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: And do you have a contract with I guess one of the IOUs in California? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : We have average 18 year contracts with a number of parties, some municipalities, a variety of parties where they offtake. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: And in terms of the cost, you talked about having over $1 billion of new capital since the Analyst Day. But adding it all up, unless you got this solar project virtually for free, it must be more than $1 billion. So just wondering if you could give any indication of the CapEx associated with that? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No. We don't give the CapEx associated with individuals but it is over $1 billion. If you add everything up, it's over $1 billion, so. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Okay. And then, just on Cameron. I'm a little confused about the contract terms. You said today that it was a fixed price turnkey contract. And in the past, I thought you had said that to the extent that there were incremental costs associated with building Cameron, that the cost to build would go up, but that your ROE would stay the same. And the way that would happen would be that the higher cost to build would be essentially passed through to customers. So, where am I wrong? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : You're not wrong. That's the way that contract is written. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : That is what I tried to say. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: So... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : I said it's not a Sempra issue, Leslie, we're protected. We have the contract protections with the contractor, that's the primary. But we also have other protections in our other contracts that keep us whole on a return basis and you have exactly right. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: And so, how are you thinking about Train 4 at this point? Has your thinking shifted on that? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I would say our focus is on Train 1 through 3 right now and getting those done. So we have been having meetings with the partners to look at development of further trains on the site. And Joe just was at a meeting a few weeks ago. I think we're making some progress but I don't expect anything to be resolved before the end of the year. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn it back over to Debbie Reed for closing remarks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Householder - Sempra Energy Analysts : Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sempra Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With me in San Diego are Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and CEO; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, October 30, 2017; and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4; and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Rick. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.22 or $1.04 on an adjusted basis. We reported year-to-date earnings per share of $2.99 or $3.87 on an adjusted basis. Based on these strong year-to-date results, we expect to be at the upper end of our 2017 adjusted earnings guidance range of $5 to $5.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, our updated 2017 earnings guidance range is $4.13 to $4.43 per share. Excluded from adjusted earnings this quarter was the impairment of SDG&E's wildfire regulatory asset, which I will discuss later. On this call, I want to update you on actions we have taken to implement our growth strategy, including plans to create value from the Oncor transaction. I will also review our General Rate Case filings at our California Utilities and the requested rate base to continue to run safe and reliable systems. Before I review each of these, please turn to the next slide, where Jeff will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff? Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $57 million, or $0.22 per share. This compares to third quarter 2016 earnings of $622 million, or $2.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $265 million, or $1.04 per share. This is in line with third quarter adjusted earnings in 2016 of $259 million, or $1.02 per share. Please turn to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned, our year-to-date adjusted earnings have been strong and are 11% higher than last year. The quarterly variances are explained in the business unit summary section. The key takeaway from our results is that we're on track to deliver strong full-year earnings. And with that, let's move to slide 7; and I'll turn it back over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Jeff. From time to time, it's important for us to take a step back and talk about how our projects and acquisitions fit within our strategy. At our Analyst Conference, we discussed two important strategic goals for Sempra through 2021. First, we expect to deliver roughly double the long-term earnings growth rate of our utility peers. And second, we plan superior dividend growth of 8% to 9%. These were set before consideration of the significant opportunities we've been executing on this year. I'd like to highlight our success in growing our business in the six months since our Analyst Conference. We have captured or filed for approximately $1.9 billion in incremental opportunities that were not part of our plan. We also announced the Oncor transaction, which we expect to be accretive to EPS during our plan period. It also adds a new strategic growth platform in the U.S., while helping us maintain the approximately 75/25 U.S./international earnings mix in our portfolio. And our California Utilities submitted their General Rate Case filings, which seeks significant increases in revenue requirements for 2019 needed to continue providing safe and reliable service to customers. Please turn to the next slide. Collectively, the new projects add approximately $1.9 billion of additional investments. I would like to highlight our most recent project addition. We announced the pending acquisition of Pemex's 25% equity interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline for approximately $520 million, bringing IEnova's total ownership to 50%. We expect the transaction to close by the end of this year. Most of these projects come online later in 2018 and beyond, and we expect that they will improve our growth in the latter years of our plan. We have also seen improved operating performance in cash flows from our core businesses. This improved performance coupled with the additional projects should allow us to offset some of the 2019 impact of the previously announced Cameron delay. And just to confirm, there's no change at Cameron as we continue to expect Trains 1 through 3 to producing LNG in 2019. As you can see, since the Analyst Conference, we have developed growth projects across our businesses, and we believe our portfolio mix will allow us to continue to grow earnings at rates roughly double that of traditional utilities, while maintaining a utility-like risk profile. Please turn to the next slide. When you look at our existing platform, it's easy to see how Oncor is a great strategic fit. This business has a strong management team and is focused on achieving above-average growth through transmission and distribution investment that create value for customers and shareholders. Oncor manages a large rate base similar to our California Utilities, and adding it to our portfolio increases Sempra's U.S.-based utility earnings mix. Further, Texas is a constructive business environment with above-average customer and energy's growth. This acquisition provides meaningful expected accretion and also strengthens our expected credit profile in future years, giving us further balance sheet flexibility to continue to invest in growth. I would like to highlight the last point. From the strengthening credit profile provided by Oncor and the ongoing earnings accretion from the transaction, we expect to have $1 billion to $1.5 billion of credit capacity in the outer years of our plan, which should provide us with approximately the same credit profile as we communicated at our April Analyst Conference. The credit capacity could be used to return value to our shareholders through funding of additional growth opportunities, increases and planned annual dividend growth, share repurchases or a combination. Before moving on, I'd like to give an update on where we're at in the regulatory process. We filed our Change-in-Control request with the PUC of Texas on October 5; and on October 12, the ALJ and the staff deemed the application sufficient. On October 16, the Commission approved the schedule of 180 days to resolve the case by early April. Now, we are responding to data requests. And we're optimistic that once we address questions and issues identified in the data request, we could work towards constructive settlements with the key intervening parties. Many of you have asked about our financing. And while we can't answer specific questions, I will say that as we execute our financing plan, we will consider our progress on the regulatory front. We will also consider a wide range of financing alternatives, so we can make the best decisions based on market conditions at the time of our capital raises. Please turn to the next slide. Sempra has a strong presence in the Gulf Coast, with our LNG projects, natural gas storage and IEnova. The addition of Oncor would further strengthen our footprint and serve as a new growth platform to expand our opportunity set. We have a great history of leveraging our platforms and understanding of energy markets to find new opportunities. Examples include development of our current renewables business to meet state RPS standards; and planting the roots for IEnova, which started out with a cross-border pipeline in northern Baja and three small LDCs. Our strategic vision for the Texas/Gulf Coast region is to be a major player in these growing energy markets. We expect the addition of Oncor, coupled with our existing presence in the natural gas market, to position us well to be a leading player in the Gulf Coast and cross-border energy markets. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll review Oncor's opportunities in more detail. Oncor recently had its rate case approved, which authorized a new ROE and capital structure. And Oncor made the commitment to spend a minimum of $7.5 billion over five years. Their current capital plan forecast is for $8.4 billion and is designed to improve service and reduce cost to customers. Some of the things we like about this business are : Oncor is investing in only transmission and distribution projects, so there's no exposure to generation assets which we believe is the right profile for electric utilities going forward; they are making large investments while maintaining the lowest rates in Texas; and they are authorized to recover cost associated with additional projects that are in the customers' best interests through a tracker mechanism without additional approval between rate cases. We believe this is a prudent regulatory mechanism which allow for timely investments to enhance customer safety, operational efficiency, and grid integrity. Not many companies have visibility to both a minimum 5-year capital plan and an approved authorized return on that capital. Therefore, the addition of Oncor will provide Sempra even greater visibility to utility earnings growth over the next five years. In addition to the existing 5-year capital plan, Oncor management has identified additional areas of potential investment which would benefit customers, including: expansion of the transmission grid and increasing the capacity of existing transmission facilities to accommodate low growth and reduce congestion; expansion into new growth regions in the Dallas-Fort Worth area; expedited deployment at smart grid and other technologies; and hardening of critical infrastructure to mitigate storm and other damage and the cost of restoration. Please turn to the next slide. As we were contemplating this transaction, the market opportunities we saw led us to believe we can make both companies better in the future. As you can see on the slide, Texas is a leader in energy and holds the number one spot in many areas. By expanding our business portfolio in the region with the Oncor transaction, we believe we are well-positioned to source additional opportunities in the Gulf Coast and Mexican energy market through the strong relationships, market intelligence and experience we have in one of the fastest-growing markets in North America. Please turn to the next slide where I will discuss our California Utilities' recent rate case filings. I briefly mentioned some developments at our California Utilities earlier, and would like to take a minute to provide some additional details. With regard to the 2019 General Rate Case filings, we requested a 19% and 11% revenue requirement increase over estimated authorized 2018 levels for SoCalGas and SDG&E, respectively; 6% to 7% average annual attrition mechanisms through 2022, which would result in a four-year rate case cycle; and projected investments related to our risk assessment and mitigation filings, which should help ensure continued safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems and increase our rate base over time. We will work constructively to achieve a fair and timely decision to be implemented in 2019. Please turn to the next slide. I would like to discuss the impairment that we recorded this quarter related to the cost from the 2007 wildfires. In August, two ALJs issued a proposed decision denying SDG&E's request to recover cost previously incurred related to these wildfires. We vehemently disagree with the PD. While this is not a final decision, under applicable accounting guidance, we concluded that the wildfire regulatory asset should be impaired. However, based upon the evidence and law, we believe the Commission should rule in our favor. Since this proposed decision, we have had properly noticed ex parte in all party meetings with the CPUC to reiterate our position that the wildfires fall under the construct of inverse condemnation; and that as such, this cost should be fully recovered through insurance and rate. California courts have allowed plaintiffs to claim inverse condemnation against SDG&E for the 2007 wildfires. To date, courts have applied inverse condemnation to utilities, in part, on the notion that utilities can pass through the cost to ratepayers. To further support our position, FERC previously approved, in full, SDG&E's wildfire recovery, considering the inverse condemnation precedent. We will vigorously pursue available avenues to favorably resolve the issue with the CPUC. And if needed, we'll exhaust all available administrative and court appeals. Also, in light of the recent wildfires in Northern California, I want to highlight the proactive steps we've taken over the years to implement a comprehensive fire risk mitigation program to help protect our customers and stakeholders. I'll go through the few of many examples. We installed 13,000 new steel distribution and transmission poles with higher-strength conductors and increased line spacing beyond the CPUC's requirement. We developed the largest utility weather network in the nation, with 170 weather stations, each of which provides real-time weather data, delivering enhanced situational awareness to our utility operations and field personnel. We also provide this data to firefighting agencies. We contracted for supplemental firefighting resources, including one of the largest helitankers in the world; and like our weather data, we make this resource available to our region. And we developed and implemented an aggressive vegetation management program, where we have a database of 460,000 trees that are in close proximity of our line. We systematically assess, remove, and trim vegetation away from our lines and facilities to reduce fire risk. Now, please turn to the last slide. To recap, we've been working diligently to deliver on our value proposition. First, we expect to be at the upper end of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range; second, we're leveraging our growth drivers to execute additional projects at both our utility and infrastructure businesses to add to future earnings growth; and third, we're advancing the Oncor transaction by making substantial regulatory progress, and we're looking forward to adding this strategic growth platform to our business. With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and start to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Greg Gordon with Evercore. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : A couple of questions. I apologize if I'm a little fuzzy on it. Can you take us through the initial Los Ramones Norte investment, and what the economics were that you articulated on that project? And what should we expect the incremental economics to be on this additional $520 million investment? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. We have been a part owner of this project. As you know, we own 25% of it. And what we did is we acquired Pemex's 25% share, bringing our total investment up to 50% of the project. I'll have Joe talk a little bit more about Ramones Norte. And we're hoping to close this in the end of this year 2017. Joe, you want to... Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Greg. Hey, you might recall that when we \u2013 IEnova actually acquired our 50/50 Pemex's interest in our joint venture, we excluded this particular pipeline, because this pipeline was the one that was actually in construction at that time. And as the parties negotiated for the acquisition of Pemex's interest in the joint venture, they were hopeful of getting a price that recognized that the pipe was fully operational, and all the construction risk, and everything was behind them, but that wasn't the case. So, we actually pulled this piece of the operation out of that and continued the joint venture, while the pipeline was being built. And now that's fully operational, it's already in service and have much lower risk, we went back to them, and they were still interested in selling that interest. And so, we struck a deal with them, which is a really good value, but probably closer to the lower end of our normal expectations of high single digit, low double-digit unlevered returns, and that's simply because it has lower risk. It's completed, it's in service and operating, and it's a great pipeline and is one of the biggest pipelines taking gas to Mexico from the U.S. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Fantastic. Joe, while I have you, can you give us an update on what the \u2013 now that we've hopefully gotten through hurricane season, whether you are still comfortable with the productivity level you're seeing at the Cameron site? And when it is that we'll get another big sort of update from you on how you're doing on milestones? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Look, before Joe says anything, I just want to remind everyone that we believe, and we firmly believe, from everything that we see now that Cameron will be liquefying natural gas in all three trains come 2019. And they've made a lot of progress on construction, and things seem to be going well, and not too much impact, it appears, from the hurricane. Joe, why don't you add a little color? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Greg, you pointed it out, and we're not completely through the labeled hurricane season, but I think we've made it through. And unfortunately, for all of you in the Northeast, it seems like the weather is moving that way. But the good news is, and although we recognize that certainly a lot of people in the Gulf Coast and across Texas suffered as a result of the storm and we contributed money to the efforts there, the storm had relatively little impact on the actual Cameron LNG site. And as far as the schedule goes, Debbie just mentioned, that we have no change in the schedule. We did get a claim from the contractor around Hurricane Harvey. It was a named storm, so they're allowed to make a claim, but it was rather immaterial, less than a couple of weeks delay. So, that didn't really change the schedule and an immaterial amount of money related to it. They have told us they might have some additional claims, but we don't have information on that. But I think it's pretty well-recognized that there wasn't much damage. We're still on track. Things are going well. They were back on the site working hard within a couple of weeks of the storm. And so, that's where we stand. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Right. My last question may seem a little bit esoteric, but on the inverse condemnation case, first, is it on the docket? Is it on the calendar due for a vote at any point soon? And two, if this were to go against you, don't you think it would have tangible enough consequences to people's expectations of risk in California that you would want to reassess what you believe to be your true cost of capital in the next review? Because if they're not going to honor the law here, then the true cost of capital for a California utility in the normal course of business is, in my perspective, materially higher than what you settled on earlier this year. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, it's on the calendar for November 9, and it's been on the calendar three times, and then postponed. So, we don't know what's going to happen on November 9. Obviously, with the situation in Northern California and the Napa fires that this has to be a focus area of the Commission. And the laws in California have been pretty clearly determined by the courts to apply to the investor-owned utilities. And these laws rely on the fact that these utilities that provide services for the public interest and have facilities in the public domain would have the ability to recover cost, and that therefore, they have strict liability. And that it is something that we will put through the court system if the Commission does not rule in our favor. In terms of the cost of capital, I think that's speculative at this time as to how all of this comes out. We look at the risks that we can mitigate. And as I've said earlier in my remarks, we have really focused on a lot of mitigation efforts to reduce our fire risk in Southern California and our service territory. Our insurers have told us that we have the absolute best fire mitigation plan that they've seen in the industry. So, our focus is on doing what we can control, and that we're hopeful that the Commission decides like they did earlier when they granted us the funds for FEMA recovery, which was our cost of restoration from the fire, and that FERC granted us full recovery in this. And that it would seem a little odd not to have the same type of recovery with the law in California. But at this point, we'll wait and see what happens when the Commission decides. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Much appreciated. Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Good morning. Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Julien Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. So, I wanted to follow up first on the Oncor side. Obviously, you've talked about some of the process here. Can you give us a little bit of an update on settlement negotiations, I know, just to the extent which they continue to happen, and expectations on even getting to a timeline there, first and foremost? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Sure. I would first say that we've been in settlement discussions for a few weeks, and that our modification through our financing actually came from hearing from the parties as to what their principal concerns were. And when we heard those principal concerns, we decided to simplify the financing and make our regulatory filing consistent with the 65/35 equity to debt that we talked about. And that really came from a lot of our discussions with the parties. Since that time that there have been some discussions with parties, but they're in the discovery process right now. And they, of course, have to do their diligence. And then, we would expect as soon as that discovery is complete, which should be very shortly, that we would enter into full settlement negotiations with the key parties in the case. Speculating timing on when a settlement could be reached is difficult, of course. But I think, really, by addressing the financing concern, that addressed a lot of the issues that we had heard from the parties. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. All right. Excellent. I'll leave that one be. And then moving back to Cameron real quickly, can you elaborate a little bit just in terms of you reaffirming the timeline. Is it that the hurricanes this summer, did they ultimately just shift within the expected delivery time window, or is it sort of offset by productivity improvements at other points? And I just want to make sure we're sort of crystal clear about how \u2013 the reaffirmation for folks out there? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I mean, we told you when we gave you the schedule the last time, it was not just a schedule that we have looked at and had hired consultants to do assessment of the schedule. And we've gotten third-party input when we looked at what we told you on the last call relative to the schedule, that what we saw was no change from those expectations coming through the hurricane season. There were some small delays, but we would not have any major impact of the hurricane. Joe sits on the Management Committee and is very close to this, so I'm going to ask him to add anything he wants to that comment. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Julien. I think it's more like within the window. Yeah, they're making good progress at the site and they were there right after. And so, we just didn't lose that many days, and then the hurricane season kind of came to a bit of a halt at that point. So the weather has been good, and they've been working hard at the site and making a lot of progress. So I think it's a combination of those things, but I'd say we're probably kind of within the window. But still the good thing is, we're still going to report earnings of $300 million to $350 million in 2020. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. All right. Excellent. And then, lastly, just real quickly on... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : From Cam. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : From Cam. As Debbie said, from Cameron. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : From Cameron, yeah. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yes, of course. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : I just want to clarify. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Of course. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Exactly. Absolutely, absolutely. It wasn't lost on me. Just very quickly on the CapEx side, wanted to make sure I'm hearing you guys right about obviously a lot of success year-to-date on adding things to the bucket. Where do you stand about reevaluating the open season in Texas, and then just in general about accelerating CapEx focused on Texas, be it Oncor or elsewhere? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, at this point, the open season, we just got the results in and we're contacting the parties who have expressed interest. And we don't have anything to announce at this time, but that we have a lot going on in the Gulf Coast region. People forget sometimes that we have the joint venture with TransCanada to build the Marine Pipeline across the Gulf region to Mexico. That's under construction right now. We have some storage development opportunities tied to the LNG facility. We have the pipelines tied to the LNG facility. And then, we have the three trains at Cameron under construction in Louisiana, and then are looking at moving forward with Port Arthur. So we see a lot of opportunity, most of which has been on the gas side. And we think that Oncor also has, in talking to their leadership, opportunities. They've been a little capital-constrained, as you might imagine, and have opportunity to invest for the benefit of their customers in areas like technology and in release of congestion that will actually reduce cost to customers, improve service. And we've asked them to start looking at, if they were not in such a capital-constrained situation, what more would they be able to do in terms of investments over time. And I think that they're really excited about the opportunities to look at spending time focused on how they grow their business versus dealing with five years in a bankruptcy court. So I think there's some great opportunities, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much. Operator : And next, we'll go to Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Going back to the wildfires, I had two questions on that front. One was just kind of how you're perceiving, I guess, the exact legal definition of negligence there, and how that was interpreted in the proposed decision? And then, secondly, on that front, kind of knowing what you know today and, let's say, hypothetically the CPUC does come out and reject your request, would you have had the opportunity to act differently in the court process at all? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, I'm not sure if I fully understand your question, but I'll try to answer as I interpret it. That negligence is not the standard for inverse condemnation. I mean the court, in looking at the fire claims never considered whether there was negligence or gross negligence; they only considered whether our facilities were involved in the fires. And if that is shown to be the case that your facilities are involved in the fires, the standard in California is strict liability. And that standard of strict liability comes from the view that you can spread those costs across the ratepayers. And it was a law that was really started from municipalities, largely, so they have facilities in the public good. And then if something flooded, or there was an issue that they could recover those costs across all of the customers in the municipality. The courts in California did interpret it to apply to the investor-owned utilities as well. So you don't ever get into a negligence standard through the court system on this. And that's the concern that we have with what's the proposed decision. It doesn't rely on how the courts determine how inverse condemnation is applied. It sets a different standard that is not the standard that's used by the court to assess whether you have a liability. So, that's where we will be fighting that. And we do not believe that \u2013 clearly, FERC saw that, and FERC looked at the same set of facts and believed that we were a reasonable utility operator; the very same set of facts, and that we were a reasonable utility operator. And so, these ALJ proposed decision, and I will stress, these are not Commission decisions at this point. They are ALJ proposed decision, we just see as inconsistent with the law and inconsistent with how the other regulatory agencies looked at the same set of facts. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got you. But then, let's say, hypothetically, you could rewind the clock almost 10 years now and going into the original court processes, know that you would not ultimately get recovery from ratepayers, would that have changed your legal options at all, I guess, negligence or no negligence? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No, because that's not the standard. We would have had no option on that. The courts determined that the 2007 fires fell under inverse condemnation, that our facilities were involved, and the fact that our facilities \u2013 there's no negligence whatsoever that's a consideration on those cases. And if we had tried to fight that, that's not the standard that's applied with inverse condemnation. So, it wouldn't have changed anything. And that's the thing that why we will go back to the court system if it's not ruled in our favor. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay... Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : The other thing I'll mention to your point, this is Jeff Martin, is the most important thing is we were prudent operators back in 2007, just like we are today. So, it doesn't really change, as Debbie's really going to the fact that the law at that time relied on inverse condemnation, and that's the basis of why we think we should have recovery. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : And I would say FERC determined we were prudent operators in their decision. So, it's just \u2013 yeah. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. I know you guys have been pretty clear, I think, on your position here and what your options were, so thank you for that clarification. My follow-up is just on Oncor. Maybe not necessarily your financings, but in regards to the memo that came from one Commissioner last week on the process. Does that kind of fall outside your expectations as it relates to the ultimate outcome of the case or your options here? Does it surprise you maybe given your discussions with interveners up into this point at all? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No, not at all. I mean, this is the discovery process that occurs. And if you look at the other cases that have been before the Commission, that this Commissioner has asked similar kinds of question, it's part of their diligence. And I would expect the Commission and interveners to due diligence. In the next 10 days, we will be submitting supplemental testimony to address all these issues. We look forward to addressing those issues. We have nothing of concern and nothing to hide that we have great financial strength as a business, and we look forward of explaining all of that, explaining the kinds of contracts we have on LNG, where we have really mitigated the risk in our types of contracts. So, that we will submit our responses to the PUC of Texas, and we would expect them to consider all of that as part of the fact base in the case. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, understood. Thank you, Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator. And next, we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Couple of easy questions for you. One on Southern California Gas. And there's something I'm not entirely sure I understand. Maybe I'm misstating how much growth is there. At the Analyst Day back in the spring, you all highlighted that you thought \u2013 I think it was in Steve Davis' slides that Southern California Gas' rate base could get to about, I don't know, around $7.6 billion in 2021. And yet in today's slide deck, you're showing it at $9.7 billion in 2022. That's a pretty big change, right? I'm looking at slide 13 from today. And I want to make sure I'm following that just because I know you've announced a bunch of projects, but I didn't realize looking at that chart on page 13, you announced something that could take SoCalGas' rate base all the way up close to $10 billion. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Let me take you back to the Analyst Conference and explain or remind you how we did the forecasting for the utilities at the Analyst Conference. And what we told you at that time, when we looked at the out-years of the plan, and 2021 is the one that you're providing, all we did is we took the approved rate base that we had, and then we applied the attrition factor that had been approved for the utility over the life of the plan, so that's all we did. And that it did not reflect our regulatory filings; it did not reflect this new process, this risk adjustment mechanism, the ramps that we had to look at risk, and then how do we mitigate those over time with a systematic replacement of key components of the system. And so, what you're seeing now is what we filed for in the rate case, that would be our 2022 with the amount of rate base we requested and the attrition mechanisms we requested in the rate case. That is not to say that we're going to get all of that, but that is what we've requested. And in that rate case now, we have specific projects and specific activities to consume that capital. When we did it before, all we used is what had been approved with an attrition factor on it. So, this gives you greater visibility to what we're looking at in terms of CapEx requirement for the utility. Again, it's our filing, we may not recover all of that, but we think we have great justification for it, because that all came out of the process that the Commission has asked us to use which is this risk-adjustment process. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. So, in other words, what you're saying today is that your expectation, both for capital spends and rate base growth at Southern California Gas is significantly higher than what you outlined back at the Analyst Day in the spring? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. It's higher for both utilities; it's about $1 billion higher. The 2022 number is about $1 billion higher than the 2021 number we gave you. And for SDG&E at about $2 billion higher for SoCalGas, which came out of our rate case filing, and going through detailing from this risk process that we were required to use, what are the expenditures that we need for our business, and then what is the normal replacement cycle for replacement capital. So, that's what we have in our regulatory filings. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And then one Texas question or an Oncor question. The Oncor rate case, already been resolved, the new rates go into effect soon, are there any post-deal infusions you have to make into Oncor? I know they're getting a higher equity layer, or is that all just kind of factored in as part of the transaction? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah, the Oncor Board of Directors will determine how the \u2013 they changed their equity and the rate case; they thickened their equity. And the Oncor Board of Directors will determine how that equity gets put into the business. So, it was approved in the rate case. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: But it's not incremental equity above the purchase price that Sempra has to put in. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Jeff, why don't you describe how that... Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Michael. The purchase price we've agreed to is $9.45 billion. As you've talked about, subsequent to our original purchase request, they have finalized the rate case and that they need to move the equity layer up from roughly 40% equity to 42.5% equity. As you know, along the way, it depends on when our closing occurs and what time post-closing we actually have to fill up the rest of that equity infusion. But if there are additional equity requirements for Sempra, it's been fully factored into all of our financial analysis. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. So it's factored into all of the $0.10 to $0.20 accretion dilution, all that... Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Yes. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ...kind of stuff that you put out in the public domain. Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Yes, it is. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes, it is. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Can you hear me? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Good morning. Yes, we can hear you. Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. Okay. So just with the wildfire, just sort of a follow-up, I think, on the earlier question. Just to make this crystal clear, this has nothing to do with negligence, nothing associated with the ALJ's ruling, et cetera, correct? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : The inverse condemnation law in the state has no negligence requirement, and that's the law that governs who has accountability for the claims under inverse condemnation. The ALJ had indicated that there are things that they thought that we should have done differently in hindsight review, looking at things, but that there's no court that has come out with any finding of negligence in this case. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And I guess the question that comes up, of course, is that since we've had wildfires in other parts of the state, if there was to be found, hypothetically speaking, negligence associated with the utility, would a finding in your favor have any ramifications with respect to a situation in which negligence was the reason associated with liability, if you follow me? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I don't know how I can explain. Negligence is irrelevant. That if you have a fire that your facilities were involved in, the law of the State of California, if it shows that your facilities were involved in that fire, you have strict liability. You don't go to court. No one claims negligence in court. They claim inverse condemnation. And if it's shown that your facilities were involved, there's a strict liability standard. All the claims that we paid out on our fire had to do with strict liability and inverse condemnation. And that law is created because you were supposed to be able to collect from your customers, or if you're a municipality, those in the municipality. So negligence is not an issue. No one claims in these cases negligence. They come in and they claim its inverse condemnation, and that you have strict liability for it. So all the claim \u2013 I'm sorry? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So I appreciate that, and I thank you for the clarification. I'm just wondering though, in terms of the issue of recovery from ratepayers \u2013 I guess, I should have articulated this more clearly \u2013 in terms of recovery from ratepayers, would the issue of negligence be an issue that might come up? Do you follow what I'm saying? Because it sounds like you guys are saying that there were some things in the ALJ where they said that you might have done some things better, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But I guess what I'm wondering is, and I guess the reason why the question is being asked I think to a certain degree because of the recent wildfires is, if it was found that a utility had been negligent in terms of how it was \u2013 I'm not suggesting you guys were involved in that, I'm just suggesting \u2013 I'm just questioning, if that was the case, would that have any impact, in your opinion, on the ability to recover from ratepayers? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : It should not. It should have no basis. If you just look at why you buy insurance, and we get rates funded to buy insurance. Insurance, it doesn't matter, you pay out a claim, an insurance claim, and it doesn't matter whether there's negligence or not in an insurance claim. Insurance is to protect you. And this law basically is like a replacement of insurance. And so, it should have no basis. It should have no basis. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. I appreciate that. The second question I'd like to ask you is with respect to Oncor. And just, in general, I mean are you guys willing to keep the ring-fencing in other provisions long-term? Should we think about that as sort of long-term setup, or how should we think of those? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, when we look at Oncor and the ring-fencing and we look at the independent Board of Directors, at some point it would be nice for us to have built the confidence of the regulators in the State of Texas by how we act as an owner, that they would see that we should be treated like any other utility in the State of Texas. And other utilities don't have that kind of structure. But I think it's something that we have to earn over time, with the way that we capitalize that business and ensure that we honor the provisions and that they see that Oncor management really makes the decisions for the best interest of Texas and its customers. And I hope we are able to earn that confidence from the regulators over time. When we look at the ring-fence and those provisions, we felt it was not significantly different than what we have or how we've operated with our California Utilities under a first priority condition, where we have to put capital into those utilities to meet their needs. And so, is it livable? Yes. Would we want to change it over time with us proving that we were strong owners and the Commission feeling that we should have the same kind of regulatory structure that the other Texas utilities do. When we get to that point, we would look at maybe a way to transition. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. And then, sorry, just back to the wildfire and the write-off charge. What I'm a little bit unclear about is, you just got an ALJ recommendation, and just based on that, it seems that you guys are taking the write-off, even though we don't have a final decision. And I'm just wondering, I guess, there must have been some sort of threshold question about whether or not you thought it was likely or not. And I just wonder if you could address specifically what led to the write-off and hypothetically, if you did get a ruling in your favor, we just see that reverse, is that correct or is there anything else we should think about? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Let me just comment that the standard is very high; it's an 80% probability standard. And what we looked at is all of the facts. We looked at \u2013 that we had an ALJ proposed decision; we don't have an alternate decision at this point; and that we have to meet this 80% probability standard. And under the accounting rules, we felt that the interpretation of the accounting rules would cause us to feel, at this point, that we would have to take this impairment. If the Commission rules in our favor, then obviously, that whatever the ruling would grant us, then that would come back. And I would stress that is a non-cash impairment, but it was our interpretation of the accounting rules is applied to all of the information that we had. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Faisel Khan with Citi. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Faisel. Faisel? Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. I'm here. Sorry, guys. Can you hear me? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Debbie. I just had one follow-up question. Actually not a follow-up question, a separate question. Just in terms of the Aliso Canyon investigation, is there any update on the timing of the study that's being done by Blade? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No. They're in the process right now of removing the casing on site, but there's been no indication of when they're going to complete their work. So, as soon as we hear anything, of course, we would report that. But at this point, they're just in the process of removing the casing from the well. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So, they're still on site, I guess... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: ...doing more of the physical work. They're not even ready to put a report together, it sounds like. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : No. They're not at all ready to put a report together. They haven't even completed the casing removal, so. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Great.

Mihalik - Sempra Energy Analysts : Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners Operator : Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir. Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's fourth quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With me in San Diego are several members of our management team. Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and CEO; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 27, 2018, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Rick. On today's call, we will review our 2017 results and key accomplishments, both of which highlight an exceptional operational and financial year, and provide a strong foundation for future growth. We believe 2018 will be a transformational year for Sempra with the expected closing of the Oncor transaction, further progression of Cameron and execution of a robust capital plan. 2018 also marks our 20th anniversary. Since our formation, we've continued to strengthen our business with strategic investments that have provided for more than a 600% increase in shareholder value. Later, I'll share some of our key goals for 2018 that should help us continue our strong performance well into the future. In 2017, we exceeded our adjusted earnings guidance. This morning, we reported full year 2017 earnings of $1.01 per share or $5.42 per share on an adjusted basis, well above the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range, which was $5.30. Also last week, our board approved another 9% increase to our annual common dividend, bringing it to $3.58 per share. This marks the eighth consecutive year we have raised our common dividend and represents over 40% growth since 2013. It also exemplifies our strong commitment to our common dividend, an integral component of our value proposition. I'm also pleased to say that we are affirming our 2018 EPS guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share, which now includes both the anticipated near-term effects of tax reform and the expected positive impact of Oncor. Jeff will review the key drivers of our 2018 guidance a little later on. Please turn to the next slide. 2017 was an exceptional year for Sempra. I want to take a moment to highlight some of the key accomplishments and how we've carried this momentum forward into 2018. First, our full year adjusted earnings increased approximately 8%. The main driver of this outperformance was higher operational earnings across our businesses. Our success stems from our focus on execution, managing our business efficiently, and our ability to find new growth opportunities across our businesses as demonstrated by the approximately $1.9 billion we've added to our already robust capital plan since last year's analyst conference. Second, we announced the Oncor transaction in August and constructed a plan to achieve approximately 80% ownership of this exceptional company. Once closed, this transaction will enhance our business mix and provide increased and more geographically diversified utility earnings. On that note, we're working to close this transaction expeditiously, and have reached a settlement agreement with all 10 stakeholders. The Public Utility Commission of Texas has requested that a proposed order to approve the transaction be drafted and put before them for a vote as soon as March 8. We have also completed the necessary financing and expect the transaction to close soon after Commission approval. Please turn to the next slide. Third, our confidence at Cameron is bolstered by another year's worth of construction progress and a constructive settlement agreement that we entered into with Cameron's EPC contractor in December of last year. The agreement resolved all known and unknown claims through the agreement date, falls within the project budget, estimated contingencies with financing commitment, and aligns the interests of all parties to focus on the goal of having all three trains producing LNG in 2019. Fourth, at our California Utilities, we recently reached a revised settlement agreement regarding SONGS that maintains the outcomes of the original agreement for Sempra's shareholders. If approved by the CPUC, our customers will have added benefits compared to the originally settled case. We also continue to make progress regarding Aliso. As I said on our call this time last year, we've been focused on resolving the remaining Aliso-related issues as expeditiously and safely as possible, including resolving legal claims. This year, we've made a substantial progress, including resuming reinjection to support reliability and collecting substantial insurance proceeds. In addition, we recorded a $20 million expense based upon progress related to a potential litigation settlement with certain parties. As you can see, we performed well financially and operationally, and resolved many key business issues, thereby, mitigating certain risks. We also identified new growth opportunities and made significant progress on the Oncor transaction. Please turn to the next slide. I'll now discuss a few of the important items we'll be focused on in 2018. Regarding Oncor, we expect the final decision as soon as March 8. With respect to Cameron, all parties remain focused on Cameron producing LNG from all three trains in 2019. We've included a photo illustrating Cameron's progress in the appendix for your reference. At our California Utilities, we're moving ahead with the 2019 General Rate Case filings in a timely manner and a substantial amount of the investing we requested, in this case, would be used to further enhance the safety and reliability of our systems. Moving on to California's wildfire situation. We have developed and are executing on a three-pronged strategy, which includes filings on the regulatory front, requesting legislative actions to improve fire safety and provide greater clarity at the California Legislature and continuing operational fire risk mitigation. So far, we have filed a request for rehearing of the CPUC decision and SDG&E's 2007 wildfire preceding. A terribly flawed decision that has created much of the confusion and uncertainty that exists today. If the CPUC decides not to rehear the decision, we will proceed expeditiously in the courts. I think it's important to know that FERC approved full recovery for the same fires and same facts over four years ago. Legislatively, we are joining a broad coalition of interests focused on helping the state fix the multi-faceted problems associated with the devastating fires that are impacting the state's environment and economy. More specifically, the situation demand solution. Specifically, three areas that needs to be fix are, the inconsistency between inverse condemnation and the CPUC disallowing cost recovery; the availability and affordability of fire insurance for utilities, businesses and homeowners; and the establishment of objective and measurable criteria on prudency. Operationally, we continue our decade-long efforts to reduce fire risk within our SDG&E service territory. We believe our efforts to fire-harden our electrical system, to improve situational awareness by utilizing new advanced technologies such as the deployment of 170 weather monitoring stations, and a high tech camera network in fire-prone areas, and to develop strong partnerships and operating protocols with fire agencies, have and will continue to improve the safety of our communities. Lastly, as we do on a regular basis, we are reviewing opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, to support growth and maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings. Specifically, we're looking at asset sales, having ongoing discussions with the credit rating agencies, initiating our repatriation plan, utilizing the strong and growing cash flows across our businesses, and finally considering aftermarket (11:12) offerings. We will provide additional details regarding asset monetization repatriation and other plans to continue to build our balance sheet at our analyst conference on June 28. Please turn to the next slide, where Jeff will review our 2018 guidance. Jeff? Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. What we're excited about is having the opportunity to build on our success in 2017 and early 2018. Today, we're affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. Two key updates have impacted our business since we last discussed guidance. First, on our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call, we projected the overall impact from tax reform in the 2021 timeframe to be generally neutral. Now that tax reform legislation is passed, we're pleased to confirm that our long-term assessment remains neutral to slightly positive. We will, however, encounter near-term pressure in 2018, but expect that to be offset as Cameron comes online. Second, with the progress we made on the Oncor transaction, we're now including it in our guidance. Oncor accretion is expected to be roughly $0.20 per share for 2018. Please turn to the next slide. Next, let me provide an overview of how we think about tax reform. I believe we can all agree that a strong economy benefits all businesses. And since we're strong believers in the need to invest in U.S. infrastructure, tax reform is a clear benefit from that perspective. So over the next few years, you should expect to see us adapt our strategy to take advantage of this new environment. Next, in terms of our domestic utilities, lower federal corporate income tax rates will benefit customers. This should provide headroom for CapEx spending and allow for an easier path to improve safety, reliability and technology, all of which are priorities for us. Second, the new territorial tax system increases the value of our international businesses by allowing greater flexibility to optimize our global capital structure and through repatriation of excess offshore cash back to the United States. Also when it comes online, Cameron should realize $65 million to $75 million of increased annual earnings due to the lower tax rate. Next, let's look back at the impacts of tax reform in 2017. We recorded a non-cash earnings charge of $870 million. About $182 million resulted from the re-measurement of deferred taxes. Approximately $328 million related to the deemed repatriation tax. And roughly $360 million related to the accrual of U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes associated with our planned repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. To be clear, the last two items are very important. This now allows us to repatriate approximately $4 billion with minimal, if any, expected foreign, federal, or state tax expense. To take advantage of this benefit, we plan to immediately begin repatriating in 2018 and expect to bring back approximately $1.6 billion over the next five years, with the remaining $2.4 billion returning thereafter as the businesses generate additional cash at the local level. Please turn to the next slide. Going forward, we expect that tax reform will have a neutral earnings impact in 2020 and become slightly positive longer term. Next, let me address our domestic utilities. We expect the overall impact to our utilities to be generally neutral, and our customers will benefit from the lower tax rate. As previously mentioned, there is an opportunity for increased infrastructure spending while maintaining customer bills. This opportunity to increase CapEx is not included in our current assumptions. Second, the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate has the most significant near-term impact. This is a result of the lower tax shield on our corporate cost, which is primarily interest. However, this negative impact is offset as Cameron comes online and as we reduce parent debt levels. Next, in terms of undistributed foreign earnings, we expect no material incremental tax expense related to the $4 billion we plan to repatriate. We continue to view our international businesses having strong growth opportunities, and we're also pleased that tax reform provides improved flexibility to bring cash back to the United States. Regarding interest expense deductibility, we currently assume no limitation. This is based upon our current understanding the application of the law, but could change in the future as additional guidance and regulations are made available. Like many other utility holding companies that are currently not paying cash taxes, we expect to receive lower tax-sharing payments from our utilities. Although the credit rating agencies have viewed this as a negative for the entire industry, we're actually in a unique position to be able to mitigate much of this impact through our new repatriation program. In summary, here's what's most important about tax reform. First, our businesses that operate at a loss are negatively impacted with the largest impact being felt in 2018. By 2020, we expect tax reform to be neutral as our Cameron LNG facility comes online and increasingly positive over time. In terms of repatriation, this is a real positive because we now have improved flexibility to bring back $4 billion with minimal or no expected tax expense, and we'll be updating our work with the credit rating agencies this spring with the intent of providing a clear view of how we plan to strengthen our balance sheet over time at our June analyst conference. Please turn to the next slide where I'll discuss our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter losses of $501 million or $1.99 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $389 million or a $1.54 per share. Full year 2017 earnings were $256 million or $1.01 per share. This compares to 2016 earnings of $1.370 billion or $5.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2017 earnings were $5.42 per share. This compares favorably to our 2016 adjusted earnings of $5.05 per share. Next, please turn to the next slide. The 8% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings was driven primarily by higher operational earnings in 2017, including $44 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, and AFUDC equity at SDG&E $24 million of lower losses at Sempra LNG & Midstream; $16 million of higher earnings from PSEP and AMI at SoCalGas; and $8 million of higher operational earnings in South America. Please turn to the last slide where I'll hand it back to Debbie. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Jeff. 2017 was another successful year for Sempra. We were able to exceed our 2017 adjusted earnings guidance, while positioning ourselves to make 2018 a transformational year. We also affirmed 2018 EPS guidance and increased our annual common dividend by 9%. All of this can be attributed to execution of our operational plan and leveraging our growth drivers to add significant incremental investments. We look forward to carrying this momentum through 2018 and beyond. Before closing, I'd like to recognize Steve Davis, whose retirement we announced back in September; and Rick Vaccari, who will also be retiring in March. Together, they have contributed over 50 years of experience at the company. On behalf of the team at Sempra, we wish them both great happiness in retirement. And with that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop, to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi, Julien. How are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Rick and Steve. I just wanted to step in real quickly and ask you, first, on the California backdrop. Can you elaborate a little bit more on your thoughts in terms of where this would go from a legislative perspective, first, with respect to any specific governance (20:40) efforts, and then also with respect to any kind of omnibus legislative efforts? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I think the timing of your question is great, Julien, because yesterday, Assemblyman Holden had the Utilities Committee come together, and President Picker from the PUC testified before, as did the Head of the PUC staff. And the two things that really came out of that meeting yesterday that I think are significant that we're starting to see as real changes are an urgency to resolve the issues of inverse condemnation and a recognition that there are several factors that impact the cause, the scope, and the spread of fires, and it is irrational to place all of that burden strictly on the utilities. And that was kind of the tone of the meeting yesterday, which I think is a real positive in terms of the focus on what needs to be done to correct that. One of the things they did yesterday is that the Commission's staff presented some of the best practices, and they relied heavily on the practices that SDG&E has put in place since the 2007 fires, with the use of technology and the actions to look at proactive deenergization when there are risk issues and all. So, I think two things are happening. I think that there is a focus now on having to resolve this inverse condemnation issue legislatively. At the conclusion of the hearing, they asked that the PUC attorneys work with the attorneys for the Assembly, and look at if they're interpreting the legal issues the same. So, I think there's going to be some movement in that area. And then further, I think this focus on what the utilities can control is the best practices and having the focus be on do the things that you can control, and then the state needs to have a more \u2013 a broader look at what can be done to reduce the fire risk, to improve our firefighting efforts, and a whole variety of issues that needs to have a comprehensive solution. But I thought the hearing yesterday was a real positive sign of more attention and urgency. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. And then just following up on the guidance for 2018, I think I heard you right at $0.20 of accretion for Oncor. Can you elaborate a little bit more? I know this may be a little early days on how you're thinking about that. And then separately and probably related, what's the pace of capital spending you all are thinking about of late? I know this may be a bit preemptive, but obviously there's a few different moving things happening in Texas of late. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. If you look at Oncor, the $0.20 that we used for this year was to kind of give you a sense of how we offset some of the tax reform implications, and we detailed that in our slides. And Oncor helps us meet a portion of those impacts for this year from tax reform. But the great operations that we've had from our businesses, and you saw the results in 2017, and that was really all of our businesses just performed exceptionally well. So, we see that continuing on until 2018. And I'm going to turn it to Jeff to talk about any more of the details around the Oncor and how we're looking at CapEx going forward. But we basically share with you, for Oncor, about $8.4 billion is part of their plan over five years. But they're looking at things that they can do in their business that may lead to, over time, some increases in that, especially in terms of some technology. Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Hey, Julien. Good morning. As you think back to our analyst conference last spring, you recall that we rolled out a $14.2 billion on balance sheet capital program. We had probably (24:43) another $1.8 billion off balance sheet. As Debbie indicated, that excluded the new $8.4 billion of capital spending, of which obviously 80% of that would be accounted for us related to Oncor. So I think that gives you some sense of going forward. You're probably looking at something close to $3 billion per year with about $2.4 billion of that is a run rate for our utilities. But obviously, we will update that with a little bit more clarity in June. In terms of the accretion around Oncor, we're obviously moving away from the metric we've used in the past, which was kind of provide a four-year average. But as part of our 2018 guidance, we thought it was appropriate that we could give you our expectation, obviously the closing date is uncertain. There's a few things moving around, but we've approximated the accretion at $0.20 this year. It could be a little bit more or a little bit less, but keep in mind that that also is for a partial year. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. The other thing, Julien, I would add to what Jeff said is that after our analyst conference last year, we already identified $1.9 billion of incremental CapEx spend. And that's detailed on slide 17 in your packet. And as you know, when we do our plans, we do it a little bit differently than others. We only put projects in those plans that we already have under contract or that are consistent with our regulated business approvals. So, since the analyst conference, we've identified more upside opportunity in terms of the $1.9 billion. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But let me just specify this, if I may, the $0.20 of accretion you're talking about for this year and, obviously, it's a partial year, does that reflect the change implicitly higher versus the four-year average you previously articulated of $0.10 to $0.20, like on a go-forward basis, obviously lots of moving pieces? Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I appreciate your question. I think the four-year average was what we felt comfortable doing in the fall, because we have lots of moving pieces, Julien, right? You've got issues about when you sell your forwards at what price that the preferred actually transacts at in 2021, the date of closing, so there's a series of things involved here. On a going forward basis, now that we're putting Oncor in our guidance for 2018, that $0.20 number could be slightly larger or less than that. But there really isn't any fundamental change in terms of how Sempra is thinking about it, to the heart of your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Excellent. Thank you. Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks, first off, I also wanted to... Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Good morning. I definitely wanted to give a hearty congratulations to Rick and Steve, both. I've been doing this an awful long time and they make me look like I'm a newcomer and they've certainly always been kind of happy (27:33) professionals. So congratulations, guys. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : That is quite a compliment. Yeah. That's quite a compliment. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I know that, Jeff, that you tried to wave us off a little bit here on page 10 when you say that you might need additional equity, but you want to cover that at the Analyst Day. Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Right. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So let me ask the question a little differently. How much does your FFO to debt metric come down, all things equal, given the $240 million per year less of tax sharing? And what are other things that may be impacting your FFO to debt metric? And what is the target that you're seeking to achieve in 2019 or 2020? And then what are the levers you can pull that would cause you to not need equity to make that number? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Okay. Let me start and then I'll turn it over to Jeff, because I think the thing that you have to realize with us is different than other utilities is we have Cameron coming online in 2019 and a full year of operation in 2020. And the earnings from Cameron now with tax reform go up by $65 million to $75 million above the $300 million to $350 million we told you. So, one of the things that we're trying to do is work with the rating agencies to look at the significant event that occurs. And tax reform created one event, but that event is really reversed a lot when Cameron comes online in terms of our FFO to debt. And we started working with the credit rating agencies very extensively as we were dealing with the Oncor (29:29) transaction and kind of looking at how our portfolio changes over time, how the cash flows change over time and how our FFO to debt changes over time. And when Cameron comes on, there's significant improvement in our FFO to debt. Further, last year, when we did our plan for FFO to debt, we far exceeded the plan that we had and the cash flows from our ongoing operations were exceptional. So, one of the things that we're trying to do, and the credit rating agencies have been willing to work with us, is trying to look at this whole pattern over time that we have for our business and look at the way to maintain our credit ratings over that period of time. And part of that is looking at capital rotation. It's been the repatriation. It's looking at better cash flows from our existing businesses, which we achieved last year and all of those things coming together. And until we put all of those things together in a comprehensive way, I will tell you that's the sequence. And then to us, that's the sequence, and then you look at equity at the end of that. And so, that's the process we're going through right now. And I just want you to understand that that is the process and we'll be ready to go through that with you at the analyst meeting, because we're going through that right now with our board. So Jeff, do you want to add? Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I think that, Greg, there were multiple parts to your question and between Debbie's response and mine, please let us know if this kind of satisfies most of what you're asking about. But to Debbie's point, we did extensive work with the rating agencies last fall. We have some more work to do this spring. But I think you recall that as we looked at the Oncor transaction, we had really forecasted to being able to hold investment-grade-plus ratings at both S&P and Fitch, with the likelihood that we would probably be investment grade flat at Moody's. I don't think our assessment has changed since then. Also as part of that work, we really were targeting to maintain those ratings and they were going to allow us some time to get to the optimal debt to equity ratio for the transaction. And you'll recall, we talked about that being completed by December of 2019. So to Debbie's point, relative to Oncor, not tax reform, we really had kind of a runway to work through the debt to equity ratio and how we balance that for Oncor through December of 2019. Now, as we finished 2017, Debbie's spot on, we really had very, very strong years on FFO to debt last year, one of our best years ever. We were well within the investment-grade-plus thresholds for all three agencies. But the point that you're on is that by reducing the tax-sharing payments, it is a negative for us. But to Debbie's point, that really doesn't start showing up until 2019, Greg, based upon how we're balanced in California and what our expectations are. And when you get to 2019, that's when you're starting to see the three trains of LNG go into production. So, I think there's a little bit of a timing mismatch in 2019. But we've got a plan that we're going to execute on with the agencies this spring. Debbie laid it out, the process we're going to go through. I'm quite comfortable that by the time we get to the analyst conference, we can provide a lot more detail about our expectations. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's directionally clear. I appreciate it and look forward to more details later. Thank you. Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Greg. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Great. Thanks, Greg. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hey. First, congrats, Rick and Steve. Best of luck. And so, on the one technicality on the Oncor data and tax reform. How are you treating the debt issued for Oncor? Is that in your tax reform impact or that's just in the Oncor benefit? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Jeff. Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : We think about that \u2013 I would just go through this with you really quickly, Steve. But as the starting point, you recall that interest in our utilities is largely excluded. The rest is subject to the 30% EBITDA limit. We certainly expect \u2013 I think this is part of what you're hearing in the call \u2013 to lower our parent debt over time. And as part of that process, we'll be allocating parent interest to our subsidiaries with a view that anything that's left over can be carried forward kind of given the strength of future cash flows from Cameron. But to your specific point, our view of the guidance thus far on acquisition debt is like Oncor, like we're talking about for Oncor, is expected to be excluded similar to the utilities. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Then on the repatriation of $4 billion, can that be done without asset sales or is that \u2013 embed some amount of asset sales in there? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : What we've looked at, as we said, for this year, about $500 million to come back of cash that we have offshore, know our (34:21) asset sales are part of that $500 million and then about $1.6 billion over the five-year plan period, which includes that $500 million and that doesn't include any asset sales. But the headroom up to $4 billion that we have prepared for would allow us down the line to sell assets or businesses. And to the extent that we had already covered the tax on that $4 billion, then they would not be taxed again. But in terms of our plan that we laid out, we don't have any asset sales currently in that, and that's the work that we're going to be looking at. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just lastly, any updated color on the LNG market in terms of potential growth? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, as you can see in the media, it's turned quite positive and there's a lot of interest in the 2022-2023 period. I'll have Joe talk about each of our projects and kind of the interest in the buyers. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. Yeah, as you see as Debbie noted in the market and there was a nice comment from Shell yesterday, the market is getting tighter as the excess volumes are being taken up with improving demand. And also, we're seeing quite an uptick in oil prices, again making U.S. LNG very attractive, and the continuation of a current and future Henry Hub gas price continuing to fall. So, I think the bottom line here for us is, we have three projects that are in good shape, they're in permitting, and they're in marketing, and we feel really good about those. And let me just kind of remind you of what we have and what we're doing, because I think we're a company that actually has multiple projects and all of them we're excited about. So, I'm going to go in alphabetical order. So, read into it that we're staging them in some way. This is alphabetical. So at Cameron, I think that the expansion of Trains 4 and 5 are fully permitted at FERC and DOE. And so, it's a very valuable option for us and our partners, because it's a low-cost build. And our focus today is getting Trains 1 through 3 in service and completed. And now, the probable entry of Total is very positive for expansion, and you've heard their CEO come out and make it public that they are supportive of expanding the facility. And I've had a number of conversations with them on this topic. And so, we're anxious to keep that process moving. I think they hope to get it done by the middle of the year and they just have to work through all the consents. At ECA, the one that's just 40, 50 miles south of here, we have a proposed large-scale facility for 12 million tons. It received all of the major permits in Mexico in December. We today \u2013 because of market demand and a number of very interested parties who we received letters from expressing their interests and continuing conversations happening even yesterday and today in Asia, there's a lot of interest in us building a mid-scale facility sooner. And so we're looking at a 2.5 million ton facility that would fit on to the ECA site and would not preclude the larger facility from a footprint point of view. What we're doing now is evaluating a couple of things. One is, are we confident that we have the pipeline access without building any new pipelines to feed that mid-scale facility and are we absolutely confident that if we build the mid-scale facility we won't have problems making sure we have sufficient permitting to do the large scale and that would require of course a large pipeline back to the Permian. So that's ECA, we're very excited about ECA. And as well at Port Arthur, we have a very excellent location there. We've been working with Woodside now for a couple of years and we've created a really excellent project facility from a technical and gas supply perspective. It's going to be highly reliable and safe and economical, which is what the customers want. We think the LNG unit costs are going to be lower than at Cameron due to the optimization work we've done with Woodside. And again, we think that the market is good. We have the Heads of Agreement we signed with KOGAS last year and we're continuing to work with them and many other participants. And the marketing teams, as I said, are out in Asia and Europe all the time. So, I think it would be great if we're able to launch at least one of these projects, at least one of them, with HOA this year, followed probably by FID next year. And that puts the production into that window, that ideal window 2023-2024 as the supply/demand curve opens up. So, we're looking good and feeling good about it. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Couple of just nuts and bolty type questions. Just curious, California rate base, you all talked briefly on today's call about how tax reform could lead to incremental investment opportunities without it negatively impacting customer rates. Can you give a little bit more disclosure on what are the opportunity set areas you're thinking about? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, as you know, we just filed our rate case, Michael, and it was the first rate case that we've had at our utilities that uses the Risk Assessment mechanism, RAMP, as it's called, to identify and prioritize spending in our utilities. None of that is in our plan. As you know, when we do our financial plan, we take what our last rate case is. We look at the attrition levels that have been authorized, and that's how we plan going forward. So I think as we look at it, we had a pretty robust rate case request that was driven by this Risk Assessment mechanism. We think with the tax benefits that flow through customers, that will create a reduction in rates that hopefully will allow (40:30) the Commission to approve the kind of request that we have in our rate case. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And when I look at the rate case docs, one of the things that hasn't happened yet is when you filed the case, bonus depreciation was still expected for the next couple of years. Obviously, with tax reform, that's gotten pulled out. Just curious, like if I just took your rate case request, how material is that to like your multiyear rate base views? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. What I have is just the impact in 2018 and 2019, because we had assumed bonus depreciation was going to be going away over the timeframe phasing out (41:05). So in 2018, it gives us about an extra $100 million of rate base, and then in 2019 about $200 million of rate base. But as I said, when we do our planning, we don't put any of the future years in the planning. We just use what we have authorized with the attrition. And when we do our five-year plans, we carry that out on that basis, and we do not put in the incremental request that we made. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And I have one \u2013 and this maybe a Jeff question, one around Oncor, because you made the comments about no longer kind of anchoring to the $0.10 to $0.20 four-year average accretion. In your year-one accretion, you've kind of pegged at $0.20 or so, plus or minus a little bit. Just curious, are you seeing the potential to where Oncor \u2013 either due to synergies, due to growth projects, due to kind of the limited lag, due to the DCRF and TCOS, are you seeing where Oncor could even be more \u2013 significantly more accretive than when you first entered the transaction? Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Michael, I appreciate the question. I mean, obviously, we've entered into our merger agreement back on August 21 and there were probably \u2013 I'm making the number up \u2013 30 different variables that impacted how we thought about the business economically. And as you went through the last six months, obviously, our stock price changed. But at the same time, they finished their rate case, right. So, you added a lot more certainty for them to finish their rate case in November. Their overall capital program has gone up. Our assessment of their NOL position had increased. We had forecasted last summer some contingent liabilities. That amount has declined over time. So there has been some puts and takes over the last six months, but I don't think we think about the business fundamentally any different. We think, from a strategic standpoint, it gives us reach and scale into what we think is probably the most important energy market in the country. I think that the accretion numbers we've given you for 2018 is really reflective of how we felt about the transaction previously. So, it's not like we're looking at it fundamentally different. We're just kind of zeroing in now with less variables. You still have things out there, Michael, about what price does you preferred convert at, when do you unwind some of your equity forwards and at time it is, and what the timing of closing is. But we feel pretty comfortable about the transaction generally from an accretion standpoint. But probably more than anything else, we're excited about it means in terms of giving us a really nice growth platform in the Gulf. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And if you don't mind, one more. What's your target, either FFO to debt or debt to EBITDA? Like, where do you want to be, even if it's a couple of years post-Cameron or like what's your long-term aspiration? Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I think the way that I would speak to that is I think we're very comfortable that we want to be an investment-grade-plus company. We indicated earlier on the call that we were well within those thresholds for all three agencies earlier in the year. I think if you look back at our Q4 results, we've got a debt ratio of roughly 56%. We've got about $19 million (44:23) of total consolidated debt. And across our five-year planning period, we feel more comfortable at or below 50% from a debt ratio standpoint. And I think that we'll continue to work on our FFO to debt. The challenge you have with that question, Michael, is the overall business risk profile is also changing. So, that comes lower as you add a quality asset, like Oncor. And similarly, the quality of the cash flows from Cameron impacts that. So, conceptually, the overall business risk profile should be declining at the same time that you're working through these competing items of lower cash tax-sharing payments with the addition of Cameron coming online here in the next 18 months. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Debbie. And Rick, Steve, congratulations, guys. Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Michael. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Michael. Operator : And our next question is from Shar Pourreza, please go ahead, with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Hey, guys. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Hi. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : So just sort of thinking about, again, just incremental accretion opportunities for Oncor and, again, not to preempt things. But with deal closure sort of around the corner, what are your thoughts on looking at acquiring the TTI piece? And also, a little bit more curious, as you manage this business over the next few months or years, do you see sort of an opportunity to request a removal of the ring-fencing provisions in time, and maybe look at recapitalizing, especially in light of the structures your peers are afforded in and out of the space (45:51)? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yes. Let me just address the TTI portion first. And, as we have expressed multiple times, we think TTI's interests are very much aligned with our interests. So, we are happy to have them as a 20% owner. But should they decide that they wanted to exit, we definitely would want to have an opportunity to consider the purchase of their share. And so that we think we are fine with the 80% ownership and TTI as a partner. We've met with them on a couple of occasions. They have the same kinds of interests about growing that business. There's no disconnect between ourselves and them in terms of how they look at that business. Of course, over time, it would be great if they decided that they wanted to exit, that we would have an opportunity to step in and own 100% of what we think is a preeminent company. In terms of the growth opportunities on Oncor and the ring-fence, we have accepted those terms with the parties. And what we think we need to do is we need to show those parties over time, through our exceptional management of this company in conjunction with the Oncor management, that those kinds of protections are not going to be needed over time and that we can live with all of them. We spent a lot of time looking at them. We don't think that they're going to impact materially how we do our business with Oncor. However, none of the other utilities in Texas have them. And we don't like the idea of having something that other parties in the state wouldn't have on the long term. But I don't think that as we look at those elements, I don't think it will change at all how these businesses perform. And the management of Oncor, the board of Oncor, we all have great alignment in terms of how this business needs to grow. And we see great growth potential in the Texas market and in Oncor itself. So, we are very happy that we're getting close to closing this transaction. We think it will be a tremendous investment for Sempra shareholders over time. And if nothing changes, we can live with it. But over time, if we can make some changes to the structure, we're more than willing to do that. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : That's helpful. And then just as you guys think of projects like ECA, can you sort of give us any thoughts on what you're seeing in Mexico and sort of these potential reforms and the impact to IEnova assuming like AMLO wins. It's clearly kind of been a bare argument around the story. So, what are you sort of seeing with boots on the ground there? Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Yeah. In fact, I'm going to have Joe talk about that, because he was in Mexico just a few days ago and there was a lot of discussion about Mexican elections, about NAFTA and about our investments there. And I will just say we feel pretty darn comfortable with where we are and what Mexico needs going forward, and not thinking that there's going to be a lot of change. But Joe can add some more color from being there. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Sure. Yeah. I think the overall theme is, our business strategy there, in Mexico, at IEnova, are with Mexico's efforts to reduce the cost of electricity and fuel to all of its consumers. And we believe that those efforts will continue and not change, regardless of which candidate is elected to be the next President of Mexico. And I think it's too early to tell who will win that. But we feel really good about the business. I'll come back to ECA in a second. And we're doing what we can to help the consumers in Mexico. And the one thing to remind yourself is that it requires two-thirds vote in the Houses and 51% of the states to overturn the energy reform. That's a high hurdle. But remember, the most important thing for you to take away from this is almost everything we've done in Mexico didn't require energy reform. We were doing the pipelines. We had the regas terminal. We had our utility businesses. Almost everything we've done down there didn't require energy reform and wouldn't be upset by that. So, it's something we don't want to see happen, we don't think will happen, and we're very involved. I've been quite involved with Dennis Arriola in our Washington office and people in Mexico on NAFTA and reminding all of the secretaries in each of the three countries how important it is. We'll see where it goes. But go back to ECA for a minute. Look, you might remember that PEMEX has been, for the last couple of years, our partner in trying to help develop the ECA site, and now we have a new agreement with them where they're not going to participate anymore. But going forward, IEnova and my LNG team, we're working together on trying to turn that into a liquefaction facility. However, remember, until 2028, we have great contracts for the regas terminal, and we want to keep those in place. They provide substantial EBITDA and earnings for us. We think there's a good opportunity here. And as I said, we just got the permits in December for the large-scale facility, and we do not see any problem with those despite whatever the election results are. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Got it. And then just maybe one question for Jeff. On the asset sales, the $1.6 billion, can you just maybe help narrow down what the asset and maybe the geographic footprint, or is it sort of \u2013 with sort of the tax reform advantage of repatriating, should we think about more of those asset sales will come from foreign investments? Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you. I think the key part of your question is that both \u2013 how we think about repatriation and capital rotation. These things will go together this spring in terms of the analysis we're going to do. But I think this is a process on capital rotation, you'll recall that we do periodically. If you think back to 2016, we decided to divest Rockies Express and Mobile Gas. We went through a very similar process then, and our strategy really, as Debbie has articulated in the past, is we look at asset by asset whether it's meeting our return expectations, number one. And number two, does it fit into our portfolio as we continue to try to high-grade our investments around things where we have a lot of transparency to really visible growth. So, I think that's the process we'll follow. It's something we've done before. And I think between now and the analyst conference, we'll be able to optimize both, both the repatriation piece as well as capital rotation. Trevor, you want to anything? Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Yeah. I just want to say that the $1.6 billion that we have that we talked about really is not part of an asset sale. That's just the repatriation of cash that's offshore right now, and the ongoing earnings coming from those businesses. So, that $1.6 billion is not earmarked asset sale. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Terrific, guys. Thanks so much. Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Debbie Reed, at this time, I would turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy : Well, thanks again for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team. Rick is still working today, so if you want to give him a call, I'm sure he'd be happy to answer some of the questions on his final day. And thank you for joining us. Bye-bye. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded. Now, at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Faisel Khan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Faisel Khan : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy\u2019s first quarter 2018 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team including Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer, Trevor Mihalik, Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Arriola, Chief Strategy Officer and Executive Vice President of External Affairs and South America; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor. Before starting, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company\u2019s most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we\u2019ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and the Table A in our first quarter 2018 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I\u2019d also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 7, 2018, and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Jeff Martin. Jeff Martin : Thanks, Faisel and welcome to the team. As much as we enjoyed filling your questions in the past, it\u2019s nice to have you on this side of the call today. I\u2019ll start by thanking Debbie Reed and acknowledging the pivotal role she\u2019s played in Sempra\u2019s growth and success. This Company clearly would not be in a position it\u2019s in today without her leadership and vision. Our succession plan was designed to ensure continuity of leadership, and the recent executive appointments demonstrate our commitment to continue our focus on delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders. I\u2019d also like to welcome everyone into their new roles as well as the Oncor team and to thank Allen Nye for joining us today. We were just in Dallas a few weeks ago meeting with our top 200 leaders and could not be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Oncor\u2019s strong, pure play electric T&D business solidifies our footprint in the Gulf region and just as importantly, improves the scale and diversity of our domestic utility earnings. With these changes, I\u2019d like to reiterate that Sempra\u2019s value proposition still holds true. Our team remains focused on pursuing strong growth with the utility like risk profile. We remain committed to maximizing shareholder returns through strategic, disciplined investments, and growing dividends. Lastly, we\u2019re reaffirming our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. In doing so, it\u2019s also important to point out that we\u2019re tracking two non-cash items that could impact this guidance range later in the year. Trevor will cover those later in the call. Please turn to the next slide. As we highlighted on the fourth quarter call, we have four near-term priorities. First delivering on our growth strategy; second, executing on our California regulatory goals; third, ensuring that all three trains at Cameron produce LNG in 2019; and fourth, continuing to analyze opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet to support future growth, which we\u2019ll address in greater detail at our upcoming analyst conference. Let me start first with growth. We have improved visibility into our long-term growth strategy with the closing of Oncor, almost one month earlier than planned. Oncor\u2019s a substantial addition to our business mix and creates a significant platform for us. We\u2019re expecting our portion of Oncor earnings for the partial year of 2018 to be in the range of $320 million to $360 million. Also, you\u2019ll recall that to support that transaction, we executed on a $9.6 billion financing plan. The $5 billion of debt that we raised was approximately five times oversubscribed and the $4.6 billion of equity and equity linked offerings were well over three times oversubscribed. Additionally, it\u2019s worth noting that over 80% of our equity offerings were allocated to existing shareholders. Second, we\u2019re moving forward with our California regulatory priorities. In April, our California utilities submitted updated rate case testimony that includes projected impacts from tax reform. We\u2019re pleased to say that this will benefit our customers through lower projected builds at SoCalGas and through increased wildfire mitigation investments at SDG&E with no expected impacts to bills. Additionally, ORA recently submitted their testimony which keeps the process moving forward. We expect TURN and other interveners\u2019 testimony will be submitted shortly. We\u2019re focused on advancing these rate cases as they will help our California utilities continue to provide safe and reliable energy to the communities they serve. With regard to protections for wildfire risk, we along with other stakeholders continue to execute a three-part strategy to help protect our customers, and just as importantly, help ensure the long-term health of our California utilities. In fact, we\u2019ve seen good progress over the last several months. First, together with others, we\u2019ve helped lead an education campaign with the Governor\u2019s Office, Legislature and Public Utilities Commission. In mid March, the Governor\u2019s Office legislative leaders issued a statement recognizing the need to sign a comprehensive solution to the increased threat from natural disasters and climate change, which includes updating liability rules and regulations around inverse condemnation, recognizing the need to build and operate infrastructure to increase resiliency, examine availability of insurance in areas at risk from wildfires, and needing to modernize utility practice and procedures around fire prevention. Second, there have been positive developments on the legislative front with several bills being introduced. Two notable concepts were introduced in these bills. The first of which was the need to adopt standards across the state to reduce wildfire risk; and second, the need to establish objective and measurable criteria that can form a part of a new prudent manager standard for utilities going forward. While the current text of the bills don\u2019t specifically address inverse condemnation, we and other stakeholders are also looking to separately address this issue in Sacramento. Third, we are making great progress with Cameron trains one through three. To be clear, this is one of our top priorities. We continue to expect all three trains to be producing LNG in 2019. Recall, at the end of last year, we reached a settlement agreement with our contractor to resolve all claims. This was important because it better aligned the parties\u2019 interest with the goal of having all three trains producing LNG in 2019. We continue to believe this agreement puts both the contractor and Sempra in a stronger position to meet the current schedule. We are also pleased with the recent shareholder approval to combine McDermott and CB&I, which we believe improves our contractor\u2019s overall delivery capabilities and financial strength. And finally, on the growth front, IEnova recently announced award of $130 million liquid fuels project with two strong multinational counterparties. The project has 15-year U.S. dollar denominated contracts for 100% of its capacity. It also capitalizes on the continued build-out of infrastructure related to Mexico\u2019s energy reform by increasing fuel supply capacity in Mexico. In turn, this further helps Mexico\u2019s energy mix become more reliable and gives consumers more fuel choices. Please turn to the next slide where Trevor will walk us through the quarterly results. Trevor? Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $347 million or $1.33 per share. This compares to first quarter 2017 earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $372 million or $1.43 per share. This compares to first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $438 million or 1.74 per share. Let\u2019s turn to the next slide where I\u2019ll discuss the key drivers impacting the quarterly results. I\u2019d like to start off by highlighting our operational performance, which included $22 million of higher earnings at SoCalGas, primarily due to the effect of a lower income tax rate in 2018 on the higher margin of the first quarter, $15 million of equity earnings from our investment in Oncor, beginning March 9th and $8 million of higher pipeline earnings, primarily attributable to assets placed in service in the second quarter of \u201817 in Mexico. Our adjusted quarter results were also impacted by the following, $94 million of higher losses at parent, which include higher net interest expense and preferred dividends and $23 million of lower earnings due to the recognition of AFUDC in the first quarter of \u201817 at Mexico. This was partially offset by $14 million of higher earnings due to the application of revised seasonality in 2018 at SDG&E. I would note however that this does not impact their full-year results. Now, let me talk about two non-cash items that we are tracking that could impact our full-year adjusted earnings guidance, which Jeff briefly mentioned. First, we you\u2019ll recall that our primary foreign exchange-related exposures in Mexico are related to the taxes on our U.S. dollar denominated debt and deferred tax balances. Consistent with prior years, we continue to hedge the monitory positions so our upside and downsides are limited with respect to large currency movements. Related to this, we\u2019ve updated our 2018 FX rules of thumb. You can find these rules of thumb in the appendix. Importantly, we\u2019re closely monitoring the currency movements but it\u2019s still fairly early in the year. Second, we\u2019re continuing to evaluate tax reform and its impact. While the territorial tax system increased the value of our international businesses, we believe the component of it, the global intangible low tax income is impacting us as an unintended consequence of tax reform. A law was intended to prevent transfers of intangible assets to low tax jurisdictions, which clearly is not our case. This quarter, the tax was an $8 million expense with an estimated full-year impact of approximately $24 million. It could also reduce our earnings in future years by similar amounts but declining over time. We\u2019re hopeful that this issue will be fixed with updated regulations or legislation before the end of the year. But until this happens, we\u2019re recording the tax as part of our earnings. Now, please turn to the next slide while I hand it back over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks, Trevor. We\u2019re excited to be hosting our analyst conference next month in New York where we\u2019ll be providing important updates regarding our future business plans. We\u2019ll review our overall strategy and vision, updates on each business segment and our overall capital and financing plan including how we expect to recycle capital. We\u2019ve spoken to many of you and consistent with the feedback we\u2019ve received, will be updating our approach to guidance by laying out our earnings expectations for the next three years. In doing so, our goal of this year\u2019s conference is to provide a detailed view of how we plan to create shareholder value well into the future. We hope you will be able to join us in New York. The date of our conference is June 28. And with that, we\u2019ll conclude our prepared comments and stop, to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will hear first from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Go ahead, please. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning. Congratulations. So, a couple of quick questions here. Can you elaborate a little bit further on the pace of sensitivity and just how you think about your set of hedges to the extent at which that they might not necessarily be linear with the previous disclosures? And how to think about the sensitivity impact you\u2019ve just announced just to get that out of the way for \u201818 but more importantly beyond? Jeff Martin : You\u2019ll recall that we tend to focus on two different baskets, Julien, when we talk about FX as we\u2019ve got the deferred tax assets and into the future we also kind of hedge as we\u2019ve talked about in the past our current monetary liabilities. So, for the quarter, we had FX and inflation impacts of roughly negative $30 million. The two key takeaways I\u2019d give you is you got to remember that IEnova and all those projects are U.S. dollar denominated. So, that impacts how we account for those cash flows. And you can see this in table F. If you look at table F, it gives you a better sense of underlying economics of the IEnova. And the second point to reiterate is it\u2019s a non-cash impact. So, what we do is each year we use some form of costless collar, and that reflects how we hedge our current monetary liabilities. And then, as you think about future years, so the second part of your question, that gets reset every year. So, as you go into next year, those hedges roll off and we hedge the forward year. So, from a guidance standpoint, we don\u2019t think about the future any differently because of results in Q1. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Perhaps just a follow up on that. Obviously, over the last few days, we got some developments in SoCal around some gas pipeline effort. Can you talk about some of the mitigating factors there on that specific project more broadly? And also just maybe, to hit the gas demand question for SoCal, obviously we\u2019ve seen a number of developments throughout thermal projects more broadly. How do you think about gas demand and more importantly gas infrastructure demand in light of the latest pipeline developments with PD? Jeff Martin : I think you are referring to our pipeline safety and reliability project. And for some context, Julien, this is part of the overall PSEP program that the Commission kicked off back in 2011 where they asked all of the natural gas transmission operators to ensure that these are either pressure tested or replaced pipelines. Typically, these are pipes that are old or vintage that had not been previously tested. And the pipelining question is referred to as we refer to as line 1600. This is one of two lines bring gas north to south into San Diego. It is either old or vintage. And what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve filed for that project really under the PSEP program with a view toward replacing the larger diameter pipe. And in this proposed decision, what it appears is they\u2019re focused on that we -- they prefer that we either pressure test it or rescission portions of it, replace portions of that pipe. I think at this point in the process, it\u2019s relatively early. But our goal is just to make sure we work with Commission and staff and stakeholders really around one view, which is to make sure the pipe is safe. So, that\u2019s kind of our approach going forward. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll read into it in terms of how we think about gas demand going in the future. We have got over 90% of the state\u2019s heating and cooking that\u2019s done with natural gas. So, this is more about a safety issue, making sure that we are being responsive to the 2011 order from the Commission. Operator : And now, we will take a question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : Just to confirm what you said earlier that these impacts -- these currency impacts are noncash. So, the ongoing impact on the underlying economic value of the business is really not material, [multiple speakers] right? Jeff Martin : That\u2019s correct. Greg Gordon : And then, what form might we -- in order to look forward, so we understand the implications of the potential for clarification on this tax issue? Is that something that the treasury could fix through issuing a rulemaking? Does there have to be a formal legislative patch? Could it be one or the other? Can you explain to us what the paths for clarification on that issue are? Jeff Martin : I\u2019ll touch and then I\u2019ll pass to Trevor to provide additional clarification. But, this is one of these things that inadvertently came up as part of the overall tax reform package. And the way the calculation works is it picks up companies like ours that actually own controlling interests in foreign jurisdictions. And so, we\u2019re planning on working with treasury to get some technical corrections. But Trevor, you might want to provide additional color for Greg. Trevor Mihalik : So, yes, we are looking at trying to see if treasury would be willing to work with the companies to get a technical correction on this. Right now treasury is working through it. But if you take it as the black letter of the law, treasury is saying the way the law reads it\u2019s inadvertently and they acknowledge that it\u2019s inadvertently picking up companies. So, we\u2019re looking at a path either through a technical correction or through some kind of legislative fix on this. Greg Gordon : Thank you. Joe, if you don\u2019t mind, could you give us an update on how things are going vis-\u00e0-vis productivity at the Cameron site? There has been some concern that A, at a high level, the unsolicited bid for McDermott could cause some inadvertent risk to your revised transaction, to the revised structure of the deal. And then two, away from your project that CBI recently announced the delay in another project which caused people to then move back and start worrying about Cameron. So, can you give some -- to the extent you can give us some of comfort or color around those things that would be helpful. Joe Householder : Yes. I was just at the site two weeks ago. And I was there and we had our Cameron LNG board meeting at the site. And we toured the site and I can tell you, it was pretty impressive. There was substantial progress their compared with the last time that I had visited with the other board members from Japan and from France. And we had a very good meeting. We took a long tour. The substantial work going, CB&I and Chiyoda still maintain that they are on the path to get us LNG from all three trains in 2019. It\u2019s looking very good. I was very impressed with the productivity I saw with the number of people there with what they were doing. So that was all going well. As to your question about the CBI McDermott merger, yes that was two weeks ago a little bit of a scare, but both companies voted to approve the merger. So that\u2019s moving ahead and supposed to close on the 10th. So, we expect that is moving ahead. Certainly, when we saw the Subsea offer to McDermott, we all started looking at that and what would it do. But frankly things are going well at the site. So, we were prepared to deal with that, should it have gone that direction. But, I\u2019m happy to say that it\u2019s moving down on the right path. Greg Gordon : And then, the Freeport delay, is there any reason for us to make a read through there as to the ability of your -- the JV to complete the project on the current schedule? Joe Householder : Thanks. Look, I\u2019m not going to talk about the Freeport project, but I don\u2019t think there is any read through there. They reported that I can say through the scope, but that wasn\u2019t little bit surprising. A lot of it I think had to do with the floods that they had in Houston which has more impact on them than it had on us. Operator : And now, we will hear from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : The recent movement in Permian gas differentials and recent competitor pipeline announcement push out the time line to develop P2K, or is everything moving unchanged? Jeff Martin : Thanks for that question, Ryan. And congratulations on your promotion. That\u2019s an important project for us. We are monitoring that situation. At this point, we don\u2019t have an update on P2K other than what we\u2019ve said publicly in the past. Ryan Levine : And then, could you frame the incremental investment opportunity regarding SDG&E\u2019s wildfire, potential wildfire mitigation program? Jeff Martin : One of the interesting things about that program is we\u2019ve started back in 2007, I think our experience back then has really informed our approach hardening the system, improving our standard operating procedures around wildfire and climate change risk, including I think just probably over half decade ago, actually starting an active program of deenergizing the circuits on a case-by-case basis when we are in extreme weather, and we thought that safety was in doubt. And in terms of the capital programs, the biggest one we have going forward right now is obviously the Cleveland National Forest program that\u2019s between $600 million and $700 million capital project. And what it\u2019s doing Ryan is it\u2019s upgrading over 80% of our 69 kV and above circuits in the backcountry, most of which are in the most dangerous wind condition areas. And moving that from wood to steel poles and they are using wider conductors or spreads, but they will be continuing to assess ways to take and deploy capital, make the system more safe. Ryan Levine : And then, last question for me, what\u2019s the current outlook for ICA\u2019s midscale projects and what size trains are currently being contemplated? Jeff Martin : One of the things we are looking forward to doing at the analyst conference is providing full update on each of our development projects. Obviously, over the last three to four years, we have been relatively bullish on that 2023 to 2025 window. So, that\u2019s something we are looking forward to providing updates on. But, Joe, do you want to give a quick update on kind of how you think about the size and the midscale versus the full scale project down in Baja? Joe Householder : We have the project, as I mentioned before, fully permitted for the large scale facility at this point in time. And we are getting a lot of interest, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the midscale facility that could be done more quickly and get to market sooner. So, we are talking to potential customers on that but also continuing to talk to customers about the large-scale. And we will see through this year how we think about which way to go there, and the site and accommodate both. But, we currently are permitted for the large one we are seeking potentially to have a carve-out of some of that permit for the midscale. So, we could move forward with that more quickly. And that\u2019s what we choose to do. But there is a lot of customer interest for getting the LNG earlier in the cycle and that\u2019s what we are focused on today. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : I\u2019m looking at slide -- and could you remind me the rate base -- the weighted average rate base on an apples-to-apples comparison, so excluding FERC assets for San Diego Gas and Electric? What that was in 2017, the California rate base for 2017 for SDG&E and SoCalGas? Jeff Martin : We will track that down for you on the call. I\u2019ll give you one feedback is in the revised GRC filing, which we noted, just in terms of eliminating the bonus depreciation for 2019 adds $400 million of rate base in 2019 going forward. And I\u2019ll pass the comparison to Trevor and you can give that feedback to him, Trevor. Trevor Mihalik : Sure. Good morning, Michael. The rate base for SDG&E at the end of the year for CPUC was about 5.4 billion and for SoCal it was about 5.9 billion. And roughly that\u2019s pretty close to where it is today. They\u2019re roughly equal. Michael Lapides : Got it. And could you just remind us, that\u2019s a pretty big growth rate year-over-year of I think about ending 2017 versus weighted average 2019. If I think about that as a compound growth rate, that\u2019s a pretty big uptick and then I assume it\u2019s kind of pretty similar as you filed going out into \u201820 and \u201821. What are the biggest drivers of that? Jeff Martin : I think if you think back over our analyst conference, year-over-year we\u2019ve always been messaging, Michael, around kind of a five year capital deployment at both utilities of around 12 billion and that backs into roughly 1.2 billion a year per utility. And that will vary depending upon the year and the cycle. But most of SDG&E\u2019s investments have come around modernizing its distribution transmission grid. A lot of this has to do with improvement to substations, line extensions, adding to new growth. And some of the capital programs we\u2019ve put in place at the time and honestly, even utility like I referenced to Cleveland National Forest project is a big driver currently. The two SDG&E I\u2019d refer to would be a Cleveland National Forest project and the SOCR project, which is the Southern Orange County Reliability project which was an important upgrade for us. And then at SoCalGas, most of this has been driven by their tip and dip programs as well as some of their PSEP work. Michael Lapides : Got it. And how -- in the ORA testimony, it seems there\u2019s multiple things that one could take as a positive. Just curious, how are you looking at the potential for your even settling a rate case? I know, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen a California utility actually settle one. But, you never say never. Jeff Martin : Well I would start with saying, it\u2019s early in the process and it\u2019s probably too early to read too much into the ORA filing. Two things, I thought that we were somewhat optimistic about which was their recognition of the need, Michael, for a four-year rate case cycle. I think, probably over time, this is probably the path I think California is heading towards. And secondly, they also picked up our request to have two way balancing for wildfire insurance. But to the larger issue is, this is obviously an important rate case for us. It\u2019s one that we\u2019re following closely. You\u2019ll remember being premised around the ramp filing. So, this is really important that we\u2019re kind of trading hierarchy of capital requests regarding what we think is most important from a safety standpoint. And I\u2019ll pass it to Joe to provide some more color. Joe Householder : Thanks, Jeff. I just wanted to go to your question about settlement. Our history has been that we seek to find common ground with the other parties and believe settlements are efficient and effective for everybody. So, we\u2019d continue to certainly work with the parties towards that end. We think that the other interveners are filing testimony next week. And so, expect for our last cycle when the Commission just wasn\u2019t in a position to move forward on that, we\u2019ve always worked to settle our cases. Michael Lapides : Got it. One last one, guys, I apologize for monopolizing some of the time. What significant capital investment opportunities that either of the two utilities -- and that aren\u2019t necessarily approved yet today are outside of the TRC filing, meaning might be done in separate side dockets at the CPUC or might be FERC related assets? Jeff Martin : Look, I think probably the best place for us to address that is probably at the analyst conference. But, one of them we talked about it earlier was the PSRP project which is a Pipeline Safety and Reliability Project that\u2019s between 600 million and 700 million. That\u2019s the one that we got a PD on where they recommended a different solution. Also, when it came up in the ORA filing is issue of OMEC. You may recall there was kind of the put call feature with Calpine relating to the their Otay Mesa. That\u2019s something that could come into our plan depending upon the outcome of that. But, you are right, there will be filings outside of the rate case. Cleveland National Forest was an example. But, in terms of forward-looking projects, those are ones we\u2019ll try to address for you later in June. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jeff. Much appreciated, guys. Joe Householder : Just one point of clarification with regards to the GRC, we have received ORA, we just haven\u2019t received TURN. We expect to receive TURN later this month. Operator : Now, we will move to a question from Paul Patterson Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Just to circle back on the tax thing. Do you guys have intangibles overseas? And is there transfer pricing or transactions occurring or is it just -- could you just elaborate a little more? Jeff Martin : Yes, Pau. This is the global intangible tax. We don\u2019t really have any intangibles overseas. This thing was designed to target folks that were moving intangible earnings from one jurisdiction to a lower tax jurisdiction. We are not involved in anything like that. We just got controlling interest in foreign companies. And this has inadvertently picked us up. And by the way, it\u2019s hitting other industries beside the utility industry. And that\u2019s why we just want to make sure we get the technical correction as soon as we can. Joe Householder : Hey, Paul. This is Joe. The other interesting thing is now with tax reform, the U.S. has the lowest tax rate of the countries we are in, so it will make no sense for us to transferring it. But, Jeff is right. I mean, we have intangible technology, but we are not transferring it from one company or one country to another. Paul Patterson : And then, just on the -- it sounds like, if I heard you correctly, the inverse condemnation issue, you plan to have separate legislation in Sacramento. Is that correct? And just if you could elaborate a little bit more on the timing or how you thought that might show up? Jeff Martin : Paul, we\u2019ve got kind of this three-tiered approach, so obviously we are going to exhaust our regulatory remedies of the commission related to our WEMA, [ph] request for rehearing. We are also working with stakeholders up and down the states to try to find a legislative solution. I think you saw in our prepared remarks, there\u2019s been several different bills have come forward, some of which are constructive and some of which are less constructive. But in terms of whether we expect legislation this year and next year, our goal to work with all the parties and states to see if we can get something done this year that remains our goal. Paul Patterson : And do you think inverse condemnation be part of these bills or do you think it will be separate bills? I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m little bit confused by the statement. Jeff Martin : The bills have come forward today have not fully addressed inverse condemnation. So, we are hoping to have a bill that comprehensively addresses that. But, I think what\u2019s interesting is, the dialogue across the state now is really starting to recognize that this is not an industrial and utility issue. This is the state of California issue. This has to do with residential owners and whether they can procure insurance. It impacts municipal utilities and impacts insurance companies, the trade unions are involved. So, this is a large issue across the state. And I think what we\u2019re looking for is a bill that comprehensively addresses all the impacts from land use management to liability rules impacting utilities. Operator : Next, we will hear from Lasan Johong Auvila Research Consulting. Lasan Johong : Couple of things. First of all, you had a month and a half to look under the kimono at Oncor. Any surprises, good or bad, or any changes, CapEx changing at Oncor? Jeff Martin : We\u2019re pleased to have Allen Nye, their CEO join us today on the call, Lasan. And as I indicated above, I attended my first Board meeting there with Debbie who is also on the Board with me. We\u2019ve gone out there and met with their top 200 leadership group. I think, one of the things that\u2019s most exciting is from a cultural standpoint in terms of how they lead that Company, their priorities, their commitment to using capital to lower the cost of Texas consumers is very much in line with how we do business. So, I think just from a starting point, the culture and the fit is going very, very well. And I thought, I might just past it to Allen to talk about anything that he\u2019s seen on the horizon. He is excited about in terms of his capital plan and some of their priorities. Allen Nye : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. And I couldn\u2019t agree more, after all we\u2019ve been through, we\u2019re thrilled to be here. We agree with you, it couldn\u2019t have gone any better so far. So, thanks for that. With regards to capital, we already have a robust $8.4 billion capital plan over the next five years. We\u2019re in a state that\u2019s growing. There is good growth in our state. We are seeing residential premise growth at 2% and consumption growth around 1.5%, consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the last few years. So, there is good growth. We\u2019re going through the planning process with our Board and we\u2019ll look at a capital plan again in October. That\u2019s kind of where we are right now and again we\u2019re really glad to be here. Lasan Johong : Jeff, until Oncor acquisition, most people looked at Sempra as gassy company. Obviously acquisition of Oncor has just dramatically changed the make-up of Sempra. Going forward, do you care whether it\u2019s an -- Sempra is more electric or more gas or do you want to maintain an even 50-50 kind of split or does it matter at all to Sempra and its shareholders? Jeff Martin : Lasan, it\u2019s a great question. And given your coverage over the last 10 years, you\u2019ll recall in the middle part of last decade, we had a very large commodity business. We had a an IPP fleet in the west that was close to 3,000 megawatts. I think what you\u2019ve seen us do really is pivot over the last five to seven years to be more of an infrastructure company. So, we\u2019ve moved away from all of our combined cycle plants. I think we\u2019ve got one last plant down in Mexicali that we got held for sale. We obviously disposed off our commodity business. And look, we certainly think the whole theme of electrification is a hard trend. We think that natural gas has an important role to play in terms of supporting move toward cleaner energy. But, there is no question that our company is focused on businesses just like Oncor where we can participate more in the infrastructure side of our business and then from a procurement and generation of electricity. Lasan Johong : So, you don\u2019t care whether that\u2019s from gas or from electric? Jeff Martin : No, we don\u2019t care necessarily. But I certainly think we have growing interest in a lot of the very positive trends that are taking place around batteries, renewable energy, electrification, transmission and distribution, particularly Lasan, in growing markets like Texas which is a core opportunity for us. Lasan Johong : Last question for Joe, I guess. You talked about the need for more demand to be filled out in Asia. Does that mean that Sempra is likely to try and do a midscale LNG facility first and then build a larger second phase or would you be doing at -- would you be looking at two smaller midscale opportunities back to back? Joe Householder : Thanks for that question because it is an emphasis. LNG is definitely a part of our strategy and so gas is important to us. And with respect to ICA, we haven\u2019t made a firm decision yet about how we are going and we are going to use the market to tell us a little bit about what direction to go here. There is tremendous interest in that facility because the buyers do not have to take LNG through the Panama Canal. And so they really would like to see if it\u2019s already built there. And I think the market is going to tell us the right answer. I think we would not be likely at all to build two midscale facilities. If we go to large scale facility we will do that and we could still build a midscale on top of that. If we build the midscale first, we can still go with the large one. There wouldn\u2019t be a circumstance probably where we would do two midscale facilities. They are going be in two different locations on the site. Operator : And next Ashar Khan with Visium. Go ahead please. Ashar Khan : Jeff, can I just ask, so I don\u2019t get this wrong because there is a lot of confusion. So, as you correctly pointed out that the currency translation is a noneconomic number for 2018. And as you said in your presentation that you will be providing us with forecast for 2018 and \u201819 and \u201820 at the analyst day. So, will that noneconomic number or the number that you\u2019re showing for this year, the sensitivities, will those sensitivities also have an impact for 2020, because the currency has moved against us, the Mexican currency, since December 31 of last year or is that only in reference to the year 2018 and hence it has no impact when you share with us your updated 2019 and \u201820 numbers? Jeff Martin : Ashar, let me start with saying thank you for joining the call, and I appreciate the question. The impacts we are talking about are confined to 2018. So, it won\u2019t have any impact. We will update our numbers at the analyst conference and any changes to our rule of thumb. But I\u2019d also mention to you that over a longer period of time, the peso has been weakening against the dollar. So, you go back to the time that we did our IPO of IEnova several years ago, the peso was at a much lower exchange rate. And even since the end of Q1, the dollar strengthened pretty strongly against the peso. So, you\u2019re going to see these types of moves quarter to quarter. But in terms of for in guidance now this confined to 2018. There obviously will be ongoing impacts to the deferred tax assets but primarily what we are focused on is the current monetary liabilities, and that\u2019s a 2018 issue. Operator : And now, we will hear from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Just curious upon the asset rationalization and rest of the financing plan. First of all, have you had any discussion with the rating agencies subsequent to closing and how did that go and kind of maybe give us a sense of what you are targeting? And secondly, I guess, you could have just done this all with equity. So, if you pursue whether options to complete the financing, it would be better than having done just more equity? Jeff Martin : Maybe I will give you a little bit of context. But, if you go back, one thing you may want to reference is we have this conversation on slide 14, there is a little bit of the recap of our financing. I think to start with kind of the key takeaway\u2019s we raise $9.6 billion in January. We had innumerous meetings with the rating agencies last fall and as part of that they\u2019ve asked us to kind of target a equity ratio of 65% and that we would fill that out over 18 months or so, which is really the second half of 2019. And if you apply that 65% target ratio against the 9.6 billion, it meant that we were looking to raise roughly $6.24 billion of equity. And you\u2019ll recall we\u2019ve got about $4.6 billion that we\u2019ve addressed so far. So, we\u2019ve got another $1.64 billion of equity. And I use that number notionally. I\u2019m just harkening back to those rating agency conversations. And to your point, yes, we\u2019ve met with the rating agencies this year in New York around both of those issues including how the agencies think about increased risk from the regulatory model in California. So, as we go through this capital rotation process, as we look to optimize our repatriation program and also optimize our internal cash flows and management across our business, our goal is to try to preempt as much of that $1.64 billion of future equity as we can. So that\u2019s one priority. Secondly, one of the interesting observations from the credit rating agencies was how much they valued the diversity of our model. So, as opposed to being a company that has the majority of this assets just in California, they view the acquisition of Oncor and the diversity into another regulatory market quite constructively. And interestingly, Steve, they also felt like the diversification in Peru and Chile also had notable benefits from a qualitative standpoint. Steve Fleishman : And then, maybe just in terms of on the LNG and Cameron, so any better sense of kind of the timing within 2019 for the trains to produce LNG and just how long is there between starting to produce to being officially commercial? Jeff Martin : Right. Just as a brief comment, I\u2019ll pass it to Joe, if he wants to add some color. But I said this in my prepared remarks, then this is essentially the top priority for us. We understand, Steve, the impact that this means to us from a credit standpoint and from an earning standpoint. And we have had delays in the past. We are working very aggressively with our partners to stay on track here. So, our fundamental view of turnkey in all three trains next year, so they are in a position to produce LNG is unchanged. But Joe, just because you were at the site briefly, do you want to add any additional color in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about it? Joe Householder : Look, we\u2019re not going to give a pinpoint date of each. We definitely have dates that we are working toward, but we still have one more rainy season, one hurricane season to get through. So, look, I think, you are going to see the three coming on line earlier in the year, mid part of the year, later in the year. And I think that\u2019s what we are moving toward. As we get closer to having the first phase done, we will be able to give you a little bit more color, but that would be later in the year when we will have more certainty. And then each one takes several months to get the commissioning done and then get into revenue. So, clearly, we are going to have revenues from train one and train two as we move through. And then, the question about train three will sort of be when do they get done, towards the end of \u201819 and we just don\u2019t have a precise date for that yet. Steve Fleishman : And then, lastly, just thoughts on ability to get new contracts. I think on the last call, you said hope for maybe even MoU sometime by the end of this year, is that still possible? Joe Householder : We certainly [multiple speakers] that is possible. We believe that\u2019s possible, Steve, and we are working hard toward that. Operator : And now, we will take a follow-up question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Housekeeping ones, probably for Trevor. Can you remind us the impact that tax reform has in terms of the interest deductibility for Sempra? Trevor Mihalik : Yes. We put that out last year. Largely, what we said is -- we spoke about the overall impact last year of approximately $0.30 -- $0.25, $0.30 for the impact of tax reform in 2018. But with regard to interest deductibility, it\u2019s largely neutral in \u201818 and going forward. Michael Lapides : One other thing, can you remind us size at the year-end of 2017 or now the size of the NOL and what kind of cash tax payers Sempra expects to be in the coming years? Trevor Mihalik : Right now, what we\u2019re saying is we have roughly -- I think it\u2019s a little over 4 billion of NOLs and we don\u2019t foresee being a cash tax payer over the next four, five, six years. Jeff Martin : Outside of our plan. Trevor Mihalik : Yes, outside of our plan. Operator : And that will conclude our question-and answer-session. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff Martin for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Let me just conclude by saying how much we appreciate everyone joining our call. And we\u2019ll hope that you will mark your calendars for the 28th of June to join us in New York. Also, if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team. Wish you all a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

We enjoyed the opportunity to talk about our strategic goals, planned assets sales, financial projections and long-term vision. Since the analyst conference, we've had the opportunity to continue this dialogue and I've met with over 100 investors. We appreciate the positive feedback we continue to receive on our plan and are committed delivering and long-term value to all of our shareholders. Our management team continues to focus on three things; number one, advancing our strategic vision to become the premier North American energy infrastructure company with leadership positions in the most attractive market; number two, strengthen our balance sheet to support our strategic initiatives; and number three, making progress on our existing and new projects that fit our transmission and distribution and long-term contracted business model. As we discussed in New York, our focus is on delivering shareholder value through superior earnings per share and dividend per share growth. On today's call, I'll provide an update on some of the topics covered at our Analyst Day, new project announcements and the progress we're seeing in our LNG business. Afterwards, Trevor will review our second quarter financials, the key drivers influencing our results and our guidance. I'd like to highlight that we\u2019re reaffirming our full year 2018 adjusted earnings guidance of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. Please turn to the next Slide. In late June, we communicated our strategic vision. It's focused on high grading our portfolio with transmission and distribution investments and long-term contracted assets in tier 1 markets, all with a focus of becoming America's premier energy infrastructure company. In conjunction with this effort, we announced the planned sales of our U.S. wind, U.S. solar and certain U.S. midstream assets. Since then, we've launched the sales process and hired advisors and we continue to be very encouraged by the substantial market interest we received. Also you recall at the Analysts Day, we discussed the need for an additional $1.6 billion of equity in order to reach our targeted capital structure for the Oncor transaction of approximately 65% equity to total capital. Related to this, in mid-July, we executed on the issuance of $1.1 billion of common equity forwards and $500 million of mandatory convertible preferred shares. We're pleased to say that both offerings were very well received by the market. In fact, both offerings experienced robust demand and in combination were 3 times oversubscribed. Additionally, the green shoots on each of the securities were fully exercised by the underwriters, bringing the total expected gross proceeds to $1.85 billion. As I mentioned earlier, the funds raised we used to complete our targeted financing structure that we provided both to the market and the Public Utilities Commission of Texas for the Oncor transaction, and will help ensure that our company is positioned for success going forward. Also as we laid out at our analyst conference, our long-term vision includes providing industry leading earnings per share and dividend per share growth, while maintaining an investment grade plus credit rating over the long-term. Notably, our initiatives to high-grade our portfolio and reduce our risk profile have allowed Moody\u2019s to consider revising our FFO to debt threshold down to between 16% and 17%. We believe this is appropriate and achievable range, and should allow us to effectively execute our capital plans. Moving on to the wildfire issue. We along with other stakeholders continue to execute our three pronged strategy designed to help mitigate the risk to our customers and help ensure the long-term health of California Utilities. Given the recent progress from the formation of the special legislative committee, bills in the legislature and Governor Brown's proposal to specifically address inverse condemnation, we\u2019re optimistic that appropriate legislation could be put in place to address this issue by the end of this month. Also I\u2019d like to briefly touch on our recent conversations with Elliott Bluescape partnership. We\u2019re highly engaged in constructive dialogue at the highest levels of each organization and have had multiple face-to-face meetings. Most recently, three of our Board members met with members of the Elliott Bluescape partnership with their offices in New York. In our view, all parties had strong interest in maximizing shareholder value and constructive conversations are continuing. At the end of the day, our management team believes our disciplined North American focused strategy should create significant long-term shareholder value, and we\u2019re extremely focused on executing the strategic vision. Now please turn to the next Slide. We continue to make great progress on our existing and new projects. Let me start by discussing our LNG projects where we believe we\u2019re well positioned to help meet the world's growing natural gas demand with Cameron and three other LNG development opportunities. First, the construction of Cameron trains one through three continues to progress. The facility remains on track for all three trains to produce LNG in 2019, which McDermott recently affirmed on their earnings call. In addition, in mid-July Total completed its acquisition of on Engie\u2019s LNG assets. We\u2019re actually quite excited to have Total as the new partner. It is a well-led company and has a growing leadership position in the space and we look forward to work with them on this project and potential expansion opportunities at the facility. Shifting to our other LNG opportunities as highlighted at the recent analyst conference. We\u2019re highly encouraged by our progress. We recently selected an EPC contractor for ECA and continue to receive significant market interest given the project\u2019s West Coast location. We also selected an EPC contractor for Port Arthur and announced the heads of agreement with the Polish Oil and Gas company, outlining terms for a 20-year proposed agreement to supply two Mtpa of LNG, which is in addition to the memorandum of understanding signed with KOGAS just last year. Please turn to the next slide where I\u2019ll review new projects and our other businesses. Starting with the IEnova, we continue to establish a dominant market position in the liquid storage business and we\u2019re recently awarded the Topolobampo Marine terminal project. Additionally, we announced an expansion of the Veracruz terminal and redistribution of capacity at the Mexico City and Pueblo terminals. Related to these updates, the total investment for the terminals at Veracruz, Mexico City and Pueblo is now expected to be $315 million, which is $40 million increase. In Chile, Chiquita recently announced the acquisition of two operating transmission lines for $220 million subject to customary regulatory approvals. A good portion of these operating assets are within Chiquita service territory and are already integrated with their existing distribution infrastructure. The transaction is likely to close in the second half of 2018 as expected to be funded with cash on hand in Chile. The projects in Mexico and Chile support the strategy we developed along with our board, which seeks to high-grade our portfolio through a T&D and long-term contracted assets. Just as importantly, they\u2019ll help improve energy accessibility and resiliency in both countries. Turning now to California. We recently submitted an application for a natural gas leak abatement program per Senate Bill 1371. We requested a CapEx amount of approximately $115 million. It would be deployed over a three year period. This program will help ensure the delivery of safe, reliable natural gas and further the state\u2019s goal of reducing GHG emission. An additional cost to development was the CPUCs mitigation report released at the beginning of July, which directed us to increase the storage volume of Aliso Canyon from approximately 24.6 bcf to roughly 34 bcf. This further supports our stance that Aliso and and natural gas are an integral component of energy reliability and affordability in Southern California. More than 90% of Southern California residence depends on natural gas for the daily needs. By some estimates converting to all electric appliances could cost the average household to over $7,000 upfront and upto $1,000 per year and increase appliance and energy costs. That\u2019s why from a customer perspective, we certainly support trends towards electrification while also supporting the ongoing role of natural gas. With that, let me hand it over to Trevor who will review our financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks Jeff. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter loss of $561 million or $2.11 per share. These results include the impairment charges, primarily related to our U. S. natural gas storage business, which we discussed at our Analyst Day. This compares to the second quarter 2017 earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $361 million or $1.35 per share. This compares to the second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $276 million or $1.10 per share. Let\u2019s turn to the next slide where I\u2019ll discuss the key drivers impacting our quarterly results. Our adjusted quarter results were primarily driven by the following; $114 million of earnings at the Sempra Texas Utility segment due to the acquisition of our interest in Oncor in March of 2018; and $46 million of higher earnings at the Sempra Mexico segment, primarily due to favorable foreign currency and inflation related impact net of hedges. This is partially offset by $81 million, primarily related to higher interest expense and preferred dividends at parent, which includes the impact of the Oncor acquisition financing. With these results, we are reaffirming our 2018 adjusted earnings guidance of $5.30 to $5.80 per share and GAAP guidance of $1.78 to $2.28 per share but we continue to monitor the peso movements relative to our guidance assumptions. Please turn to the next slide and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot Trevor. I want to emphasize that execution of our strategic plan to create long-term shareholder value remains top of mind. In the near term, our management team is focused on the following items : Resolving our general rate cases, executing the sale of our U.S. wind, U.S. solar and certain U.S. midstream assets, progressing the construction of Cameron and advancing our California wildfire risk mitigation strategy. Also, I\u2019d like to take that opportunity to again thank everyone who participating in recent equity offering, the shareholder support we receive is important to us in terms of delivering our long-term vision of delivering quality growth and value creation. With that, we\u2019ll conclude our prepared remarks and start to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Jeff, you mentioned at the beginning of your discussion a targeted FFO to debt level. And I was just thinking through Sempra has a number of upside growth potential areas of spending. And as you look at it now when you look at your projected financials, your projected FFO to debt level, if you were successful in some of those incremental growth opportunities, what does that debt target level tell us. Does that imply you have some degree of dry powder with respect to leverage? Or does it mean we should assume a more traditional need for incremental equity if you have incremental applied CapEx? Jeff Martin : I\u2019ll give you a few comments and then pass it to Trevor. But in general, we\u2019ve been impressed from time-to-time about what is your specific FFO to debt target. And as you know, we spent a lot of time choreographing our strategic plan with all three credit rating agencies. I think what we\u2019ve tried to do really is make sure that we are very, very clear that we expect to maintain an investment grade plus credit rating. I think the second thing we tried to do is spend a lot of time explaining where we were a decade ago, where we\u2019d exposure to IPP businesses, where we\u2019d exposure to commodity businesses and how we pretty concerted effort of trying to high-grade the portfolio where we can have a lot more transparency about our future cash flows. We really found that to be around the transmission distribution type of assets. So what we've done in Texas, we announced that we recently had in Chile this is really the ongoing focus. And what that's really resulted in is the type of dialog and conversations you see come out of Moody\u2019s where they are open minded about reducing our overall risk profile. So our goal is to make sure that we\u2019re really doing everything as a business in terms of cash flows, repatriation and divestitures to support the type of growth initiatives you\u2019re referring to. I\u2019ll stop there and see Trevor if you want to add any comments to that. Trevor Mihalik : Stephen, the only other thing I\u2019d add really is one of the things once Cameron comes online that is a significant change in the cash flows for the organization, which will certainly support the FFO to debt metrics. And so depending on what we monetize the wind and the solar assets for could significantly help with the growth prospects. And again, what we laid out at the analyst conference with regards to the $15 billion capital plan and the incremental equity offering that we just completed, we believe over the period of time, we will be in a position to support our investment grade plus credit rating. Stephen Byrd : And then shifting gears to California. So I think the very large recent wildfires highlight the seriousness of the issue and we certainly hear regularly from investors the urgent need to have legislation. I was curious in your dialog you mentioned you were I think optimistic or hopeful that we\u2019d see legislation in the session. Can you talk little bit about the dialogue you\u2019ve had, what gives you some optimism in terms of ensuring that we get legislation that the investment community very much wants to see? Jeff Martin : Well, I\u2019m glad you asked that question and obviously this is top of mind to lot of investors. I\u2019ll provide a couple of comments and ask Joe to provide some comments as well. I think the way I thought about Stephen is last fall it was really a process of problem identification. Obviously, the CPUC ruled on our WEMS decision, which put a lot of this in play in terms of how people thought about the problem. In the first quarter of 2018, there was a large education process. I think part of that was really aimed at making sure that people understood that this was not a problem, it was unique to the California investor-owned utilities, the impacted municipals, impacted the residential communities\u2019 ability to procure insurance, it had a broad impact to the state. And I think one of the things we could be more pleased about now is to see the type of leadership coming out of both houses of the legislature the governor has really stepped forward. And I think the conversation today is less about one particular bill number or one particular assembly bill number, and really about the value what\u2019s taking place in the conference committee. So there's a committee meeting tomorrow on safe and reliable energy grid and there's a committee meeting on Thursday on inverse condemnation and electric utilities. I think the dialogue has progressed to the point that is right where it should be. We\u2019ve got the right people focused on the right issues, it\u2019s being redefined more broadly as a statewide issue and not an investor and utility issue and I think that's part of my calls for optimism. Now I\u2019ll see Joe if you like to supplement that. Joe Householder : I would just add a couple of things. I think that the governor wants healthy utilities, he wants to further his energy policies and his agenda and the IoUs play a large role in that. So I think as Jeff mentioned two weeks ago, the conference committee had their first meeting. We have the opportunity to participate in that meeting. We were the only investor owned utility that was at that meeting. But our director of the Firesign's employment adoption, he was there at that meeting and now tomorrow they\u2019re having this meeting. And it\u2019s not only members from each of the California investor-owned utilities but also people who are representing the municipals. So this is a statewide issue it\u2019s not just investor-owned. So we\u2019re encouraged that they\u2019re having that meeting tomorrow followed by another meeting on Thursday. The agenda for that meeting isn\u2019t out yet. You can see these other agendas on their Web site. But we are encouraged about this. We\u2019re working with the various stakeholders in this and we see the opportunity for some movement this month while the legislature finishes its work this year. Operator : Moving on we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Maybe is it possible you give a little more color on maybe where there\u2019re areas of agreement or disagreement on? Jeff Martin : As I mentioned this in my prepared remarks and obviously we went -- took a team back to New York. Jesse Cohen is the Head of the National Practice and that\u2019s who I\u2019ve been dealing with directly. I think all of the conversations you expect us to be having they\u2019re being had, the conversations are quite constructive. And I think that the most important thing is the issues that we\u2019re all focused on are the right issues. It\u2019s really around making sure that we\u2019re continuing to try to find a way to not only have an identity ventures with Elliott Bluescape but also making sure we\u2019re thinking of the interest of all of our shareholders. So I am actually quite optimistic that the tone of the conversations are good, all the right people are engaged and I remain very optimistic about it. Steve Fleishman : And then just on the -- you mentioned Moody\u2019s in the 16% to 17%. I assume you\u2019re saying that\u2019s consistent with where your plan roughly gets you to then, that kind of range\u2026 Jeff Martin : I appreciate that question, because we spent a little bit of time at the analyst conference talking about how much time we\u2019ve been spending with the credit rating agencies, a lot of that as you know, was as we approach the Oncor transaction last summer we had laid out our long-term plans with a view of making sure that we can accommodate that type of transaction. So we've always been fairly high touch with respect to the credit rating agencies. But over the last nine months, in particular, it's been a very engaged process. So when we got to analysts conferences, it\u2019s really about laying out the fact that, yes, we're doing all the right things to make sure that we're managing our cash flows and supporting our balance sheet and I've talked about some of those. But it was also about making sure that we got the message across about what impact our focus on the portfolio should have to our risk profile. And I think that's reflected in what Moody's said. So it's probably less about whether we've created a cushion or not created a cushion. We need to make sure that we're executing the way that we've laid it out, because we do think there's a lot of opportunities in front of us and making sure we're very closely aligned with agencies is important to us. Steve Fleishman : And do you have an idea of when they're going to resolve their review, or outlook? Jeff Martin : I'll pass it to Trevor. Trevor Mihalik : They have come out and recently published on us. And as Jeff said, they have given us a period of time as a result of the Oncor acquisition and the Oncor financing associated with that. That over a period of time, we could get to the appropriate equity structure of 6535. And while we have done the equity offerings, a lot of those are under forward contracts. And so the expected proceeds will come in over time. And so the agencies gave us approximately 18 months to get the Oncor financing in place. And then of course it also -- like we said earlier, the proceeds from the expected sale will also have a significant impact. Jeff Martin : And what I would add to that, Steve, too is I think part of the value here, just like as management communicates with The Street, part of it is making sure that when you sit down to credit rating agencies, you deliver what you tell them you're going to deliver. So just last year we actually exceeded our FFO to debt metrics, which was one of our goals. We set out some goals about the targeted capital structure, not only do we deliver, we delivered it early and that's one of the things we're trying to make sure is that we follow through on these types of things. I think the wildcard continues to be the issues that Stephen raised which is what takes place with the California regulatory environment. So I would expect that the agencies will be very much geared to seeing what takes place in the legislative environment. And that really was one of the wildcards that was not factored in last fall when we were talking about the Oncor transaction. So part of this is to stay closely aligned, deliver what we think is some improvements from the legislation going forward. And I think there is some alignment in the state to do that. Operator : Moving on we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Joe, I wanted to follow-up on the two town developments, obviously, well anticipated. But how does that change the marketing efforts on the Cameron expansion [Technical Difficulty]? And then secondly I suppose in tandem hard to ignore the developments in China around their tariff. How does that impact thus far your efforts across the portfolio of projects you\u2019re pursuing? Jeff Martin : I'll kick this off and pass it to Joe, but let me just start with Total. I think I may have mentioned this at the conference. But when we were at the World Gas Conference with Octavio and Joe, we have a chance to have dinner with Patrick Pouyanne at Total. And I am personally impressed with them as a company. I said him up in my prepared remarks I think it's a very well led company. And I think they have a very ambitious view of an integrated natural gas strategy. They've targeted having about 40 million tons per annum as part of their portfolio by 2020, both balanced between roughly half of that being equity owned gas. So that\u2019s a conversation we\u2019re going to continue. And I think we\u2019re glad to have them as a partner at Cameron. And certainly, they\u2019ve even said publicly that they\u2019re very interested to participate in the expansion process there. So as you think about the marketing activities, I view Cameron, one, is more of relationship management and advancing the interest of our existing customers at that facility. And then in terms of the larger issue you\u2019re raising about China and tariff issues, at this point, it\u2019s tough to -- maybe even premature to forecast the impacts of that. But I think what I am a little bit confident about is LNG is an important part of China\u2019s future. We certainly see that as the key field that will help push coal off of their grid. And frankly, the United States will always be one of the lowest cost suppliers and we think this just bodes well for the future. But I\u2019ll pass it on to Joe to see if he\u2019ll make any more comments about the marketing impacts. Joe Householder : I think you pretty much summed it up, but I will say in a number of conversations that I had with as they were working with us to request all they approvals needed to make that acquisition. They emphasized a number of times that they really only did this because they wanted to have the access to the expansion. And so they\u2019re very open about that and want to engage in that topic. And I had some conversations with some other partners and I think we\u2019re all starting to see that, especially as we see one, two and three coming toward . And so our focus is staying on one, two, three but I think we have to start engaging in discussions around that. And I think that Total will bring a lot to that discussion. And I don\u2019t have anything else to add on the tariffs evolving\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then maybe can I just bring it back to another issue to get a little bit more clarity on the credit side. Obviously, the 16% to 17% thresholds mentioned a couple of times here. But it\u2019s predicated in part on the business mix change I presume. What\u2019s the timeframe on the sales, and is that what\u2019s linked here to get the affirmation of the outlook, I suppose separately and distinctly from California resolution? And maybe to tackle on the second piece, to that end in terms of business mix, obviously, you\u2019re making pretty explicit efforts on several of your assets. Should we read by the acquisition of the Chilean assets of late that perhaps that\u2019s maybe firmly off the table? Jeff Martin : I think there\u2019s about three questions in there, Julien. So let me make a rundown. I think that I would probably decouple this first issue of whether this 16% to 17% is tied to the divestitures. The 16% to 17% is a reformed view by Moody\u2019s about the measures we\u2019ve taken over the last three to five years to reposition the portfolio. So it\u2019s based upon their view of the existing portfolio and really the Capstone investment in that trend line around Oncor. Secondly, I do want to emphasize that how we handle the divestiture is really important to us. There is a fairly wide range of outcomes that could occur there. Our Chief Strategy Officer, Dennis Arriola is leading that divestiture campaign and we\u2019ve been very aggressive rile to shoot to get that moving, so that\u2019s something we look forward to making comments on to in the future. And then to your third question about Chile, it\u2019s definitely not off the table. I think what we\u2019ve tried to say is we\u2019ve laid out a very disciplined phased approach to our strategy about what we\u2019re going to basically articulate, both with our Board and the market in Q1 of next year and then in the following Q1 of 2020. And what we\u2019re trying to do is to say that acquisition is reflected of how you run the business, whether you\u2019re a buyer or seller you\u2019re looking to partner. So we\u2019re going to look at our international business with fresh eyes, I mean the legal term is de novo. We\u2019re going to start from the bottoms up and we\u2019re going to try get to the best possible answer near term and long term for our investors. So there is absolutely nothing off the table that was an ordinary course bolt-on to the existing franchise, which we quite frankly think makes it more valuable. Joe Householder : One thing I\u2019d say is that that transaction we discussed at our analyst meeting too, so that was in Dennis's slide deck as well. Operator : Moving on we\u2019ll take the next question from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : So you just actually did touch on my Chilean question that Julien just asked. But I\u2019m curious whatever decision you guys choose with South America. Is there an opportunity to reach a conclusion and a decision before you built Cameron, or should we thinking about any strategic decision you think about with South America would have to be as you get closer to Cameron? Jeff Martin : We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we're trying to improve our balance sheet and part of what we tried to explain at the analyst conference was the choreography that there's a timeline that allows you to look more aggressively at the portfolio and that timeline was choreographed against how we repatriate cash today and improve our balance sheet near term. Obviously, to your point Shahriar it\u2019s really an inflection point in 2020 and we expect to have obviously all three trains fully up and running. And that gives us a lot more flexibility with respect to our balance sheet. But prior to that time, you can sell assets like wind or solar once which are not, quote-unquote credit dilutive But as you look at transactions which could be credit dilutive, there are scenarios where those can also be advantageous to our shareholders we just have to choreograph those. And that\u2019s why we laid it out in a three-phase approach. The ones which can be beneficial to our balance sheet today, at least in the near term we've articulated is phase one. And we will look at the South American and international businesses between now and Q1 of next year, because we're getting closer to obviously having each of the trains producing LNG. So there is a certain timeline to that. But certainly we can make a decision on South America prior to the full commission of every train at Cameron. Shahriar Pourreza : And just let me ask you one last one, because it -- sometimes it\u2019s a source of confusion is. I mean clearly from your slide decks in your prepared remarks. I mean, you echo becoming a premier North American infrastructure company. So that inherently assumes LNG and IEnova remain very strategic to us for Sempra [Multiple Speakers]\u2026 Jeff Martin : Well, I think this goes back to the timeline question as well, which is what we tried to say is that phase one is the opportunity to transact on assets today in North America where we think we can redeploy the capital more effectively. Phase two is going to be bottoms up review of our international businesses with the focus on South America. Obviously, that's choreographed against the strength of our balance sheet. You\u2019ll recall that I described the fact that each of the credit rating agencies have assigned more value to Peru and Chile from a credit standpoint, because of the regulatory diversity and they are very, very high FFO to debt right. So as we go forward and continue to improve our balance sheet, it gives us more flexibility there. And with respect LNG, I think we talked about this. We were very intent on trying to highlight value with our LNG business as part of our TRV vehicle, much like an MLP, as that market went away, we\u2019re going to continue to develop that business. And it\u2019s really, Shahriar about looking for that efficient frontier whereas we develop that business and build scale and greater visibility to cash flows, we certainly would welcome the opportunity to that to market to create value for our shareholders. Joe, would you like to add anything to that? Joe Householder : These two businesses are important parts of our growth. And since 2012, they created $40 a share value in our stock price and we think that that can be significantly higher. So we think both of those are great infrastructure growth areas. I think there is lot of complementary parts to them and so I think those are keen focus for us. What we do with them over time, we\u2019ll see but I think that for us right now they are priority. Operator : Moving on we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Of the three LNG projects in the growth pipeline, which of the three whether Cameron 4 and 5, Port Arthur and Costa Azul, do you think is further ahead in the process relative to the other ones, and why? Jeff Martin : Well, I\u2019ll take a shot at this Joe and you can chip in with me. But I think what\u2019s interesting about your question is each of them have their own unique attributes from a marketing standpoint. I described in an earlier question that the Cameron expansion feels more like a relationship management issue. Obviously, we\u2019re focused on getting trains one through three done, that\u2019s the laser focus of our entire LNG business obviously. But having Total in the mix now, I think makes it more important that we\u2019re building great relationships with those three customers, being able to build trains four and five will be a huge opportunity for us. On the West Coast, clearly as you see more and more natural gas coming out of the Gulf. It\u2019s pretty intriguing if you can actually develop a project where you can access San Juan or Permian gas and take it off the West Coast of North America. So as you can imagine, those people that want destination flexibility want to have a shorter time to the Asian markets without going through the Panama Canal and the issues there. That certainly is drawing a tremendous amount of interest. And frankly, Port Arthur is very well situated geographically. There are lot of folks who understand the value of the Port Arthur, particularly as you saw some affirmation of that Michael with the recent HoA we signed with Poland, which by the way, most people were surprised to see that that was a 20 year agreement. So I think each of these three facilities provide some unique marketing advantages. One of the things that\u2019s intriguing before I pass it to Joe is much like back in the IPP days Mike when you used to talk about system sales that was how the California Department of Water Resources contract was structured, there's a lot of interest in some of the conversations with Octavio\u2019s team is having around participating in more than one project, which I think is also interesting. And Joe, perhaps you can add some color to the question. Joe Householder : Michael, I think I\u2019ve said this before. We don\u2019t particularly prioritize them that way, because each of them has a little bit different situation and each of them has a lot of interest, as Jeff was saying. And so when we were at the World Gas Conference, Jeff and myself with Octavio and some of his team, we talked to a number of different important buyers who each have different interest in them. So clearly, there are some at Cameron we have permits. At ICA we have permits. We\u2019re working on and hope to finalize our permit at Port Arthur this year. We\u2019re working with EPC contractors now at both the other facilities. And so each of them is a little bit different, we like them all and don't prioritize one over the other in like we want that one first and put all the team on that one. At this point, we're looking at all of them because they all have good opportunity. Michael Lapides : And can I ask just a question about ICA, regarding the energy , meaning the pipeline infrastructure in Mexico needed to get Permian, let's say, Permian gas over to ICA. Just curious how difficult, how easy or hard would it be to actually permit those. Do you have some of the same issues that some of the other developers, folks like TransCanada seen getting pipelines built in Mexico? Just curious in terms of how realistic this is. Jeff Martin : Well, I would just say, we talked a little bit about the mid-scale project, Michael, which is 2.5 Mtpa. We expect to use existing American pipeline system for that by enlarge to get it to this part of the country. If we go to the larger scale project, which is 11 Mtpa, we expect that that\u2019s probably a new pipeline. I don't think we've determined yet whether the route is most efficacious to bring it across Northern Mexico or bring a portion of it across the United States. But I can tell you the key is having access to Permian. If you can actually do that in a way that's cost effective and basically launch LNG off the West Coast, it is hugely -- has a lot of interest from the market. Joe, you want comment on the pipeline? Joe Householder : I would only add on to that. We've built in or partnered with 11 of the 14 pipelines built in Mexico, so we have not had a problem getting them permitted. Operator : Moving on we'll take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : What's the impact of the recently announced and potential future Chile investments on the expectation for cash repatriation from South America? And what's the return profile for the recent announced projects? Jeff Martin : I'll pass it to Trevor. Go ahead Trevor. Trevor Mihalik : Right now the repatriation that we announced with $1.6 billion over five years with, call it roughly 400 to 500 coming in 2018, none of that cash is coming from Mexico, that's all cash coming from Chile -- or none of its coming from Chile, it's coming from Peru and Mexico. So the cash and we're going to be using for the investment in that transmission lines is just cash that is the cash in Chile. Jeff Martin : The second part of his question was the return expectations, it's immediately accretive and Dennis you want to add anything to those investments? Dennis Arriola : We look at this and one of the things that we really liked about this was that is strategic, because the operating assets are actually part of our system right now. When you look at the vast majority of the transmission assets there, they are already associated with our, so there's their synergies there. But from a return perspective, we were -- I think we're smart about it. We're looking for double-digit leverage returns, high single-digit unlevered returns. And again, we're using existing cash from our business. This is a good investment regardless of whether we continue to stay in the country and grow, or if we decided to monetize in the future it only enhances the overall value. Joe Householder : The only thing I would also add to that is that these assets are in into service territory as well, so it's a natural follow on. Ryan Levine : Are there any additional opportunities in Chile? Dennis Arriola : We're looking at it. Obviously, given where we're located outside of Santiago, there are some additional add-ons. We're continuing to look at some of the zonal transmission bids and the national ones. But again, we're only going to do this if it makes sense or if it\u2019s complimentary to our existing system. We\u2019re not just going to go chase an investment because it\u2019s in the country of Chile. Ryan Levine : And could you comment on the current appetite for additional U.S. acquisitions? Jeff Martin : We don\u2019t comment on M&A generally. I think that what we\u2019ve laid out right now is we\u2019ve got a fairly aggressive capital program going forward. We\u2019ll continue to look at things if we think it\u2019s strategic to us. I think we\u2019ve been very clear about the types of things we\u2019re interested and particularly in transmission and distribution, so that\u2019s an area we\u2019ll continue to follow. But I think we\u2019re really focused Ryan on executing our plan and we\u2019ll stay close to the markets which are most important to us which are California, Texas and Mexico. Ryan Levine : And then regarding the ICA mid scale project, what\u2019s the current outlook for permitting for that project? And are there any developments on that front? Joe Householder : We basically have the full permit for the larger scale project and we\u2019re working with government agency to modify that to accommodate this and hope to do that over the next couple of months. Operator : Moving on we\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : So want to just follow up on the asset sale. The $1.87 billion approximately assets held for sale, the vast majority of that I assume is the in wind and midstream and what have you. How much should we think is the tax basis for that? Jeff Martin : How much you think the tax basis is for what we\u2019re selling? Paul Patterson : Yes. Trevor Mihalik : Well again I would just say on the $1.87 billion, the impairment was roughly $1.5 billion associated with that and then 900 after-tax. On the tax basis for those assets, you can assume that the tax basis is actually fairly low in those assets, mostly from bonus depreciation and then also on the wind side associated with a lot of those, and we\u2019ve sold down half of the interest on the wind side through the tax partnership structures. Joe Householder : And Paul, you know we have large NOLs so it will not be a big cash impact with the tax effect. Paul Patterson : And then just could you remind us what the earnings associate with those assets are? Jeff Martin : You can see that we\u2019ve published that at the analyst conference call, so you can see those assets for \u201918, \u201919 and \u201820 in the guidance ranges because we gave at that segment level. It goes up to roughly -- it goes from about $80 million to $100 million per year on the wind and solar side, and the midstream assets that we\u2019re selling are at a loss today. Paul Patterson : I just want to see if there has been any change in that. And then just finally on the -- I guess we\u2019ve been having ex parte discussions at the California PUC. And I was wondering if there was any -- if you knew what that was about, or just what is that about, do you what it is about? Jeff Martin : As you read any ex parte notification and talks about the overall scope of the ex parte conversations and afterwards they make a filing relative to that. And I\u2019ll refer you to the public record on , Paul. Paul Patterson : I did see the record on it. I guess just wondering if that's a normal thing or I don\u2019t -- I hear you, I\u2019ll just -- I appreciate your comments. Thanks so much. Operator : Moving on we\u2019ll take our final question from Lasan Johong from Auvila Research Consulting. Lasan Johong : I\u2019ll just ask two questions. First of all, what's your California risk appetite? And what I mean by that is if you had opportunities to make additional acquisitions or as a muni call for IOU. Is that something that would be interesting? And a follow up to Ryan\u2019s question, and the reason I why ask is obviously PG&E announced that they maybe splitting up the company. My second question is with regard to President Trump's comments to Angela Merkel about importing Russian gas in light of that comment has Sempra seen an uptick in interest from either Eastern Europe or Europe in general for U.S. LNG. And is this something that is real or is it just political? Jeff Martin : With respect to the M&A question, obviously broadly speaking, we don\u2019t typically comment on M&A. But I\u2019d probably answer it this way that last summer before we have these wildfire issues here in California, we have made the decision that we thought Texas was a great market from a regulatory standpoint, that they had good demographic growth, constructive regulation, and it was something that was a target of interest for us but calls of the T&D focus. But I think that gave us a great opportunity, number one, it gets more regulatory diversity. And given where we're at in our discussions with the credit rating agencies that guides you to thinking where you\u2019d be more focused at this point in time. And then on your second question, we certainly have followed both pipelines in the Germany, both Nord Stream 1 as well as Nord Stream 2, and I think the President has been spot on. I think you go back to the 2014 EU charter there has been an emphasis for the entire EU community to diversify their fuel supply for their energy markets. So I think this is really an opportunity, that\u2019s why we talked about little bit earlier about the importance of Port Arthur and the ability of some of these facilities that we have in the Gulf to access to Western European marketplace. We continue to think that the drivers there are more around energy security and energy independence, which was somewhat different from the drivers that we discussed at the analyst conference for Asia. So we certainly think it\u2019s a political statement that the president has made, the work he has done with the EU is actually quite constructive for the entire LNG industry here in the U.S. Operator : At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Martin for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Well, look we\u2019re very appreciative of everyone joining our call today. Per custom, if you have any follow-up questions feel free to contact the IR team and have a great day. Operator : And that will conclude today's conference. We do thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Householder - Sempra Energy Trevor Ian Mihalik - Sempra Energy Analysts : Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Faisel Khan. Please go ahead, sir. Faisel H. Khan - Sempra Energy : Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter 2018 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team including Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President and Group President; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2018 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 7, 2018, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Faisel, and thank you all for joining us today. The third quarter was quite busy for us here at Sempra. We recently held a strategic update call where we discussed the announced InfraREIT and Sharyland transactions, and our renewable sales agreement with ConEd. This quarter's strong financial results add to this positive momentum. And together with this week's LNG announcements, further advances our strategic vision to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. Today, we'll be providing more color on the progress we're making related to our disciplined phased approach to our strategic vision. Specifically, we'll be discussing how we're progressing. Cameron Phase 1, advancing our LNG development opportunities through this week's announced Heads of Agreements and memorandum of understanding, high-grading our portfolio and strengthening our balance sheet. But to be clear, we're committed to maximizing shareholder value through all these activities. We believe this can be achieved through our superior, projected earnings per share and dividend per share growth, coupled with our T&D risk profile. We'll continue to make disciplined investments tied directly to this strategy. I'd like to briefly discuss this construction progress at Cameron. The successful completion of this project remains a top priority. As we have stated all along, we continue to believe all three train will be producing LNG in 2019. We also remain confident in McDermott and Chiyoda's ability to deliver a state-of-the-art facility. Later in this presentation, Joe will provide some additional details regarding the commissioning of train 1 and other construction activities. In addition, we're working hard to make real progress on our LNG opportunities. Joe just spent two weeks in Asia and Carlos and I were in Europe meeting with our partners and potential customers. We received significant interest and hope to continue building our relationships in those two regions. Our recently-announced MOU and HOAs are a direct results of those marketing efforts. Please turn to the next slide. I'm pleased to say we continue to make great strides with our vision to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. An integral component of that vision is our commitment to continue to improve the visibility of our T&D earnings mix, which we are able to do through our recently-announced Texas acquisitions. These transactions require no incremental equity and we expect to fund them with a portion of the proceeds from our announced U.S. solar portfolio sale. Furthermore, we're continuing to make progress on the sale of our U.S. wind and certain U.S. midstream assets as originally announced in June. We're currently engaged in an active sales process with very strong initial market interest. Lastly, we're continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We plan to pay down parent debt with the portion of the proceeds from the announced asset sales and the settlements of our common equity forwards. And with that, I'll hand it off to Joe. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to highlight some of the recent projects we've captured that are incremental to our plan. I am particularly pleased with this week's announcements of the MOU with Total and the three HOA agreements for the ECA Phase 1 project. I'll discuss these in more detail in just a moment. Oncor is now projecting CapEx of approximately $10.5 billion over five years compared to the $8.4 billion over five years that we discussed at our analyst conference. The portion of this growth can be attributed to, number one, interconnecting the Rayburn County Electric Cooperative into ERCOT. Two, building approximately 30 130-kV transmission projects in 2019 and 2020, largely comprised of greenfield and brownfield lines. And third, adding two 345-kV projects in West Texas. They're part of a new transmission loop to support increased load growth in the Permian Basin. IEnova continues to expand its strong position in Mexico. Most recently, it announced the acquisition of a 51% equity interest in the Manzanillo marine terminal project. IEnova will build the terminal, which has a total estimated cost of approximately $200 million. The facility is expected to go into service in late 2020. IEnova is making great progress in this new terminal business. And also recently announced a capacity agreement with BP for 50% of the Baja Refinados liquids terminal, and capacity agreements with Chevron and Marathon, each for 50% at the Topolobampo liquids terminal. Each of these terminals are now 100% contracted. IEnova continues to make great progress in diversifying its portfolio and its customer base. I would also like to briefly mention that IEnova's management team has been engaging in collaborative discussions with the incoming administration. We look forward to furthering the goal of developing critical and essential energy infrastructure designed to provide safe, reliable, and lower cost energy for the people of Mexico. Please turn to the next slide. On top of capturing incremental opportunities, there have been several positive developments at our California utilities. Specifically, we received a very constructive decision relating to the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment or PCIA reform. Announced our commitment to helping the City of San Diego's formation of Community Choice Aggregation or CCA, which we're financially neutral too as were decoupled from commodity sales. View the recently-enacted wildfire legislation as a constructive move in the right direction. Submitted a project alternative for the San Diego Pipeline Safety & Reliability Project or PSRP with total CapEx estimates that are similar to the PSRP project, and finally, filed for an increase of our FERC return on equity to 11.2%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the current 10.05%. Please turn to the next slide where I'll discuss our LNG business. As we discussed at our analyst conference, we look to create leadership positions in fast-growing addressable markets. Our LNG business fits that profile. There continues to be significant worldwide demand growth for LNG and we're well positioned with five strategically-located opportunities in North America, comprising over 45 million tonnes per annum of long-term projected capacity. Sempra is committed to growing its LNG business into a world-class organization, and over the past few months, we've made significant progress in realizing this goal, including restructuring our organization to form the North American Infrastructure group to better align our resources and enhance our visibility to execution, making great progress at Cameron, and advancing the four LNG development projects in our queue, and launching a comprehensive global marketing outreach program to further discussions with our potential customers. These efforts have proven to be effective as illustrated by our execution of the Memorandum of Understanding with Total and execution of the Heads of Agreement with Mistui, Tokyo Gas and Total for ECA Phase 1. These accomplishments speak volumes about our commitment to our LNG business. Please turn to the next slide. Our MOU with Total is a significant milestone for our LNG business and outlines the potential for Total to contract up to 9 million tonnes per annum of offtake across Cameron LNG Phase 2 and ECA Phases 1 and 2. Please turn to the next slide. The signing of the three detailed HOA agreements with Mistui, Tokyo Gas and Total for the expected LNG offtake at ECA Phase 1 represents a significant step toward negotiating and executing definitive agreements with these quality counterparties. Importantly, ECA is the only brownfield LNG opportunity on the West Coast. We believe that ECA provides a great opportunity for our customers to source low-cost U.S. shale gas and provide it to the growing markets in Asia. Please turn to the next slide and I'll discuss Cameron Phase 1 in greater detail. As Jeff already mentioned, we continue to believe that all three trains at Cameron will be producing LNG in 2019. We also have confidence in McDermott and Chiyoda in meeting the current project schedule. In fact, for train 1, all major construction activities have been completed to begin the commissioning and start-up process. Importantly, we've commenced the start-up of support systems for the three trains and commenced the refrigerant gas turbine test. This progress keeps the project on track and the remaining milestones are lined up in fairly rapid succession, namely the initial start-up of train 1 including the introduction of fuel gas into the system as well as commissioning of all three flares, and the production of first LNG from the project in the first quarter of 2019. Regarding our EPC contract and McDermott's recent announcements, I'd like to remind you that one, the EPC contract is a lump-sum turnkey fixed price agreement with established milestone payments. Two, we reached the settlement agreement with our EPC contractor, which includes Chiyoda and McDermott in December of 2017, which resolved all known and unknown issues through that date. And all Cameron joint venture partners as well as our EPC contractor, McDermott and Chiyoda, are in alignment with our expectations that all three trains are producing LNG in 2019. Now please turn to slide 11, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor who will review with you the third quarter results. Trevor Ian Mihalik - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Joe. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $274 million or $0.99 per share. This compares to third quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $57 million or $0.22 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $339 million or $1.23 per share. This compares favorably to third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $265 million or $1.04 per share. So let's turn to slide 12, where I'll discuss the key drivers impacting our quarterly results. Our adjusted earnings results were primarily driven by the following; $154 million of earnings at the Sempra Texas Utility segment due to the acquisition of our interest in Oncor in March 2018, and $39 million of higher earnings at SDG&E, primarily due to electric transmission operations. This is partially offset by $86 million of higher costs, primarily related to increased interest expense and preferred stock dividends at parent, which includes the impact of the Oncor acquisition financing, and $38 million primarily related to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency and inflation effects, net of foreign currency derivative effects at Sempra Mexico. In addition, I'd like to point out that this quarter we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $65 million in equity earnings, reflecting the full impairment of our remaining equity method investment in RBS Sempra Commodities as a result of previously-disclosed ongoing litigation in the UK. Another adverse item impacting this quarter's results is the movement in the Mexican peso. Specifically, during the quarter, we saw the peso strengthen relative to the dollar, which drove the large non-cash FX loss in Mexico. However, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we've seen the peso weaken, which has largely reversed these non-cash losses. We continue to monitor the movements in the peso relative to our guidance assumptions of a year-end rate of approximately 21 pesos to $1 and its associated impact to our full-year 2018 earnings projections. Based on strong year-to-date operating results, plus our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're reaffirming our full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share or $2.83 to $3.44 per share on a GAAP basis. Please turn to the next slide and I'll hand it back over to Jeff. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Trevor. We're pleased with this quarter's financial results and the progress of our plan to-date. However, I'd like to stress that our management team will continue to be focused on delivering our disciplined phased strategy of becoming North America's premier energy infrastructure company. We actually believe this strategy will be strengthened by the work we're undertaking with our full board. Working with the newly-created Business Development Committee, your management team will be focused on five key areas. Number one, conducting a bottoms-up strategic review of each of our businesses; number two, restructuring our corporate center activities to better support each of our businesses; number three, performing a strategic review of our businesses in South America and determining whether it's better to hold and grow partner or divest these assets; number four, completing the renewables and midstream divestitures that we've previously announced; and finally, number five, updating our financial plan to reflect these updates. With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions. Operator : And we'll take our first question from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. Just on that last set of priorities you mentioned Jeff, could you elaborate on the, I guess, it was the corporate center review in a little bit more detail and kind of what you're thinking there? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Good morning, Chris. Thank you for joining our call. Sure. As you think about the divestitures we announced back in June, where we're selling our domestic solar business, domestic wind business and our non-utility natural gas storage businesses, our parent cost \u2013 our parent activities are really intended to reflect how we support all the different businesses that we own. So as you reduce your overall asset base, we need to make sure that we're reducing our parent cost at the same time. So we'll be looking at how we can better leverage technology for repeatable processes. We'll look at resizing our head count, we'll also look at whether some functions that we do at corporate could be better done in the business unit. So, we're realigning our parent cost to make sure that we're better serving our businesses and we're also lowering our cost structure. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Over the past several years you've had some movements in asset sales and divestitures as well. To what degree before this time have you focused on cost cuts at the corporate level? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Remember, going back in the 2015 to 2016 timeframe, we had an enterprise-wide initiative to create more value around our business model and I think across all of our utilities, across our non-utility businesses and parent, we took significant cost out of our business. Some of those initiatives are still ongoing at our utilities in 2018 and 2019, we called it our Fueling our Future initiative. You've heard us talk about in the past. What we're doing at corporate really is a phase two of that work and this is really intended to make sure that we right-size our cost as we reduce our asset base and our revenues related to the three divestitures that I cited. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful context. And then my second question is on the LNG announcements from today and I think two days ago. Could you give us a little bit more color on the competitive environment maybe what has changed if anything there over the past three to six months and give us a little bit color too on your decision to articulate a goal of 45 million tonnes per annum? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Sure. I actually appreciate that question a lot. I think as the new leadership team got together in May and June and we prepared for the analyst conference, we took the time we went to the World Gas Conference, I was joined by Joe Householder, and Joe, I'd like you to make some comments when I finish too, if you want to add some color and we took the opportunity to say where are we in terms of our competitive advantages geographically with respect to all five of the projects that we're pursuing, we took time to meet with a lot of different customers starting in Washington, D.C. I think we made the decision, Chris that we need to be a little bit more ambitious about what we think we can accomplish. And that was really driven by the customer interest we saw in our projects. So, I think one of the things that today's announcement from my standpoint, but I think the key takeaways are is that there's a lot of validation in the marketplace that we are very well competitively situated with our terminal down at ECA, as well as the two terminals we have in the Gulf Coast. So we've raised our ambitions and that's why as you think about our strategic goal of being North America's premier energy infrastructure company, we also want to be North America's premier infrastructure company in the LNG space. And that 45 million ton per annum figure was intended to reflect what we think that we can accomplish, and I'll give you a little bit more color in terms of why the Total MOU is so important. We took the time starting at the World Gas Conference to meet with Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Joe and I did. And I think when you look at the integrated natural gas space and all the competitors in the marketplace, they are currently the number two publicly-traded LNG player. But I think their ambition from equity gas in the ground through service to customers, and they've circled the goal of having 40 million tonnes per annum in their LNG portfolio by 2020, and then growing that portfolio at a 5% rate well into the future. What we felt like was that we matched their ambition in a small part of that value chain and namely that was making sure that we could turnkey some infrastructure here in the United States to support exports abroad. And that's why we were so interested in trying to match their ambition across the value chain really in an area where we thought that we had some unique expertise and really well-positioned geographic sites for liquefaction terminals. But, Joe, I appreciate if you will make some comments as well. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Sure. Thanks, Jeff, and hi, Chris. We've been engaged with Total since they made the announcement of buying the LNG business from Engie and I have been talking to them, and then we had the good fortune to meet with them at the World Gas Conference. And then Jeff and I met with them a number of times since, and he mentioned I was just in Asia with some of our LNG team and Faisel was along with us as well. But Jeff was busy with Carlos and others in Paris working on this. So we had a quite busy couple of weeks and a very busy weekend getting these things done. But I wanted to go to your point about competition. We have great partners and customers at Cameron and Total is now one of them, but also Mitsubishi and Mistui, and we're very pleased that Mistui is able to join us in the ECA project. I want to tell you there was a considerable competition for that project. We had a lot of people that wanted it and it was a little bit hard to explain to a couple of them that they were not going to be offtakers. We sold the thing out in these HOAs and having Mistui and Tokyo Gas and Total is very exciting for us. But I want you to know the competition was really high there and will continue to be high for the large scale project. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's really helpful. So it sounds like you guys are taking a step forward on the level of competition on the supply side here, but that also the demand remains pretty robust in terms of interest from prospective clients. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : I think that's accurate. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Chris, let me just add on to that because I mentioned and Jeff mentioned, I was in Asia for almost two weeks. The interest for our Port Arthur facility also is very robust. So we met with people in three countries and from the customers to the ministers and we have a lot of interest in all of our projects. And I think it speaks volume to our ability to execute across this frame and we've been talking about it for a while, but now we are in execution mode. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Appreciate that Joe. Thanks Jeff. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thanks, Chris. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Yes, hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. So first just, Jeff maybe in your strategic initiatives that you mentioned one of the things that I keep having people seem to get confused of is this board committee is called the LNG and Business Development Committee. But then none of these initiatives specifically talk about LNG. So could you just kind of clarify that issue since it seems like really on LNG you're mainly focused on just getting these growth projects done? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Yeah, Steve, I appreciate the question and we certainly appreciate you taking the time to come visit us here recently in San Diego. The way I would describe it is, we had an ad hoc committee of the board. Over the last several years it was really focused on meeting and making sure that we were galvanizing particularly the construction leadership from our board around making sure that the Cameron construction process went forward in a very healthy way. And as we went through resolving our thoughts and discussions with Elliott and folks, what we decided to do was rename that committee really around the business development review process. So that committee really has nothing to do \"with LNG\", it has everything to do with making sure that we take a comprehensive bottoms-up review of our entire business. There are no sacred cows. You've heard me say that before. If there are opportunities to drive more value to our customers and to our shareholders, that's exactly what you should expect us to do. So, the LNG portion of that title and I think you correctly point this out, is a little bit of a misnomer. It's really a legacy issue for the name of that original ad hoc committee. But this is intended to be a committee of the board that's focused exclusively on working with the management to make sure we look across the entire enterprise at ways that we can unlock value and strategy, will always be owned by our full board. But this is the committee that will iterate the process through February, where we've been making board decisions related to our strategy. And you should expect us to provide a fulsome update in the last week of March of all the five work streams I discussed at our analyst conference. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Okay. Great. And then, just on the HOA and MOU and the like, just from a standpoint of pricing and returns, I know you don't have official contracts yet, but just, should we read these as you're seeing sufficient pricing to get the returns you need on these projects? How can we think about that? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Steve, it's a great question. Obviously, the MOU \u2013 and we've taken some questions on this before \u2013 is intended to be a statement of aspiration about how we plan to collaborate with Total. That's a company that we hold in high regard. And there's more work to be done there as Joe indicated in his prepared remarks, about how we plan to maximize their participation not only in ECA 1 and 2, but also in Cameron Phase 2. We typically target low-double-digit unlevered returns on all of our LNG projects. I think Joe and I and others have talked about trying to guide across this portfolio where we're targeting roughly between 60% and 70% equity ownership. So, I think, the most important takeaway as you think about potential returns is the comment that Joe made particularly around ECA 1, Steve. The level of interest in the project was extremely high. We think that bodes well for ECA 2 but that also speaks directly to the point you're asking about is the pricing power and the expectation of how that might impact returns. But, Joe, if you want to add any other color to Steve's question? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : I think you answered it, Jeff. I think that getting these HOAs was a significant milestone for us. But there was a lot of competition. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Right. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Steve, so I think that answers your question. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then one last question just on Cameron 1-3, you mentioned you feel confident in the construction and schedule. Can you just maybe talk to maybe the other concern that that's out there is just the financial health of your E&C companies and just your protections from that? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Yeah, I'll make a couple comments, Steve, and pass it to Joe. But I think that we were thoughtful in the very beginning in terms of how we structure the contract. Joe talked about the lump sum nature of the EPC contract in his prepared remarks. Obviously, Chiyoda and now McDermott are jointly and severally liable to deliver that. We will not speak obviously to the financial health of those businesses directly, except to say we have a lot of confidence in both companies. Joe in particular has spent a lot of time with David Dickson, who is someone we enjoy spending time with. He certainly has a firm handle on that project. And I think the most important takeaway from our perspective is we continue to think that the project is on track with respect to what we've said in terms of having all three trains producing LNG next year and we don't really have any fundamental change in terms of how we think it's executed. But Joe, if you want to add some color, it would be helpful. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah, thanks, Jeff. Hi, Steve. I think that the big takeaway is, look, they just confirmed their plan to have all three trains producing LNG next year. And I have confidence in their ability to execute on that schedule. And I think that McDermott has made a number of positive changes in the oversight and management of the job site and at corporate. And we all, including the Cameron LNG team, the partners, we've all spent time with David Dickson and several of his team members over the past several months, the past six months I'd say since they had the merger completed with CBI (sic) [CB&I] (29:38). And they have a very high level of engagement and analysis about what it takes to finish this job. And I've personally met with David a number of times, he's very engaged and he's committed, he's focused. He knows he has a tough job ahead of them and they've accepted that in their merger. But you can see from his comments that he's focused on getting it done. And the contractual payment terms are drawn around ways for them to get cash flow as they hit milestones. So they're encouraged to keep pushing ahead. And the sooner they finish their work the sooner they get paid and the sooner they cut out their indirect and overhead costs. And I think if you looked at McDermott's announcements recently, they've talked about raising the funds they needed and have liquidity to finish the job on their side. So I feel good about their ability to do it. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey, good afternoon. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great list of accomplishments this quarter. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I think you may have just answered the question but I just wanted to be clear on follow up with regard to ECA Phase 1. You obviously own a majority stake in the IEnova, IEnova owns ECA, is it IEnova's intention to retain 100% equity stake in this project or would Mistui, Tokyo Gas, Total all be taking equity stakes in the project itself as well? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : It's a great question, Greg. You recall that using Cameron as a model, we have roughly a 51% ownership stake in Cameron. And Joe talked about this earlier as well, where we're targeting across this portfolio of 45 million tonnes per annum, owning between a 60% and 70% stake on average across the portfolio. Our approach to Cameron 1 will be targeting probably something that looks very close to a 50-50 equity ownership, for ECA 1 I mean, between IEnova and Sempra. And we're still having ongoing discussions about the level of participation that may or may not occur between the offtakers. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So IEnova \u2013 if I assume IEnova owns 50%, Sempra Corporation owns 50% because you functionally own a majority of IEnova, you own a proportionately higher direct and indirect stake in the project then, correct? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : That's correct. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. I just wanted to be clear on that. Thank you. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : My second question is with regard to the CapEx increase at TXU and I know in March you'll give a full five-year update on your financing plan. But is it your expectation that sort of the overall corporate balance sheet has the capacity to fund the equity investment needed to grow at that rate at TXU without additional equity issuance at the parent? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Greg, I really appreciate that question. I think that I'll start by just telling you how darn excited we are about the Oncor investment, right. You recall about this time last year they were heading into finalizing their rate case and had committed to a minimum capital expenditures over five years of $7.5 billion, and by the time we got to closing earlier this year in March we were able to adjust that CapEx forecast to $8.4 billion. So we're very pleased now to be able to put a firm number around their five year revised forecast of $10.5 billion. And that obviously does not include the expected CapEx that would come from purchase in InfraREIT as well to extend that franchise. So I think that the growth that we're seeing is both on the population side and on economic expansion and I certainly believe that we can meet the requirements of this over the next five years without equity issuances. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Fantastic. Take care, guys. See you soon. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Greg. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead, Julien. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, Jeff. Congratulations to the whole team on these LNG developments. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you very much. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Absolutely. Just following up on some of the last questions \u2013 particularly Steve's, how do you think about the mix with respect to Total's commitment here and just the timeline as well, right? So ECA, and especially the ECA expansion, certainly that had some other considerations on timeline given the import contract. How do you think about juggling these various considerations, especially given the 9 Mtpa committed. I mean, maybe said differently and more directly, you've got Total involved in the first phase of ECA. How imminent are we looking at an ECA expansion decision here, given what seemed like pretty material volumes, both with respect to the ECA expansion and Cameron 4, 5? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Well, as you ask that question, Julien, you can tell it's kind of a high-class problem, right? And we've got a lot of activity going on. I think it's particularly not only in our divestitures, but the acquisition in Texas. It's very important, and one of the things we spend a lot of time on is making sure that we have a very disciplined approach to execution. So, right out of the box, the most important thing is the careful disciplined delivery of Cameron Phase 1, right? So, all hands on deck to make sure we stick to the timeline of ensuring that we get LNG produced at all three trains in 2019. Next steps in terms of ECA 1 is to move from these HOAs, which, by the way, have relatively definitive terms that we expect to crystallize into sales and purchase agreements early in the spring, and that will be a critical step, as you look to try to reach FID at the end of2019 on ECA 1. And I think one of the things that Joe and Carlos and the overall marketing team are looking at now is we have a variety of campaigns around not only ECA Phase 2 and the marketing program there but also Port Arthur. So those conversations are underway and that's something that we'll be looking to update you on as we have more details in the coming month. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Maybe to clarify this. How much flexibility does Total have in the initial rate in that you all have committed with them on basically balancing ECA Phase 2 versus, say, Cameron 4, 5? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : The way I would describe it is if you just look at kind of what Total's announcements have come out, in 2017 they finished the year with roughly 60 million tonnes per annum in their overall LNG portfolio and they've targeted 40 million tonnes per annum publicly by 2020, right? So they have a pretty ambitious program underway. And I think they have long been focused on Cameron expansion even when they did the Engie acquisition they were quite public about their commitment not only to be in that project but also to sponsor the Phase 2 of Cameron. So I think what you've seen is you've seen them take down 0.8 Mtpa today in the HOA announcement at ECA Phase 1 and you've seen that they've circled an aspiration around a total of nine and it's reasonable to believe that that could be up to 4 million tonnes per annum at Cameron Phase 2 and up to potentially 4 million tonnes per annum at ECA Phase 2. So there's a lot more work to be done there but I think most importantly we share their ambition, Julien. I think we have a great working relationship at the senior level of both companies. I think the working engagement today around Cameron has been extremely healthy and that's one of the reasons we've got a lot of aspiration for the relationship. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : A quick clarification, if I can, on the Cameron Phase 2, is this to be assumed to be the leading project in the U.S. now relative to Port Arthur and that marketing efforts are going to be focused on this then, just given the greater involvement of Total now? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : What I'll do is I'll make a comment and I'll pass it to Joe, but I will tell you that it probably remains to be seen. I mean, there are people in the marketplace, Julien, that really want to privilege the competitive advantage of brownfield sites like we have at ECA, and like we have at Cameron. But one of the benefits we have at Port Arthur is we've done a lot of design engineering work going back to over the last several years. We think we have a very low cost project there. It's in a unique location in Beaumont. And I think that we've got an opportunity to do all of these. That's one of the reasons we've really changed our vision, our ambition of what we want to accomplish. So I don't want to make it sound like that we're going to prioritize Cameron Phase 2 over Port Arthur. There is a lot of interest as Joe indicated in both of these projects. And I'll pass it to Joe, if he'll make some comments on that. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Please. Thank you, Jeff. Hey, Julien. Look, they are different customers. So we don't have to prioritize one over the other. Total is very seriously interested in Cameron as are we. And we're working with our other partners evaluating what exactly is the best thing to do there. But that project is really a project where existing equity owners and customers are going to take the offtake from that facility. And now we're approaching a phase in the original construction that we can see. We can see to the end now and we can see when we could start doing something about expansion. But that one is focused on the existing customer base there. Port Arthur, I can tell you, I've just mentioned this earlier, I think to Chris is, the people that I spoke to in Asia, people that Jeff spoke to in Europe, others in Europe, they're very interested in Port Arthur because Port Arthur can equally go to both Europe and Asia And so, that one is something that I think will attract a lot of attention because of what Jeff talked about in terms of the cost. It's going to be very cost competitive. Cameron's a different situation. And so I wouldn't link those two together in terms of competition. And one comment about Phase 2 of the ECA project, I think we could probably try to move that forward very fast but we have something which I've talked to you about before which is we have an existing project there that's making $150 million a year. And we don't want to give away that. So we have to balance that. But depending on how fast the offtakers want to take it and what size can be, we'll have to look at that but I would say all three are moving ahead in a very nice way. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Congratulations again. Talk to you soon. Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Thanks. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Julien. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, congrats on a good earnings season. One question... Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ...you made the comments about kind of the broader strategic review and then you touched on the Latin American businesses. Can you talk just a little bit more, clarify kind of how you're going through the process of looking at those businesses? How you think about what's core versus maybe non-core to Sempra. And then and this may be a Trevor question kind of with all the asset sales and some of the other moving parts, what's your tax position? Meaning if you were to sell these at a sizable gain and you've owned them for a long time, how should we think about what it means from a cash tax perspective? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : So, Michael, I appreciate the question. I think I would harken back to the June analyst conference where we laid out that one slide that talked about how we thought about capital rotation and strategy and it was a very clear three-phase process. So, this year, we made a decision about how we could high grade the U.S.-based portfolio and focus more on T&D businesses both in utilities and outside the utilities. We talked about Phase 2 would be a deep dive on South America. Phase 2 is a Q1 2019 report. And then we talked about the reasoning why we would revisit IEnova and LNG in Q1 of 2020 because we want to make sure that, number one, Cameron is fully online and we're balancing, making sure that as we go through this capital rotation process we're doing it through the lens of making sure we maintain a strong credit position. So we have a very disciplined phased approach. This year it's divestitures. Next year, it's the Latin American review or, frankly, it's the South American review not Latin America. And then in 2020, we're going to update you on the IEnova, LNG story. And as you've seen in today's call, IEnova and LNG are greatly intertwined on ECA Phase 1 and ECA Phase 2 and that's why it's a second order analysis. Now, let me drop down to your specific question on South America. The lens we'll be looking through is just as we described it last June. If there's an opportunity to do something different with those businesses that have traceable benefits to our shareholders, you should expect us to follow that path. Now, this is something we've looked at multiple times historically and particularly the tax lens has been the greatest challenge. Now, as you know over the last nine months, you've seen a dramatic change in terms of how we reform U.S. taxes. But when we talk about was the change in control of tax provisions both in Peru and Chile that have tend to create a significant amount of leakage in excess of a $1 billion if you do transact down there. So the lens that Dennis Arriola, who's leading that effort, is reviewing what this is, number one, we're going to put it through the lens of earnings impact and accretion. Taxes will be a consideration as well as credit. And we always try to look at it, Michael, from the lens of, are these businesses more valuable to somebody else. So one of the inherent questions is what might be different this time when you look at it? Well, asset values in South America have certainly traded up, the interest rate environment is a consideration, the change in taxes here in the United States and our NOL position is a consideration. So what our commitment is, is to go back and look at it de novo with a fresh review bottoms-up and if we can create more value in some type of rotational opportunity, we will. We're going to go through exactly what I said in our prepared remarks. Does it make the most sense to hold and grow those businesses, partner either in South America or at the holding company in the Netherlands or to sell those businesses? So that's the thought process. And then I'll turn to Trevor to see if he'll add anything from an overall tax standpoint. Trevor Ian Mihalik - Sempra Energy : No, Jeff, I think you covered it pretty well. There is \u2013 even though we have an NOL position in the U.S., as Jeff said, there's local taxes that need to be taken into consideration and the indirect sales rules that also need to be contemplated if there were to be a sale down there. And so, you need to take a look at all of that across the board to determine what the cash tax payment implications are and that's why we try to disclose that at the analyst conference. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it guys. Thanks much appreciated, Jeff, Trevor. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Michael. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hey. How you doing? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Great. How you doing, Paul? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : All right. So I think I've been LNG'd-out here. So just back on Oncor, are all these \u2013 are these projects subject to, I mean they sound perfectly legitimate and everything, but just in general, is there any regulatory approval process for them or is it sort of formula driven? Or how do we think about that and how is the cost allocation? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Thank you for asking that question. You'll recall that in Texas they have a T-cost mechanism which is the mechanism by which you look at use and useful type of projects that you identify. They'll make investments in distribution and transmission. And all of those are reviewed in hindsight at the next rate case. But these are all driven by demand that they are seeing on their system, and I think one of the things that Allen (45:42) and the team are quite proud about is they've never had $1 of disallowance in the history of that company. So they're quite prudent in terms of how they allocate capital. And I think one of the things you're seeing here is they've got a real focus on not only being the lowest cost provider in the state of Texas today, but they're also making sure that all the capital that they allocate, Paul, is prudently used knowing that at some point in the future, it'll be reviewed as part of a rate case. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. And then, there were some rate design concerns that sort of had shown up this summer at San Diego that had caused some concern. And I know you guys were looking to address them and what have you, and I just wondering if you could update us in terms of how you think that's looking in terms of getting that sort of corrected. And then just also, in terms of the wildfires, one of your utilities is voicing concern \u2013 or one of your neighboring utilities, I'm sorry, is voicing concern about higher risks associated with wildfire and, therefore, planning on asking for a higher return in terms of cost of capital. And I'm just wondering if you guys were thinking of doing the same thing with the upcoming cost of capital proceeding. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Hey. Sure I'd be glad to try to address both of those questions. The first of which is on rate design; the second is on the potential impact of cost of capital. I'll see if Joe wants to kind of come behind me with any other comments. But let's start and talk about rate design. You remember that over the last three to five years, we've had a number of different rate initiatives around rooftop solar and the redesign of the rates around, not just a three-tiered rate schedule, Paul, which is volumetric, but also a super user rate. And the design of this is that your fixed costs are collected volumetrically. And essentially, as you use more electricity in the San Diego system, much like the rest of the state \u2013 the other utilities have a similar mechanism \u2013 you actually cover a larger portion of the fixed cost for the utility. I think one of the things we've long advocated for is that whether you're a rooftop solar user, whether you're completely off the grid with some sporadic or intermittent use of the utility, there is a design model where costs are best spread evenly across customers and then a lot of dialogue around a fixed charge. We have a fixed charge at SoCalGas. I think there's a fixed charge at over 60 different utilities across the state of California. So both SCG&E (48:17), PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric have long thought that a portion of their fixed costs should be collected that way. But the current rate design has a three-phase approach with the super-user rate and that's something that will continue to be part of the design discussion at the Commission. Secondly, on cost of capital, I think you've hit a really, really important point which is, it's intended to be a proxy of what we in the market believe is the appropriate return for all stakeholders. So as you look at both the interest rate environment, you look at inherent operating risk in your service territory. As we go into that cost of capital review, we will be approaching that in an April filing which is intended to reflect what we think the appropriate return is for the unique operating characteristics of our own service territories. Joe, do you want to add any comments to either of those? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : No. I think you addressed it. Let's see if there's another question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Well, just I mean, just as a sort of a follow-up there. So should we expect \u2013 I mean, how are you guys thinking about the risk profile? I mean, I know that you guys were relatively unscathed compared to others in the most recent fire seasons, but just in general, we should expect you guys going in and probably expecting a higher? I mean, how should we think about it in terms of your current cost of capital that you guys settled on recently? Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy : Yeah. Sure. Paul, this is Joe. I'll just add on to it. I mean, we got asked the question a little bit earlier about the FERC ROEs and we certainly asked for 100 basis points additional there which takes into account existing situation with wildfires of course. And the FERC rate base is about $4 billion, a significant part of our rate base. So we will be looking to do the same with the CPUC ROE, taking into account many factors. Interest rates going up, the wildfire exposure. Of course, in our situation, we have spent a significant amount of money over the past 10 years really mitigating a lot of that risk and continue to do that every day. Our goal is to reduce that risk to the most minimal amount we can. But we have to take into account all those risk premiums. So I think we will be looking forward to making a filing with a higher ROE. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, just finally with the \u2013 back to the rate design, should we think that next summer, when it comes around the situation, that developed this summer is unlikely to happen again? I mean, with your discussions with the Commission and what have you, that they're sort of open to the idea of changing this, that they're also finding this to be sort of an issue? Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : I'll make a couple of comments. One is, I think there are many stakeholders in the process, Paul, that believe that, from a environmental standpoint, the people that use the most should be burdened the most. And the rate design is intended to make sure that the more electricity you use, the higher amount of fixed cost that you bear. I think what happens in the summer time is it becomes more extreme. So what people are looking at is ways that you can make sure that you can have a rational rate design where people are paying their fair share for system cost as well as their fair share of electricity cost. And this is not a recent phenomenon. This is an ongoing debate over the last decade. And I think what you should count on is there are many people in the process now that believe that we can move to a more modern design where folks that are incentivized to use rooftop solar are rewarded for that. But at the same time, there's a more common fee associated with people that are connected to the grid. So I can't promise you that it'll be resolved by next summer. I can say there are a lot of people very engaged in this process. And over the next several years, my instinct is, you'll see an evolution in rate design. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : Thank you, Paul. Operator : And at this time, I will turn the program to Jeff Martin for any closing or further comments. Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy : So let me close by saying that we very much appreciate everyone's participation on today's call. We're very pleased with the strong operating results we posted for the quarter and the great progress we've seen from our LNG team. Thank you, again, for joining us. If you have any follow up questions, feel free to contact the IR team and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Faisel Khan : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President and Group President; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. Before starting, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we\u2019ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. I\u2019d also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2019, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot, Faisel. And thank you all for joining us today. 2018 was an exceptional year for Sempra both operationally and financially. It was also a transformative year marking our company's 20th anniversary and the continuation of our strategic mission to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day last June, since our formation, we\u2019ve proactively managed our business portfolio. Over the years this has greatly improved our earnings and cash flow visibility while bolstering a lower risk profile.  Importantly, our recent accomplishments have laid a solid foundation for us to build on and include completing the Oncor transaction, closing the sale of our US solar business, closing the sale of our natural gas storage assets, announcing the sale of our US wind business, announcing Oncor\u2019s InfraREIT acquisition, announcing the sale of the South American businesses and making very important progress on our LNG projects, among other successes.  Over the last 12 months, we've accomplished a tremendous amount. The amounts of activity we've had is uncommon and even more uncommon are the results. I cannot be more proud of our team and what we've done to improve our portfolio. Notably, we expect our renewables and midstream divestitures to yield approximately $2.5 billion in proceeds. This is an excellent result and provides a valuable opportunity to pay down debt and redeploy capital to support our growth  I also want to highlight that this past year SDG&E received the prestigious Edison award from EEI for its efforts to enhance wildfire preparedness and grid resiliency. This award is presented to only one US investor-owned utility each year. At Cameron LNG we have entered the critical commissioning phase of construction and also have an excellent safety record with over 67 million hours worked without a lost time incident.  Additionally, we were recently added to the Dow Jones Utility Index, a strong testament to the continued focus on execution and commitment to delivering shareholder value. Now, turning to our financial results, earlier this morning we reported full year 2018 adjusted earnings of $5.57 per share, one of the strongest years in our company's history. This puts us above the midpoint of our full year 2018 adjusted earnings guidance.  In addition, our Board approved a dividend increase of 8% for 2019. This marks the ninth consecutive year we've raised our dividend and represents 47% growth over the last five years. This is important for a number of reasons because it clearly demonstrates our commitment to a healthy dividend policy. I'm also pleased to say that we\u2019re affirming our full year 2019 adjusted earnings guidance of $5.70 to $6.30 per share. Trevor will review the key drivers influencing guidance later on the call.  I\u2019d also like to spend a few minutes on California.  Earlier this month, we filed our Wildfire Mitigation Plan related to Senate Bill 901. This file is a continuation of our ongoing focus on safety, reliability and wildfire prevention that we\u2019ve been implementing for over a decade. And during this time, we've invested about $1.5 billion in these efforts.  Regarding the State's efforts to reduce wildfire threats and their potential impacts, we are very encouraged by recent statements by the governor and as well as the formation of the Blue Ribbon Commission and the Governor Strike Team. There is widespread recognition among the Governor, Legislature, Utility Commission that the current liability rules for California utilities need to be fixed to support a long-term solution for the state and to allow it to meet the State\u2019s energy policy goals.  To be clear, these goals cannot be that without strong financially healthy utilities that support the infrastructure investments needed to deliver cleaner and lower cost energy solutions. We anticipate solutions being brought forward will fall into three key categories. First, help reduce the threat of wildfires across our State. Second protect the interests of our State\u2019s rate payers. And third, provide a clear legislative pathway for timely and adequate cost recovery for prudent system operators. These potential outcomes will help create a longer-term sustainable framework for the State and its energy future.  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take a moment to recognize Martha Wyrsch. Martha will be retiring at the beginning of the March. On behalf of everyone here at Sempra I wanted to thank Martha for her tremendous contributions to the company. We wish Martha and her family all the best in retirement.  Now, please turn to Slide 5, and I'll hand it over to Trevor. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff mentioned, we accomplished a lot in 2018 making great progress to refocus our efforts on the strategic mission to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company.  Additionally, with two months of 2019 behind us, we\u2019ve already announced the completion of the evaluation of the South American businesses. Bank of America and Lazard will act as our financial advisors and will begin the sales process in March. We\u2019ve also started implementing the next round of continuous cost improvement initiatives, which I'll touch on in a few minutes.  All of these developments demonstrate this management's theme to focus on execution and commitment to creating shareholder value. Please turn to the next slide. The decision to sell the South American businesses was not something we, nor our Board, took lightly. The six-month evaluation process was comprehensive. The primary criteria we looked at are laid out in the slide. Both businesses screened well in many areas but we concluded that they no longer remain a strategic fit for us. As part of this evaluation we assessed the benefits and rationale for holding and growing or partnering and growing. However, we determined the sale of these businesses and redeployment of the proceeds into North American infrastructure should maximize value for our shareholders while giving us the opportunity to strengthen our balance sheet while paying down parent debt.  There is no doubt that the South American businesses are considered some of the most desirable companies in the region with strong company-specific and macro fundamentals. We certainly have received robust inquiry from global financial and strategic buyers ahead of our formal sales process commencing.  Although, we expect this transaction to be EPS dilutive, it could be value accretive, as we deploy the proceeds into North American T&D infrastructure and strengthen our balance sheet. Portfolio optimization is not something new to our company, and we've talked about this many times over the years. We have a long and successful track record of actively managing our portfolio, including exiting businesses that are either no longer consistent with our strategy, or provide greater long-term value through selling rather than holding. A great example of this is the sale of our US solar assets late last year.  The decision to sell the South American businesses is a continuation of this philosophy and demonstrates our commitment to maximizing value for our shareholders. We're targeting a transaction announcement in mid-2019 and closing the transaction by the end of this year. Please turn to Slide 7, where I'll review our efforts around cost improvement initiatives. At our Analyst Day in June last year, you'll recall that Jeff walked through the evolution of our business portfolio, illustrating how our management team is continuously reassessing our strategy and business platforms, and how they fit with changing market environments.  In direct alignment with this portfolio of review process, we're always refining and reevaluating our cost structure, in order to optimize the organization to effectively accomplish our strategic goals. Sempra has a history of being a prudent cost manager. We make thoughtful and deliberate efforts to reduce costs in ways that make our organization efficient, but also very effective. Our continuous cost improvement process is designed to yield long-term savings and instill a cost conscious culture across the organization. A great example of this is the $65 million of annual savings identified a few years ago at our California utilities that was incorporated into the 2019 GRC filings. These savings should benefit our customers, by allowing us to allocate these dollars to continued infrastructure investments in safety and reliability. Recently, we've initiated further efforts around continuous cost improvements, designed to right size our organization with our evolving business portfolio. The announced sale of our assets and other efficiencies will allow us to reduce our corporate costs. We expect these cost savings to ramp up to approximately $15 million annually on a pre-tax basis, over the next few years. Our management team is committed to reviewing our cost on a regular basis to ensure we run an organization as effectively and as efficiently as possible. Now please turn to Slide 8, where I'll hand the call off to Joe. Joe Householder : Thanks, Trevor. First, I'd like to briefly touch on the IEnova in Mexico. Mexico is the world's 15th largest economy at over $1 trillion in GDP, with nearly 130 million people. The infrastructure needs of the country are expected to remain significant. For example, only 7% of the households have access to natural gas. And residential electricity demand is expected to double by 2040. For more than two decades IEnova has remained focused on developing energy infrastructure that promotes economic development in a sustainable and socially responsible way. IEnova is working with the private sector on additional opportunities that should benefit the country, such as, refined product terminals that should enhance Mexico's energy security and the reliability of transportation fuel supplies; renewable projects that should increase Mexico's clean energy supply and be a source of efficient, low-cost electricity, and the conversion of Energia Costa Azul project to an LNG export project that should bring additional regional investment, economic development and jobs. As IEnova mentioned on their call late last week, they\u2019re proactively engaged in discussions with the current administration, related to natural gas transportation contracts that were awarded through public and international tender processes. IEnova has always had a very constructive relationship with the Mexican Government and its institutions. The company that is committed to being a responsible partner, IEnova looks forward to working collaboratively to advance the country's energy goals and build out the infrastructure needed to provide clean, safe, reliable and low cost energy. Please turn to the next slide. Moving onto Cameron. The onsite teams are relentlessly focused on moving through commissioning towards completion of Train 1. The contractor has made significant progress recently with the completion of the gas turbine testing, commissioning of the boil-off gas compressors, introduction of fuel gas into the system and completion of all three flares ignition testing. In the near term, the contractor expects to introduce speed gas sometime this quarter and it also expects to produce LNG stabilized production and complete performance testing in the second quarter. With that said, we expect to start receiving earnings by mid 2019. This first phase of construction, which includes Train 1 and the associated support systems, as well as the common infrastructure that will be used by all three Trains represents approximately 60% of the entire project. After many years of development and construction, all the employees involved, as well as the community are excited, that the facility will soon be up and running, further boosting the local economy, while also helping to meet global energy demand. As you may have heard on McDermott's call yesterday, the same teams are working hard toward completion of Trains 2 and 3. McDermott reported that Train 2 is targeted to be completed by the end of Q4 and Train 3 is targeted to be completed by the end of Q1 2020. This schedule is consistent with what was disclosed on their Q3 2018 call. Please turn to the next slide, where Trevor will review our financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Joe. Earlier this morning we reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $864 million or $3.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter earnings were $431 million or $1.56 per share. Full year 2018 GAAP earnings were $924 million or $3.42 per share. This compares to 2017 GAAP earnings of $256 million or $1.01 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2018 earnings were $1,503 million or $5.57 per share. This compares favorably to our 2017 adjusted earnings of $1,368 million or $5.42 per share. Please turn to Slide 11, where I'll discuss the key drivers impacting our full year 2018 results. The year-over-year increase in full year adjusted earnings was driven primarily by higher operational earnings in 2018, including $371 million of earnings at the Sempra Texas Utility segment, resulting from the acquisition of our interest in Oncor in March of 2018. $65 million of higher earnings at SDG&E, primarily due to electric transmission operations, $25 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico, mainly driven by higher pipeline operational earnings, and $16 million of higher earnings at SoCalGas, due to higher PSEP earnings. This was partially offset by $310 million of higher costs related to increased interest expense and preferred stock dividends at the parent, which includes the impact of our Oncor acquisition financing. And $21 million unfavorable impact from the foreign currency and inflation effects, net of foreign currency hedges in Mexico. Please turn to the next slide. Several significant business developments since our last Analyst conference, we thought it would be helpful to provide a brief walk through of the key items related to our affirmation of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. First, we removed the earnings associated with the US renewables and nonutility natural gas storage assets, subsequent to their respective sale close dates. Second, we added partial year earnings from Oncor's planned acquisition of InfraREIT and our planned acquisition of a 50% equity interest in Sharyland. And third, we added the positive impacts from using the expected $2.5 billion of proceeds from the sale of solar, wind and natural gas storage. When taking these items into account, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.70 to $6.30 that was presented at the Analyst Conference last year. This is a strong outcome, given the significant activity within our business portfolio. Please turn to Slide 13. As we turn our attention to the rest of 2019, we'll continue to focus on the positive momentum we've developed over the past year. We've identified several goals to progress on our strategic mission to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. They include among others, continuing to focus every day on public and employee safety as a cultural imperative, optimizing and completing the remaining asset divestitures, optimizing cost structures, improving the franchise value of our LNG business by progressing on our five development projects, completing Oncor's InfraREIT acquisition and executing on their growth initiatives in Texas, and advancing our 2019 General Rate Case and cost of capital filings at the California utilities among others. Please turn to the next slide. As I stated at the beginning of my comments, we are very proud of the great strides we've made in the many accomplishments in 2018. We delivered strong financial results and our company is aligned for the future. We look forward to continuing this progress and feel prepared to meet the challenges and capture strategic opportunities that lie ahead. Looking to next month, we are excited to host many of you in San Diego for our analyst conference. We will cover several topics including detailed segment guidance for 2019 and 2020, the five year capital plan and rate base growth for our three US utilities, our growth outlook in Mexico and an update on the progress of our approximately 45 Mtpa of LNG development opportunities. We'll also be hosting a tour of our industry leading weather center at SDG&E and highlighting some of the innovative technologies around safety, reliability and resiliency that we've deployed on our systems. With that, we'll conclude the prepared comments and start to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our question from Greg Gordon. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Greg Gordon : A couple of questions. Great year. I'm just wondering if you can go into a little bit more detail on how you were able to exceed the high end of the guidance range of the utilities for fiscal year '18? And how do we think about how that sets the stage for going forward? Jeff Martin : Greg. Thank you for the question and thanks for joining the call. I think for those of you have followed our company for a long period of time, certainly SoCalGas and the SDG&E are kind of the clear drivers underpinning our financial performance. I think you can see that year-over-year there was a lot of growth, particularly at SDG&E, and one of the slides kind of points out some of that oversize growth particularly around the FERC business, which is really a function of increased capital investments in and around our high voltage system and our substations, as well as a periodic for true-up which occurs, which was also helped to last year's results. I'd just like to ask, Trevor, if you like to add any other content around SoCalGas or SDG&E? Trevor Mihalik : Yes. No, thanks, Jeff. I think also one of the things that the utilities are focused on are cost savings and certainly driving cost efficiencies in their businesses. But again, I think it's really just great operational results that have driven these earnings. Greg Gordon : Great. And I know there's been -- there has been and will probably continue to be a lot of volatility around the peso, and I think the assumption you are using is your baseline is a bit higher than where the peso is today. So how should we think about how that sort of friction inside the guidance range? Trevor Mihalik : Yes. I think what I would do is refer you to the rule of thumb that we have in the appendix of the deck, and it shows kind of where we are assuming the peso will go by the end of the year and then it has that plus or minus 5%. I think if you look at that, given where the peso was last year and how we absorbed the peso strengthening in our earnings and we're still well within our guidance, I would just kind of direct you to that and I think there's enough other things that we're working on that could offset a strengthening peso. Greg Gordon : Okay. I mean just to keep it high levels, if I start at the midpoint, that should and then flex from their I'd be -- as we go through the year looking at a reasonable approximation of how the peso is affecting your outcomes? Jeff Martin : I would just say I think that's the right approach. But I think as we've seen in the past Greg, the peso will continue to demonstrate some volatility. I think our goal is to make sure that when we put earnings out there and guidance that we can deliver that. I think the point Trevor was making is we've got enough levers in our portfolio that we will adequately follow the pace up. I think that we feel good -- very good about our 2019 range. Greg Gordon : Okay. Final question from me. Despite the progress that you've demonstrated at Cameron, there is still this lingering fear out there in the Ether that that somehow this project is either still going to come on late, even though we're toward the back-end of the construction process, or that there is some way that there is incremental financial remuneration that you may have to give to the joint venture constructing the project to get this thing done. When do we pass the point of no return where those lingering fears that sort of definitively behind us from your perspective? Jeff Martin : Greg, I think it's a great question. I can assure you that we remain concerned. I think that's how you manage because projects has be on top of these types of things. I would comment that Joe has done a remarkable job with his team, and worked with our partners on the Cameron build out. Also I think if you listen McDermott's call yesterday, they have been quite clear. But what they believe they can deliver and we will remain active with our partners and managing that relationship against the commissioning timeline. Joe could you provide some additional color on your conversations with David and how you're approaching it? Joe Householder : Thanks, Jeff. I think you'd handled that well. But Greg, look together at Sempra and our partners and our customers we're very excited about the impending start-up at Cameron. And we're all focused on finishing the commissioning of Train 1 and continuing to work on Train 2 and 3. And I talked to David quite often and Jeff just mentioned, he was very strong about his desire to complete this world-class facility and their stocks doing very well today. And we're working hard toward continuing to push forward. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe. Steve Fleishman : Great. So just Jeff question on California. So obviously, you've done a good job making -- avoiding fires, invested a lot for your system, but there's still, I think a lot of outside concerned of just as California done enough to limit risk for the companies and credit agencies putting pressure on you too. So I'm just kind of curious what you -- from your standpoint as someone who is not had a fire recently, just what you really want the state to do to help address this concern? What are you advocating for? Jeff Martin : Okay. Well, I appreciate you making the comment that we haven't had a fire for a while, it's been since 2007, and I think if there has been anything that's allowed us to create kind of a competitive advantage to protect our rate payers it's experience we went through in 2007, and how hard we've worked to basically build a system. I think that provides a lot of leadership on behalf of our customers, but I talked about this a little bit Steve in my prepared remarks. But here some additional color. I think that we've been in close contact, as you would expect with all the key stakeholders. In fact, we are hosting a lot of key stakeholders from across the state, including members of the Governor staff, here in our building tomorrow, to continue to advance what we think the appropriate actions are. And I would also complement the Governor, I think he's walked into a tough situation with strikes in the LA Unified School District and obviously a lot of the legacy issues in and around the fire areas. And he has pushed forward the Blue Ribbon panel. He's pushed forward to strike force, there's a lot of conversation from the Governor\u2019s Office about trying to deliver results from both of those organizations, earlier in the legislative process rather than later. On the specifics of what needs to happen, I'm going to be very clear from Sempra's perspective, we do not think a strict liability standard is the appropriate standard for investor-owned utilities. But probably what's most important in our advocacy is to make sure that we always frame our discussions around what's best for ratepayers. I mean, that really is the fundamental issue in our service model and secondly that whatever the outcomes are, either from a regulatory path or a legislative path, there is a very clear and defined pathway for timely and adequate cost recovery for utilities that operates our system prudently. We filed our wildfire mitigation plan earlier this year. It is really kind of a 4 point plan that really focuses, number one, on fire hardening. Number two on vegetation management. I think we have a world-class vegetation management program and our filing attempts to double the frequency, which we term our trees in our service territory. We're going to add to our aerial assets I think we've led the nation in terms of the type of helicopter support, we've had on station and if someone used to fly helicopters, the Utopian goal is to have a 24 hour capability and part of our filing gives us the ability to operate at night time, which will be another competitive advantage, as you try to fight buyers at one starts. And then lastly, the fourth part of that plan is we are going to double down our weather stations. I think we unified over 60 different weather stations that we're trying to enhance, so that not only -- so we can really extend our fire science advantage in terms of how we predict whether. But bottom line is, I think there's a lot of different ways to come at this. I'm pleased with the leadership is being shown from the Governor\u2019s Office. And I think that the whole goal here is to create a more sustainable and a more fair framework for everyone that's involved in the system. Steve Fleishman : Okay. That's very helpful. One other question, just on the Mexico. The news from two weeks ago on what the government might want to do with the force majeure situation. Was there any better clarity just on that specific issue or is it still added more of a high-level right now? Jeff Martin : Yes, let me make a couple of comments here. I'll pass it to Joe for some details around the actions relative to that pipeline. I think it might be helpful too for Dennis to talk about what the United States government is doing to support the key nature of Mexico as a partner, particularly around natural gas. But what I'll try to do Steve is remind people that we've been invested in Mexico for over 20 years. We're not a company that began invested in projects a year ago or two years ago. We have the leading Mexican energy company in the country. We're ranked in the top 50 on the Bolsa, obviously as you know it's headquartered in Mexico, we've got independent Mexican directors and its self-funded from local markets. And one of the things that we're trying to do is we have a long-term view about the opportunity around infrastructure in that country, and we believe that the infrastructure opportunity remains quite large Steve, and as the government continues to focus on expanding services to all the people of Mexico, their reliance on foreign direct investment will go up, it will not go down. And I think our value proposition, every time we are in front of stakeholders in Mexico is to really emphasize our role in bringing new and cleaner sources of energy to the country to help support the economy and give choice and lower cost energy to Mexican families. But on the specific issue of the pipeline, Joe in kind of steps that Carlos and Tania are taking. Do you want to provide additional color? Joe Householder : Thanks, Jeff. Hi, Steve. You mentioned a lot of the things that I wanted to mention that we are very focused on providing low cost energy into Mexico, and one of the things that you know Steve is really helpful is the feedstock of natural gas into the electricity market. And so obvious pipeline infrastructure is being built around that. The situation with the seven pipelines that they referred to the other day, was they were, as you mentioned in force majeure for various reasons. We are involved in two of those. In the Sonora pipeline, as you recall, we had that pipeline in operation, it was already earning revenues. So it's a little bit unlike all the other six which our pipelines haven't gone into service. In this case, it wasn't service and then there were sabotage and it was damaged, and we had to take it out of service, and we've been working with CFE. The administration is very focused on making sure that it's getting good value for money than spending. So it's actually an opportune time and Carlos and Tania have been in meeting with CFE, so a little bit unlike some other things that have been out in the press. We have been a first mover here to go in and meet with various members of various parts of the administration, have meetings with CFE and Tania is now -- she is the CEO. She is in charge of meeting with CFE to move this along, I think it gives us a great opportunity actually to get this pipeline fixed. If they could work with us, if the government can work with us to work with the local people that were involved in this, I think within weeks we could have that pipeline fixed and bringing cheap low cost gas into Mexico and I think that will resolve that problem. The other one that we're involved in is the marine pipeline that TransCanada and we are building, and that one's ready to go into service soon. We're just working on tying in. The thing is substantially done, but the offshore pipeline needs to get tied into the onshore pipeline and they are working on that now. There is some weather challenges, which means wave action that's keeping them from having the vessels tie up these things, but we're working on that should be done pretty soon. So that will also solve that second one. Dennis Arriola : Steve, this is Dennis. The other thing I'd add to Jeff and Steve's comments. First on the Sonora pipeline, I think it's important to remember that the auction process there was a competitive process that was run by CFE. The terms and conditions were dictated by CFE. And I think that was one of the things that our team in Mexico may refer to reiterate to the new CFE Director and to the President's administration that this was basically a very transparent and fair process. The other thing that I had mentioned to you is what we're doing in order to collaborate and support our people in Mexico. We've obviously continued to maintain close contact with the State Department, the Department of Energy, the Embassy folks in Mexico City to remind them not only of Sempra's investment in IEnova, but the importance of what this means to the United States. Remember that Mexico is the largest natural gas trading partner for the United States, and we have a trade surplus from an energy standpoint with Mexico. So making sure that we maintain fair and transparent rules in Mexico for the investments that we have there which are badly needed in the future, not only is good for Mexico, but it serves the interest of the United States and I can tell you that folks in Washington DC are supported by watching this closely. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about your dialog with the rating agencies with respect to risk mitigation in California, as Steve actually mentioned, I mean you have a very strong operational track record, you're a clearly leader in fire risk mitigation. A lot more of your system is underground than other utilities. Is that being recognized, are there real tangible steps in progress that you need to make to avoid ratings downgrades? Could you just give a little more color on that dialog? Please. Jeff Martin : I appreciate the question, Steve, and I think the answer -- in the short-form is, yes. I think, if you think about all the strategic initiatives we have a company of undertaken in the last two years, we have had very, very close contact with the rating agencies, because we've made it a priority to make sure we maintain an investment grade plus balance sheet and your point of differentiation is important and it does resonate with all three agencies. We have the best safety program. I mean, number one in the country and deserves a higher, not a lower credit rating. We make that point consistently. We have been aggressive about de-risking our service territory and de-risking our overall business model at Sempra and that's one of the reasons, you've seen the agencies move down their target FFO to debt metrics based upon our continued focus on T&D type of investments. Second, I think there is momentum, Stephen, in the state to correct the market. I made this comment earlier in my remarks and to insure ratepayers are protected, and if there are cost to be absorbed that there's timely recovery for those folks. I guess SDG&E, they are prudently managing their system. So I think the agencies are in a tough spot, right. I think this is largely been a rerating of the state, more so than individual companies, but it's our job to be in front of them, making sure that they understand that there is true differentiation and separate apart from how the rules change or how the laws change, the number one thing to do is to be a leader around how you run your system, when you cut your system off, how predictive you're about whether that impacts your system, and our goal and I think you can see this in our wildfire mitigation plans to take the current leadership we have an extend it based on the investments we're making. But I would say with respect SDG&E, independent of what actions the agencies taken, I think we're are going be quite aggressive in terms of defending our franchise. We have also taken steps to make sure we have ample liquidity at SDG&E. Stephen Byrd : Well, that's super helpful color. That actually that last part Jeff does touch on -- and a question we get often from investors just in the event that for any number of reasons the rating agencies do choose to downgrade, not just you but potentially other utilities in the state further. Obviously that's not good for customers in the sense of the cost of capital obviously goes up, cost of financing in the long run. But in the short run I guess the perspective is you do have quite a bit of liquidity, you are not facing fire liabilities, you haven't had a fire in 12 years. Could you maybe give a little more color just on sort of the short-term protections you have, liquidity et cetera you have just to sort of lay those near-term concerns? Jeff Martin : Yes, I'll have Trevor go ahead and talk through where we're at with our credit lines with SoCalGas and SDG&E and our ability to flex those lines. Trevor Mihalik : Yes, Steve. So we have a fairly large credit line at both utilities that we can draw down, and those are largely undrawn at the current time. And then we also have the ability to continue to issue secured bonds if needed, albeit at higher rates. But again, I think, our view on this is, we're continuing to defend the fact that we are differentiated in California. We had the rating agencies out, to come take a look at our fire mitigation plans and they recognize that we are differentiated. But again, from our perspective, the credit lines are $750 million at each of the utilities. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Good. Thank you very much. So I want to pick up where a couple of last questions are left off. First going back to the California policies, more broadly, I'd be curious if you could expand a little bit on the current state of legislative affairs and specifically comment a little bit around the funding or the prefunding potential here for the various IOUs. How do you guys think about that versus other solutions on the table. I know it's early days, we've got some draft legislation out there, but it seems to be going in a certain direction. I'm curious if you think that's really where it's going or if there's any other twist that we should be looking at more conceptually, not in terms of hard details here? Jeff Martin : I'll make some comments Julien and then I'll pass it to Dennis to fill in a couple more details. But now I think at a high level what I'm impressed by is that SB-901 call for this Blue Ribbon panel to be seeded. I think they've got a diverse group of folks that have their head down are working away on that initiative, that report out to the legislature is required by July 1, is my expectation based upon feedback that we've received. That they should be able to finish that work earlier, which I think would be helpful from the legislative process. The strike team that Governor's put together was intentionally designed, to bring in independent financial advisors, law firms, people that specialize really in issues around credit. So one of the things that we want to be very proactive is that people really understand the power of the fixed income markets and the importance of the credit ratings across this industry. The bottom line is, we believe, and I think the Governor shares our view based on conversations I've had, that the utilities this state deserve and need to have an A rated balance sheet. And that is the goal of the process that we're undertaking. So, there's a lot more work to be done. We're going to have a seat at the table. I think we're going to have an aggressive outreach. I've been personally involved to make sure that Sempra has a seat at the table to improve the overall risk-reward profile of both SoCalGas and SDG&E. So the process that the state is undergoing should be an opportunity for Sempra to have a seat at the table and by the end of the year have improved the franchise value of both of our utilities. I'll stop and see if Dennis wants to add any color. Dennis Arriola : No, I think, you hit on all the points, Jeff. The only thing I'd mention is, recall that the strike team that the governor is setup has various representatives whether it's chief or staff, people from the finance industry, the legal industry, folks from insurance. So I think it's multifaceted there are a lot of perspectives that are going to be presented in the roadmap and the recommendations to the Blue Ribbon commission, and then their job is going to be really to refine the plan to look at the recommendations of pros and cons of risks and how you can make sure that you can navigate through this process and make those recommendations to the governor and to the legislature by the end of June. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. Excellent. Then just quickly following up on some of the questions on '19 guidance specifically. First off, I know you guys talked about the $50 million pre-tax cost savings effort. Didn't see that specifically called out here. So just wanted to make sure, just from a timing perspective, how you see that ramping up, as you say over the next few years, but more specifically here? And then also with respect to the California GRC here, you mentioned the assumptions on attrition, certainly there is some early data points, shall we say, how does that figure into the plus-minus math that you show here on the right hand side of slide 12? Jeff Martin : Let me take a stab at that and if we see it needs more detail, I'll have Trevor jump on it. But I think we've circled to $50 million opportunity, around our corporate center. And we know exactly where those dollars are coming from. We expect to have full run rate of that $50 million, Julien, by the end of the year. This isn't a one-time event. I think you've heard us talk about this before good companies are always pursuing these type of cost savings, and that's why going back to some of Trevor's prepared remarks, we ran a program like this that our operating companies that in general, just over $65 million of savings at SDG&E and SoCalGas, and those dollars are currently in the rate case and this $50 million is incremental to that. But from time-to-time, we'll take questions on our former ones and so forth, and I was looking at some data recently where, as an example, Julien since 2013 just over five years ago SDG&E electric O&M per customer has decreased by 40%. So we've been able to reduce cost on per customer basis by 12% CAGR for five straight years, and that includes drop in 500 positions in terms of headcount. So we probably in terms of the total O&M and SDG&E, there's probably about 20% that can be directly impacted outside of other required spending. They've done a remarkable job today and that's the type of cost efficiency that was put into our rate case. The second thing I'll say is, what we've tried to do at the parent company is, as we sell our solar business and our wind business and our natural gas storage business, a lot of these cost savings are costs we can realign more efficiently, increasing span of control of officers and leaders, so that we can have a lower cost platform at the parent company, as we sell and become more focused in our strategy. And then as to your issues around the 2019 guidance, always remind you that we basically took a $100 million out of earnings, right. So, at the Analyst Conference we forecasted 2019 without any -- without taking out solar and renewables out of that forecast, so, in July of last year we -- we forecasted $5.70 to $6.30 of EPS. And today, that's our exact same guidance after taking $100 billion of earnings out of it, for our renewable portfolio and the way you do that is to use the proceeds to pay down parent debt. You reinvest in capital programs. You go to the investment in Texas within InfraREIT and you continue to find cost savings. And I will tell you I expect a $50 million number to go up by the end of the year because we're going to keep going in terms of making our parent company more efficient. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : And GRC assumptions, nothing to say -- right, nothing to add right now? Jeff Martin : Yes. I just say on the GRC assumptions, our convention over the last decade has been to always forecast the existing attrition of 3.5%. We've done that at both of our utilities and I think the filings that you can see from ORA and others, you can kind of draw your own conclusions in many cases, they are actually higher than that. But we're not going to guide or change that until we get to this rate case. We are focused on making sure we have a good cost of capital filing by April 1st, and we're pushing very aggressively to make sure that we can improve the timings of our rate case decision. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Shah Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Constantine Lednev : Hey. It's actually Constantine here for Shahriar. A lot of great questions were answered. And congrats on a strong quarter and a great year. One, kind of short little follow-up on the cost of capital filing. So, any thoughts around, kind of how you're thinking about it, at this point. There has been some kind of early remarks with kind of the FERC ROE is done and all that, but in light of kind of some of the more recent events, kind of, what are your thoughts around cost of capital in California? Jeff Martin : I'll give you some thoughts and pass it to Trevor. But I would just say this, as you know, at a high level, the cost of capital is always intended to be a proxy of the risk associated with our environment right in our regulatory environment. So, there is no question, given the recent developments, particularly the northern part of the state that you should expect to see PG&E and Edison and SDG&E and SoCalGas revisit how that happens. Right. So you're right, there are some numbers out there for the first standpoint, but we're going to make sure that we're very thoughtful of bringing some independent resources and we're going to put forward something that we think is better reflective of the risk in the marketplace. And if some of that risk is resolved that likewise would impact how we would file this. But Trevor, would you add any color. Trevor Mihalik : No, I think, Jeff, you really covered it there again. As Jeff said it's supposed to be a proxy on risk and I think we feel pretty good about where we landed on FERC, but we certainly anticipate that cost capital filing should reflect the risk that we're seeing in the state. Jeff Martin : And I would add that Bruce Folkmann is our CFO at both of our utilities. He is a very talented person and he really led the last cost of capital discussion, I think on behalf of all three utilities. He has a team in place with outside consultants and they'll be putting together a very thoughtful plan about how they approach this. And I think that you're raising a great point. And this is something that we're very focused on. We're going to try to basically improve the regulatory model this year. We're going to get a great rate case and we are going to get a cost of capital that's appropriately sized for the type of risk that we expect to manage in the state. Constantine Lednev : Perfect. Thanks. And one kind of just detailed question, housekeeping on the cost savings program that's being implemented. And you've kind of called out the $50 million in the run rate in the next few -- in the following few years. Is there any detail of how to think about the overall kind of costs at the parent and kind of where that $50 million is coming from and where kind of any incremental opportunities lie? Jeff Martin : Yes. I would just say that the best way to think about this is probably the most common misunderstanding Constantine. We have an ongoing cost management program every year in the history of the company. So SDG&E will have stretch goals, and one of the ways they reach their stretch goals like you saw the great performance last year and Trevor talked about it is, continuing to have best practices around technology and innovation and cost efficiency. So every single operating company at Sempra is very, very focused on leveraging technology and innovation to lower their per unit cost for customers. What was unique about what the exercise we went through under Martha Wyrsch and Dennis' leadership in the last six months was, we really revisited opportunities at the parent company, because as you sell and dispose some assets and turn your portfolio over, it gave us the opportunity to challenge, what is the proper role of External Affairs and Investor Relations and Financial Reporting. And you have people at corporate that were directly servicing the solar business or the wind business or natural gas storage. So most of the cost opportunity has been around looking at costs associated with the businesses that we're selling and now as you know, last month we took the decision to sell our South American utilities. That represents another opportunity for us to become more cost efficient at the parent. So the long-term goal is you got to remember, we're going to grow this business at a rate faster than our peers. And as we grow this business, one of the things we're going to try to do is keep the cost at parent, the ones that we control. I'm not talking about interest expense and preferred dividends and so forth.I'm talking about the things that we can normally control. Our job is to keep it flat to declining at the same time that we're scaling the corporate center against a growing set of operating companies. Constantine Lednev : Okay. So it's fair to kind of assume that as these transactions close, and as you go through the transformation process, and the savings programs are going to continue further into more than just the 2019 here? Jeff Martin : That's well said, and part of that is because, we will have ongoing service obligations for short periods of time on the assets that we sold, and part of what you're looking at is those service obligations rolling off throughout the year. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Good morning, Jeff. Two questions, kind of unrelated to each other. First of all the California cost of capital docket. Given what's happened to your neighbor to the North and just how the California utilities have traded? It seems a little bit unusual to meet even half (ph) the stock, I mean how do you calculate the cost to equity for one of the three companies in the state? Just curious if there's potential to kind of push this out to come back and revisit this at -- in another year, at another time or whether the commissioners and the state as a whole is kind of driving to make sure this happens in 2019? Jeff Martin : Well, it's actually a very insightful question. If you think back to the California utilities track record around cost of capital, you have seen the cost of capital extended for one or two or three years at a time, and you've seen the utilities get engaged from time to time when you see large changes in the marketplace. What intrigues me a little bit Michael is that, there has been a strong voice coming from the credit rating agencies about rerating the state. Right? There's obviously been a very unfortunate bankruptcy in the casualties to the north, obviously this has implications to Edison as it does to SoCalGas and SDG&E. And part of the process, I think is going on, as you have a change in the governor, you got to change in a lot of the members of his administration, even some of the energy principles or change in off of Governor Brown staff. So basically have a new guard in Sacramento, to have some strong voices coming from the credit markets and have the chance to come back in on a timely basis and really lay down some numbers that really point to the cost of not properly managing risk. These costs inadvertently get passed on to ratepayers. So there is really a hue and cry to fix the market, and I actually think this cost of capital process may be additive to that voice and constructive in long-term toward getting the action. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then unrelated question. Just curious, there have been a number of LNG projects in the US and in North America, including Canada. If their environmental impact statements are FERC certificates and just curious how the LNG contracting environment has changed over the last 6 to 12 months and how the economics for new LNG for projects like Port Arthur even ones like Costa Azul or the Cameron expansion look now relative to how they may have looked a year or two years ago? Jeff Martin : Great question. I think you recall that we were similar to our new management team last summer. We took the time Michael to do a bottoms-up view of what we thought was taken place in the global marketplace, and that we had a better feel for that. We looked at our own team, our own capabilities and you saw us raise our expectations for what we could accomplish Michael, as well as make some change in terms of how we were leading that organization. I would tell you today that I'm probably more bullish than I was three or four months ago. I mean I think Joe and I are on the road starting this weekend, going overseas to meet with potential offtakers. But to your point, you recall that Cameron was originally constructed really as a tolling agreement, no different you think about as a power plant. Right? You're short gas on one side of the plant and your long LNG on the other, and we structured that really as a tolling situation where Sempra was not really involved in the downstream risk the upstream risk related to that facility. One of the things is taking place in the marketplace is the number and type of counter parties has expanded to folks like the oil and gas company in Poland, is they now expect somewhat at the terminal to go upstream and source the gas, and frankly as long as we can do that some form of index, where we're not taking the commodity risk. We're certainly a business is quite comfortable with transportation. So you've seen the model change a little bit where you're moving probably from a pure Toll model toward being able to provide the service of bringing the gas to one side, whereas they take all responsibility for the gas on other. And look, a competitive market always puts pressure on the cost side of it, but one of the things I think that I would mention to you is, we have a competitive advantage, and our competitive advantage is, that two of our three sites are brownfield sites, number one. And number two, the fact that we have one on the West Coast of North America is a huge advantage. And you should be expecting us to push that aggressively in all of our marketing meetings, but I'll just stop there, Joe and see if you will add anything to the contract environment. Joe Householder : The only thing I would say in addition, one thing I want to start with is we're going to spend a bunch of time on this at our analyst conference, which is coming up in a few weeks. So I won't go into too much detail but, we are very focused. The world has changed a little bit and you're right, we are starting to see a lot of action at FERC and our project at Port Arthur is moving through that queue, it's very close in the queue now. So it's moving right ahead. And so the contracting is indeed important and we have seen a change. There was a law for a while, now we're starting to see that really come together. As Jeff said, we got airline tickets we're -- we're heading out, and so that shows a good sign. We will talk more about this at the conference, but we are absolutely right. We're starting to see quite a change and we're going to see more and more projects go to FID. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Just want to touch base with you on the wildfire, the prudency standard that you guys are looking for at the CPUC. And I was wondering in-light of sort of the recent activity, obviously the bankruptcy at PG&E and stuff. Are you sensing more traction with respect to having the prudency standard of -- you know to be substantially -- substantial compliance with the wildfire plan or how are you looking at that, it sounds like you and Edison sort of have been proposing that in this OIR? Jeff Martin : What I would say, Paul, is that one of the things that makes the overall conversation quite complex is that there is a basket of legacy fires, some of which were in '17 prelegislation and some of which were in '18 during a gap, because the legislation was effective until the first of the year. From a big picture standpoint I think Sempra has been very much in the position that PG&E has been in for a long period of time, which we don't think is a strict liability standards, the appropriate standard for investor-owned utilities. Right? It was intended for a different set of circumstances. I think it's very unfortunate, that we moved decisions we got at the PUC. I think that really has been the catalyst for the possibility of there being uncovered or stranded cost actually borne by shareholders. And that's led to the situation we're in now. So, I think the challenge you have Paul is that the legislators put a lot of time in SB 901 last year, and they thought that they had put the appropriate band-aid on the issue, and like what we're really asking for is, I think the whole process as we looked at de novo with a fresh view. I'm really encouraged. I think the strike force specifically and the Blue Ribbon panel is not just taking the fact as they are today, Paul. I'm really looking at this thing holistically, around all the things that Dennis talked about, the insurance industry, what does this mean to tort claims. What does this mean to the legal industry and the impacts of the utility. So, I don't want to make this sound like this is a small change to legislation. We have a goal of making sure that we have the chance to operate our system prudently. Make prudent capital investments, and as fires occur from time to time, were substantially in compliance with the program as they approved by the commission, there should be automatic pass-through of costs. It's not a discretionary standard. Paul Patterson : Yes. I think that sounds great. It would seem to me that regardless of what happens with strict liability or what have you, if that standard is adopted, I mean, obviously there's a lot more that you want to accomplish for a lot of reasons, repair costs to be -- not the least of which but, that would be, I mean this one issue, if you could get that resolved. It would seem to me that would go a long way. Do you follow what I'm saying and that might be one way of sort of -- I mean, I know it's not silver bullet, but it would be something that would seem to go a long way in solving a lot of this without necessarily relying on the holistic thing to be completely sewn-up. Do you follow what I'm saying? Jeff Martin : I do Paul and I think first off, I think you're spot on. But the only caveat I'd offer to you is, where you start your focus has a direct impact of what you end up resolving. And I think that we need to be very clear that's a strict liability standard is the wrong standard. At the end of the day you may have the practical solution, it may be less relevant is where that standard goes away, or whether that standard is interpreted by rule making that allows for the automatic pass-through for people that operate your system prudently. So I think you're on to something. What I am encouraged by is, the leadership the Governor is showing the way that he has staffed in saying and asked them to move more quickly and he's asked for them to look at it holistically, with a fresh view de novo. Right. So again I can't forecast the future, except to say that I think a lot of the right activities are under way and we are optimistic. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just finally the McDermott call, the discussion of Chiyoda came up, and I'm just wondering, we couldn't really obviously and I'm not asking you to comment on the Chiyoda situation, but they themselves as you know, said -- raised ongoing -- as a ongoing concern question, could you just remind us what kind of contingencies we have, if in fact Chiyoda isn't able to meet its obligations? Jeff Martin : I will start and I'll see if Joe wants to add some color, but I think in our remarks, what you've heard is, that the partnership has been very engaged with the EPC contractors, and particularly McDermott has been very clear about what their expectations are for delivering the project. And obviously those two parties are jointly and separately liable for their obligations under that contract, and it's a full EPC wrap contract, right. So those obligations reside with the EPC. But I got to tell you we have had great conversations with David Dixon. I think he has looked at this with clear eyes. He understands the challenges, and we have confidence and the ability to deliver it. But, Joe if you want to comment further on some of the details around those two parties. Joe Householder : Thanks, Jeff. I think you really hit the main points. Great EPC contract, joint and separate liability, also, as we said a few times in the past, we do have letters of credit backstopping this, in typical amounts that you would see in a contract of this nature. And so those are the kinds of things. We always have to plan for any risk and so we have a lot of work around all of this with our partners, but we feel really confident, David's, very confident that is going to focus and get this project done. And I believe he is focused on it. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our last question from Winfried Fruehauf of Winfried Fruehauf Consulting. Winfried Fruehauf : I have a question about PG&E, and is a two part question. One is, what lessons has Sempra learned from the bankruptcy filing, or yes, that's the first question. The second question is, are there any opportunities for asset purchases from PG&E by Sempra? Jeff Martin : Well, thank you for that question. I'll start with the second part of the question first and I'll circle back the lessons learned. I think you recall you followed us for a long time, Winfried that, we don't typically comment on any type of M&A activity. As we've had discussions on our management team, our slate of organic spending in our core businesses here in North America over the next two years, is quite significant. One of the things you should expect for our management team is to have our head down and make sure we execute well our financial plans for 2019 and 2020. On the larger issue of lessons learned, it's quite interesting, we learned a lot Winfried from our 2007 wildfire, we viewed it like an existential threat 10 years ago, and it really has informed our view that we have to get better and we have to provide leadership, we have to be innovative and everything we do is open source. I mean, all the progress we've made, we're more than willing to share with others. But I will give you one discrete thing from the bankruptcy that we find interesting is, you'll see a lot of numbers out there about the potential costs that are contingent liabilities related to the renewable contracting. And you'll hear -- numbers above $30 billion being forecasted in large portions of that be an out of market cost. It goes back to over the last four or five years, the deep strategic process that our Board has led, we made the decision, number one, that we wanted to exit fossil fired generation. We've made the decision to exit renewable generation. We do not get involved in lifting natural gas or oil or field processing. So we've moved further and further away from generation and commodity and procurement, and as early as 2014 myself and Steve and Davis at SDG&E decided to stop all of our renewable purchases at SDG&E because we're well ahead of the game at that time. So I think the lesson that points to here is, it's very important to make sure we're doing all the right things to advance the clean energy transition, but it's also important that we're doing that in a way which is thoughtful around price, diversity of supply in a balanced energy program. And I think that what you see at PG&E continues to confirm Sempra's business model, number one of focus in on T&D and the prudency I think that we've shown around a balanced energy approach to the commodity side of the business. Winfried Fruehauf : That's very helpful. Thanks very much, Jeffrey. Jeff Martin : I appreciate it Winfried. We hope we see you at the Analyst Conference. Winfried Fruehauf : I'm not so sure because I'm physically still not in a position to do much traveling. Jeff Martin : Okay. We wish you the best and look forward to staying in touch with you. Operator : Thank you. As there are no further questions, we'll hand the call back to Jeff Martin for closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Look, I just like to thank everyone for joining us today. I'll conclude by saying that I'm very pleased with our team, and I think we're excited about the progress we've made on our strategy. And we look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Analyst Conference here in San Diego later in March. If you have any follow-up questions, always feel free to contact the IR team. And have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Faisel Khan. Please go ahead. Faisel Khan : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's first quarter 2019 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our Web site under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 7, 2019, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot, Faisel. I'd like to thank everyone who attended our Investor Day here in San Diego. We appreciated having the opportunity to provide a comprehensive update on our strategy and capital plans and enjoyed taking many of you to visit our LNG facility in Baja, California, as well as SDG&E where we highlighted our wildfire mitigation program and showcased our other California utility assets. We hope you came away from our conference with the following : First, we have a sharper strategic focus, second, we've improved our capital discipline and third, we are investing in a high performance culture. Since our Investor Day, we held our internal top 300 leadership meeting, leaders across our company came together here in San Diego to discuss steps we're taking to better align our 20,000 employees to directly support our strategic mission of becoming North America's premier energy infrastructure company. There was a great sense of energy amongst the team as we set our course for the next year and beyond. From an execution standpoint, we continue to make progress on our goals. Just last month, we completed the sale of our wind assets, which bring the total cash proceeds from our renewable to midstream divestitures to approximately $2.5 billion. Well above market expectations. Next our focus is on successfully completing the planned sale of our South American businesses, which we're targeting to close around the end of this year. Proceeds from our asset sales will be used to advance our strategic mission by funding growth while also strengthening our balance sheet by paying down parent debt. Now, looking forward, Sempra is well-positioned, our business is at the intersection of two key trends that are transforming the energy markets, the transition towards cleaner energy, which is happening market-by-market, and the US's growing dominance in the global energy markets. We expect our assets to play a key role in furthering both of these trends, which in turn should create jobs both in the United States and Mexico, bolster the economies of both countries and drive future value creation for our shareholders. Before handing off the call to Joe, I'd also like to highlight that we're affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range as well as our 2020 EPS guidance range. Please turn to the next slide, where Joe will discuss how we're executing on our operational goals. Joe Householder : Thanks, Jeff. Before touching on some of the legislative discussions happening in California on wildfire risk, I'd like to mention that last week the CPUC issued a favorable proposed decision on SDG&E's wildfire mitigation plan, enabling us to continue to improve our industry leading program. Now, on the legislative front, we're pleased with Governor Newsome and the strike force's leadership and their proposals. The most important aspects are mitigating the threat of wildfires through measures such as increased vegetation management, advancing emergency response to minimize damage if an event occurs, and defining proposals that can help ensure healthy utilities to achieve California's greenhouse gas reduction goals. We believe the strike force's recent recommendations of a liquidity fund, a wildfire fund, and changes to inverse condemnation help narrow the focus of the Blue Ribbon Commission. We're actively engaged to help ensure that our customers and our shareholders' interests are addressed and that our existing wildfire mitigation efforts are recognized. We're optimistic that effective legislative solutions could be introduced and approved this summer. Although positive headway is being made the current regulatory environment and threat of wildfires in this state are factors we must take into account in our regulatory filings including that cost of capital proceeding. Please turn to slide six. This CPUC cost of capital proceeding is very important to our two utilities, because our currently authorized return on equity numbers were last updated in July of 2017, and were the result of a two-year extension from our cost of capital proceeding approved in 2013. A lot has happened since 2017, and even more so since 2013. Over this time period, in California, customer needs, state mandates, energy goals, the environment, the regulatory construct, have all changed considerably. They've had a corresponding and material impact on the risk profile of California investor-owned utilities. to : With this in mind, we request that first an increase to our authorized ROEs, at SDG&E we requested a base ROE of 10.9% plus a 3.4% ADAR [ph] for a total of 14.3%, an increase from our currently authorized ROE of 10.2%. We have arrived at the wildfire ADAR by estimating risks associated with potential unrecoverable wildfire liability, premiums required by insurers and premiums required by investors in our catastrophe bonds. At SoCalGas, we requested an ROE of 10.7% compared to it's currently authorized ROE of 10.05%. And second an increase in our authorized capital structure to 56% equity for both utilities, which has been our average actual capital structure over the past five years and puts us within the range of debt ratios for Moody's A rated regulated electric and gas utility companies. We believe our ROE applications are appropriate based on our financial modeling, input from external consulting experts and taking into account the current capital markets and regulatory environment. We also believe the applications will help to ensure the credit worthiness and financial integrity of our California utilities. For additional perspective, our base ROE requests are similar to our authorized ROEs prior to 2012, which were around 11%. We submitted our FERC cost of capital filing for SDG&E in October of last year, which included a proposed ROE of 11.2% compared to our current ROE of 10.05%. In terms of timing, settlement discussions have started and are expected to go through the second half of the year. A requested FERC ROE increase is clearly lower than our proposed CPUC ROE increase. This is primarily due to the fact that when these applications were filed, events that have occurred since that time and most importantly differences in the probability of cost recovery between the two regulatory jurisdictions. Regarding our 2019 GRC filings, based on the activity we've seen, we continue to believe will receive a proposed decision from the CPUC in mid 2019 with an effective date of January 1, 2019. Southern California Edison recently received their proposed decision but from a timing perspective each rate case is assessed on an individual basis and is led by different commissioners and administrative law judges. We continue to believe our proposals are in the best interests of all stakeholders involved with a focus on safety and reliability for our customers. Please turn to the next slide. Shifting to our Texas Utility business, we're happy to report the settlement has been reached with key stakeholders in on course proposed acquisition of InfraREIT and Sempra's proposed acquisition of a 50% interest in Sharyland, the last regulatory steps in the transaction or approval and a final order from the PUCT. This is consistent with our previous timeline and we would expect to close the transaction in mid-2019. Now, please turn to slide eight. I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing our infrastructure businesses. Let me start with Cameron. As you'll recall, at our Investor Day, we were able to raise Sempra's projected annual run rate earnings guidance range for Cameron LNG Phase 1 to $400 million to $450 million. Train 1 continues to achieve key milestones to support its timeline and most recently we introduced feed gas in mid-April. We expect to begin producing LNG from this train shortly and began recognizing earnings in mid-2019. Based on updated disclosures, the EPC contractor now expects Train 2 to produce LNG in Q1 2020 and Train 3 to produce LNG in Q2 of 2020 due to a longer construction and commissioning schedule. Moving on to our development projects both ECA and Port Arthur recently received non-FDA approval to export LNG. Additionally, Port Arthur received FERC authorization to site, construct and operate the LNG facility. These approvals bring us one step closer to reaching FID for these important projects. Related to IEnova, we're still targeting commercial delivery of natural gas at the Marine pipeline in the second quarter of this year. At the terminal businesses IEnova announced two new capacity contracts with a global integrated oil company. This included an additional contract for 740,000 barrels of storage at the previously announced [indiscernible] marine terminal development project as well as 290,000 barrels of capacity at a new storage terminal project in Guadalajara. This new Guadalajara terminal is our seventh terminal project and one of 12 projects currently in development or under construction. Please turn to the next slide, where Trevor will review our financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Joe. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $441 million or $1.59 per share. This compares favorably to first quarter 2018 earnings of $347 million or $1.33 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter earnings were $534 million or $1.92 per share. This compares favorably to our first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $372 million or $1.43 per share. Please turn to slide 10, where I'll discuss the key drivers of our quarterly results. The variance in our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following items, $79 million of higher equity earnings at the Sempra Texas utility segment resulting from the acquisition of our interest in Oncor in March of 2018. $35 million and $31 million at SoCalGas and SDG&E respectively related to the January 2019 CPUC decision allocating certain deferred income tax balances to shareholders. This benefit was included in our 2019 adjusted guidance. $23 million of higher earnings from South American operation including $15 million at Peru due to an increase in rates and lower cost of purchase power and $7 million of higher earnings combined from both utilities as a result of lower depreciation due to the assets classified as held for sale. $21 million in lower expense related to foreign currency and inflation effects net of foreign currency hedges in Mexico, and $15 million of higher earnings at Sempra LNG from our marketing operations primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices which was offset by $18 million of lower operational earnings at SDG&E comprised of $27 million of lower CPUC base operating margin in 2019 due to the delay in the 2019 GRC decision while absorbing higher operating costs. Offset by $9 million of higher earnings from electric transmission operations. And $25 million of higher cost related to increased net interest expense and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend at parent driven by the Oncor acquisition. Please turn to slide 11. To recap, we continue to execute on our path to premier. Looking forward, our key priorities are executing on our $25 billion five-year base capital plan, optimizing our capital allocation with a focus on strengthening the balance sheet, advancing our LNG development opportunities and engaging with stakeholders in key regulatory and legislative proceedings at our U.S. utilities. We believe our strategic mission and disciplined capital allocation plan should help us reach our operational and financial goals well into the future. With that, we will conclude the prepared remarks and stop to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : Hi, guys, how are you doing? Jeff Martin : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : Couple of questions, I think obviously the quarter -- quarterly earnings were significantly better than consensus. And I think that utility analysts no matter how long they have been doing this and have been doing it quite a while often have time -- hard time with the quarterly lease [ph], just given how the regulatory model in California causes things to be extremely lumpy sometimes. In this case, it was the utility income tax benefit that was $66 million positive on the quarter. I know that you put that -- there was also a footnote that was also in your full-year guidance range which you gave on analyst day. But, it's probably not a recurring item even though it's considered an ongoing item. So, how do we bridge to 2020 to the growth guidance that you gave for SDG&E and SoCal Gas? What are sort of not in any specific mathematical terms, but in general terms that sort of replace that and offset it so that you can show growth despite that item being sort of a onetime thing? Jeff Martin : Well, thanks for that question, Greg. And obviously I think there is a number of big levers in front of us for 2019. And you can probably list a lot of these. But obviously we are quite focused on getting our GRC approved for both SoCal Gas and SDG&E. You will recall that the year one step up in our filed request for SoCal Gas was closed to a 20% step up and a 10% step up in the attrition for SDG&E. And then in the outer years, SDG&E is roughly 5% to 6% ad SoCal Gas is in 6% to 7%. So, the outcome of the GRC is important both for 2019 and 2020. And I will remind you that in the recorded results for Q1, we held there are no additional attrition revenues above what we guided in 2018. So that should lead to some form of understatement for Q1. Second, you will recall that we have got our FERC ROE pending. I think we requested 11.2% at several hundred basis points above where we are currently at. The expected effective date for that FERC decision independent of when it's going to be ruled upon is the 1st of June, 2019. And then obviously the cost of capital proceeding at the PUC is really, really foundational to what we are trying to accomplish. And in our base plan we have requested a 10.9% number 4 SDG&E. You have followed us enough you will recall in the '08 to 2012 timeframe it was slightly higher than that. I think it was 11.1%. So we think that's adequate, and you did note that we have a 3.4% ADAR [ph] relative to whether the reforms that we are expect in the summer are adequately put in place. The same number for SoCal Gas is a 10.7% ROE. So, in general there is going to some moving pieces in '19. But our ability to execute well around those regulatory initiatives will have a big impact on 2020. Greg Gordon : Thanks. My second question bit more general. The governor's framework is released by his I think he calls his strike team or strike force contemplate several ideas to solve the wildfire -- destruction of wildfire problem. And one of them is the idea of this catastrophic wildfire fund. And the understanding is that multiple constituencies would be asked to potentially contribute to capitalize that including the state but also including the utilities. And that that would create a buffer between utility balance sheets and potential future wildfire claims such that inverse condemnation would essentially in many ways be immunized and then if you see [indiscernible] later. I mean how do you contemplate that? Is that a viable outcome for you? Because in some ways I think investors look at it say, well, that's a little bit frustrating. From a Sempra-specific perspective since you have best-in-class wild fire safety provisions. You haven't had a fire in 10 years. And yet, you might be asked to contribute some amount as fund, in the long run it might be in the best interest of your shareholders to contemplate that. And on the other hand you have the best-in-class safety record. So can you talk about you are thinking about the evolution of this negotiation and what that might look like? Jeff Martin : Yes. It's a very thoughtful question. Let me try and do this. I will give you a couple contextual comments first. And then I will talk about some of the levers that could be put in play that will bridge buffer that you referred to. First off, we probably will stop short of forecast and the outcome. But I can say across our management team, we have growing optimism that will get some things done this summer that will be adequate. First off, I commented on this on the Q4 call, the Governor Newsome [indiscernible] strong leadership. And I think one of the things I try to focus on, Greg, is up and down the state all the right people that you would expect to be at the table are highly engaged which I think is promising. Secondly, you referenced the strike force report. But it does lay out a roadmap for preventing future wildfires in the future. And this is the point you made a comment on SDG&E. We have been a leader in this regard. We have been recognized nationally. So I think that it gives us some credibility to be at the table. And then thirdly, the commission that was established under SD-901, as this report due to legislature on July 1, I think that will be an important thing for all the investor on utilities and investors to track. But there are three key working groups out of that commission now focused on utility cost for coverage standards, wildfire funding mechanisms and insurance supportability. And the heart of your questions goes to this issue of wildfire funding mechanism. And I would say this first off we think it's a good idea to have this type of fund in place. I think it provides confidence to the market. It protects the utility balance sheet. And just as importantly, it gives people who have incurred damages, Greg, access to liquidity which I think inspires some confidence in the marketplace. But the mechanism by which that funding level is met and the funding level is determined continues to be play. I don't want to speculate too much except to say that I know that the reduction of the subrogation rights of insurers that provide wildfire insurance to consumers is actively under consideration. Also note that there is a variety things in the existing rate making formula in California such as the Department of Water Resources bonds which are rolling off here in the short term. So, there is going to be some headroom in existing rates relative to how we might raise those dollars. And like you, we have also heard some of the discussions around potential equity contributions. It's probably quite frankly too early to speculate on that, except to say that we are certainly a significantly small fraction of the state in terms of exposure. We have invested $1.5 billion to date in hardening our backcountry, and our vegetation management programs, we spent another $300 billion. So, around fire science, our risk fuel content in the backcountry, it's something like that came to the floor. We certainly think that any contributions from us should recognize the points that you made, which we're in a materially different situation. Greg Gordon : Thank you, very clear. Have a good morning. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Analyst and Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Hi, thank you. Excuse me. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Good morning. Turning to Cameron, could you just first of all, clarify that the dates are all first LNG dates, so in terms of actually turning it into earnings producing asset is that like three months after, six months after what is the rough timeline for turning it commercial? Jeff Martin : Yes, what we usually look for is that she usually four to six weeks after you get first LNG, it gets a substantial completion as well as earnings. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then I know this isn't an issue by 2021, but just for 2020. How should we think about the delay in terms of your guidance range? Jeff Martin : Well, I think in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that there's really no change. I mean, frankly, you go back to the analyst conference, and we were looking at different contingencies for the year, we build in the expectations of a potential delay like this but 2021 I think, to your point, Steve is still when we expect full run rate earnings. And you recall that at our Investor Day, we raised our expectations around that to $400 million to $450 million. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then maybe just switching gears on to California wildfire fixes. So all the right people together, et cetera, just do you think it's feasible to get done by this July timeframe? Are you more focused on just by the end of the session? And what will kind of where you keyed off of to kind of say that this will get done? Jeff Martin : Well, we're actually entertaining some of the key stakeholders in Sacramento here in San Diego later this week actually have a group of senior folks and administration tour in our wildfire science center at SDG&E, which we think is positive. All the right conversations are being ahead, we certainly thank Tony Atkins, who's from San Diego, has a very important role to play in the Senate. The governor's got the right folks on it. Guggenheim is our independent financial advisor. They've been meeting with all the credit rating agencies. In fact, some of the agency has actually been out to Sacramento. So we think to your original point, all the right folks are at the table, I continue to be very keyed off of this July 1st date, which is the date that the Blue Ribbon Panel is supposed to make the report to the legislature, which I think is important. And then obviously, there has been a commitment to try to get a bill that is comprehensive to the legislature, the middle of July, which I think is a second data point to follow. But look, I go back to the point Steve but this is the fifth largest economy in the world, we have had a premium regulatory climate here for several decades, I think there is growing recognition in all of my conversations, that they understand the value of having A rated balance sheets from the investor on utilities. I think that, we remain optimistic, we'll get something done. Steve Fleishman : One last quick question just on the GRC, so we did finally get an Edison GRC and I guess some of the issues there were mixed, but I know you filed. Your GRC, I think it was the first one done under the ramp filing mechanism. So I guess the question really is, how should we view the Edison proposed decision as a parameter at all for years? Jeff Martin : I'll make a couple comments and see if Joe wants to add some, but internally, Steve, the way we've talked about it is, it's apples and oranges, right, so this risk assessment program that we use for our rate case, really went into all the fundamentals of how you rank a hierarchy of risk operationally in your service territory. And then you've got to tie that to expected capital spending, right? To make sure that you end up with a different risk mitigated set of outcomes. And if you look at the backdrop that the commission is reviewing our ramp based GRC, that backdrop is around how we take risk out of the system and move toward more constructive regulation. So I'm not sure how much precedent I would assign to the Edison case that Joe do you want to add anything about how you're thinking about our rate case? Joe Householder : Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Hi, Steve. I think you have to consider a few things when you think about it. First each rate case filing is very different, they have different assigned commissioners, different staff, different ALJs, we've already talked about the ramp, I don't need to repeat that, but our filing incorporates safety and reliability spending as directed by the PUC a large component of the filing for SDG&E was including additional wildfire mitigation efforts that include accelerating the hardening increase vegetation management above and beyond what we have to do additional fire prevention technology. And if you look at the wildfire mitigation plan that we have, that was just approved, there's little additional capital in there because most of us already incorporated in this GRC ramp request, and if so, kind of the same thing. It's a continuation of integrity management for transmission, distribution, and storage. So we think we have a very thoughtful filing around safety, reliability, and most of all, importantly, affordability for our customers. So we think as Jeff said, they're apples and oranges. Steve Fleishman : Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thanks, Steve. Joe Householder : Thanks Operator : Next, we'll go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me? Jeff Martin : Good morning, Julien. You are loud and clear. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. So perhaps just to clarify a couple of things that have already been followed up on here. How do you think about the wildfire mitigation plans and some of the responses and the propositions that came back of late on the LJ side? I suppose, how do you think about translating a wildfire mitigation plan into some form of prudency. And now given the way the things have been developing, how do you think about clarifying that from a legislative perspective? Obviously, this is one Nexus. I'd be curious on your perspectives? Jeff Martin : Yes, I'll make two comments in that regard and Joe you feel free to come in behind me but you recall that our wildfire mitigation plan was focused on fire hardening vegetation management, increase in our aerial support, so we have a 24-hour capability with the night time flying helicopter. And then, you may recall, Julien, we've got 177 weather stations in the back country, six of those will be retrofitted as part of our plan. And we've asked for an incremental $100 million to $200 million associated with our mitigation plan for 2019. And that augments what Joe covered because there's a fair amount of capital just in our ramp based GRC filing. So as you think about that contextually, then you move over to how you might think about assigned liability. What we're trying to do is move away from some type of discretionary standard, right? So if the goal is to make sure that you're substantially compliant, the whole goal of having this liquidity fund setup is to meet the needs of those people who have incurred losses. Separate and apart from that, you recall, Julien, that commission always retains discretion regarding penalties. If they think that there should have been a different standard and applied. So what we want to move away from is this idea of a discretionary standard where someone's interpolating, how well you've complied with your established wildfire mitigation plan? Trevor Mihalik : Yes, let me just add on onto that. Hi, Julien. Look, I think that I'm going to go back up to a different level. We really applaud the work of the governor and his leadership and trying to address this. He clearly recognizes that healthy utility companies are a key component of us providing clean, safe, and reliable energy. And in order to have healthy utility companies, we have to have certainty of recovery, right? We have to, and that includes cost in operating our business and those incurred as a result of the application of inverse if we're operating the normal course. So his strike force is laid out a path for the Blue Ribbon Commission and the California Legislature to achieve that. We think that's the way and as Jeff said, we need the certainty. And if you were to look at our U.S. Supreme Court filing, it goes through all of this, right? we have to have certainty of recovery. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: That's right. Trevor Mihalik : And you can't have it taken. So I think this is the point we need to make. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Clear. And then just turn it back over very quickly to the McDermott side of the equation. Just curious, are there ongoing negotiations here just to clarify after some of the commentary last week here about the status of the project and not necessarily related to timeline, but just cost and even in that there. Obviously, there is a lot of activity on their side of the equation. How do you think about your leverage in the situation to ensure not just timely completion but also completion on budget as it stands today? Jeff Martin : Let me take that, Julien, I think look for all of you the most important thing to recognize is this project is days away from beginning to produce LNG and start delivering it to our customers. And Cameron LNG and the EPC contractor have common goals in getting this world class project completed safely and reliable. And I want to kind of remind you all that simple risk managers' project and the imminent startup is very exciting for a few reasons. One, we were very low-cost world-class LNG project that has created substantial value for the shareholders to this high return asset that we have, it's a very high return asset, it's going to begin producing earnings very soon. Cameron LNG, the business is very strong, we have strong partners, we have strong contracts and that supports our long-term cash flows from this business. So remember we put in our old project, we're going to get like $12 billion of cash flows out of this thing. And there have been ongoing discussions with the contractor over the last year or so. They continue to move things a little to the right. You can see in McDermott's materials that they just have, they're going to end between the two of them about $1 billion to finish this thing. And so they they'd like to get some help but we would like to make sure we get the project done. We want to get it done. We want to get it done as soon as possible. Everybody's focused on it, what we're really excited about is we're starting up right now. And that's about all I can say right now. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Fair enough. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Julien. Operator : And Christopher Turnure from JPMorgan has our next question. Christopher Turnure : Good afternoon guys. Just a follow-up on the last question, Joe, is there a way that we can think about kind of your own internal processes for evaluating Cameron timing and cost in construction versus what the contractors are doing there because I think you're being very deliberate in your message that that is what they're forecasting, that's what their latest update points to. Certainly that was your message at the Analyst Day too and that was pretty recently that we had a affirmation of the old schedule versus now? Joe Householder : Look I think that we when I say we let me talk about Cameron LNG, Cameron LNG is a company, it's owned 50% by Sempra and 15.6% by the other three equity owners who are our customers. Cameron LNG has people on the ground at the site every day as they have since the start of the construction. And they oversee what's going on, their big engineering team looking at the forecast of the schedule. I can tell you that McDermott has since last year when they took over CB&I put a lot of focus and effort on this project and have gotten more deeply into the schedule and the cost over time as you've seen in their announcements. I think that David Dixon is very intent on getting this project done. He talks to all the partners as well as to Cameron LNG management. We have assessed it. We've had partners, engineers assess it. We've had our owners engineer assess it. We think the schedule is one that seems very reasonable but it's in the hands of the contractor which is Chiyoda and McDermott. So it's up to them to predict the schedule and the cost. We think that what's laid out there. We took that into account when we did our earnings guidance and that's I would say. Christopher Turnure : Okay, that's helpful color. And then could you just give us a little bit more detail on the LATAM sale process and kind of how that's progressing next milestones to look for and I guess versus a base case what might move that schedule forward or backward? Jeff Martin : Thank you. The current sales process is being handled by Trevor's our CFO and I'll let Trevor address the next milestone. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. Yes, we're progressing well on schedule. We've seen robust interest across the board for these businesses and these are great businesses. Interest has been wide ranged from financial investors to sovereign and pension funds. So we're targeting first round bids by the end of the second quarter and then go into the second round and then we're still targeting close sometime around the end of the year. Christopher Turnure : Okay. And nothing that could move that forward or backward based on what you're seeing right now? Trevor Mihalik : No, I think we've got a pretty formalized process that we're working through and we're still adhering to the schedule that we laid out. Christopher Turnure : Okay, great. Thanks, Trevor. Trevor Mihalik : Yes. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, Jeff. Hey, Joe. Thank you for taking my question. Real quick, if you had to peg which moves forward first, is it Cameron expansion so 4 and 5. Is it the Cameron expansions so 4 and 5. Is it the first trains at Port Arthur or is it the small train at Costa Azul and if so what are the next key milestones we ought to watch for? Jeff Martin : Thank you for that question, Michael, and I'll give some color commentary maybe Joe can add into it, but I think that the one that has the lead advantage currently is we currently have three Heads of agreement at ECA Phase 1 are fully contracted and all three of those are moving toward having SDAs in place. So just in terms of documentation that is further along in terms of being 100% contracted and moving toward more definitive agreement. I would also say that Cameron expansion is something we remain optimistic about. You recall that when Total stepped into RNG's position they made it very clear to their shareholders that one of the attractive aspects of being in the original Cameron partnership was they were committed and interested in seeing the expansion go forward which you may recall is something we were trying to do several years earlier. So, I think you've got line of sight to the three participants in the expansion and we continue to have a lot of positive work being done there to make sure that the underlying economic support that. And then obviously at Port Arthur, we've got 2 million tons per annum accounted for with our partner from Poland. We're continuing to have a lot of very positive conversations around Port Arthur and we think that is a remarkable site for a number of reasons. So I think in general, one of the things you'll recall that we did was we did a bottoms up strategic review of our LNG business over the last 12 months and came away with a view Michael that not only is it a core business to Sempra and Sempra can continue to add value in terms of balance sheet and expertise, we really raised our ambitions about what we thought we could accomplish. So we're actually feeling quite constructive on all three of those projects. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then a question on the settlement in Texas, any impact meaning the settlement regarding in for reading Sharyland, any impact of that settlement on the potential accretion dilution that you discussed when first announced? Jeff Martin : I would say that we've gone back and revisited our underlying economics and we feel equally good about how we underwrote that transaction before maybe 30 or 40 days of slippage in and out of where we expect to close it, we feel great about the transaction frankly. The type of growth that we outlined at the Investor Conference, Michael you recall really had a lot to do with that Sempra in West Texas opportunity and the InfraREIT transaction actually lays into that growth probably even better than we originally thought when we underwrote the deal. Michael Lapides : Got it, thank you, Jeff, much appreciated. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Next to go to Ryan Levine from Citi. Ryan Levine : Hi, given the recent weakness in global LNG [indiscernible], do you anticipate any customers who elect not to nominate or with LNG and Cameron 1 after the commissioning phase is complete. Can you comment on the nomination process now that you're nearing first half? Jeff Martin : I don't know if we'll go into kind of how we think about nominations Ryan but I think that we do take questions from time to time about whether we see the overall contract and model change and based upon our current conversations in the marketplace, Joe's been on the road, I'm on the road, Carlos Reese. We've got our entire management team been in over to make sure we're talking to the right folks. We still see this as a long-term contract in business and our goal is a first step as we move toward FID is making sure that we have high quality customers contracted for 20 years with very, very strong balance sheets. And remember we're really on the infrastructure side of business, right. So we want to play in exact same role or very similar to what we're doing in Cameron which is a telling model. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then on ECA with the non-FDA approval received, are there any remaining comments that the company still looking to procure? Jeff Martin : Yes, you raised a great point, we've got the non-FDA approval to export from the United States to Mexico and then to also export from Mexico abroad as issued by the Department of Energy. We also in this year got our Port Arthur approval from FERC. I'll let Joe comment on what other permits we have in Mexico and whether is there any other we're still pursuing. Joe Householder : Thanks, Joe. Hey, Ryan. Yes, really the major permit we got earlier about both the large scale and the mid scale site. And then as Jeff just mentioned the non-FDA, what we still need to get and we have applied for and we've done this before is we need our Mexican export permit. So that's underway. The other things are just small local permits around building the site but those come later in the process. But the only one that's more significant is this export from Mexico, we expect no problems with that. Ryan Levine : Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Our next question will come from Shah Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Constantine Lednev : Hi, good morning. It's actually Constantine here for Shah. A lot of the questions have been answered just a couple of kind of housekeeping items. So, on the LNG development projects, now that kind of permitting has been progressing. Can you talk about how you see kind of the ownership structure is going to be similar to Cameron where some of the off-takers might take an equity interest or just how to think about that going forward? Jeff Martin : Thank you for that question. I think as we went through our strategic review or LNG business over the last six to eight months, we've also been looking as we move toward an FID decision at ECA Phase 1 later this year and hopefully an FID decision around Port Arthur in Q1 of next year. One of the things we're looking at is how we finance these projects and the potential impacts to our balance sheet. But John a great point, as you saw in the Cameron facility Phase 1 Joe articulated this earlier our three partners are each and just over 16% participation. We think it's a great model to align the interests of partners around these large capital projects. And to your point we expect that will be a model, you'll continue to see us replicate going forward. I would say if you went up to a million feet and looked across the portfolio over LNG projects, we'd like to be in that 60% to 70% range of equity ownership in our projects. Constantine Lednev : Okay. So kind of thinking about it the same way as it's been, another just kind of small housekeeping item. You mentioned kind of the cost of capital application to equity ratio was going to kind of shore up the credit ratings but kind of both from your perspective and I guess what you can reflect from the CPUC, some of the downgrades have come not on the heels of just formulaic kind of metrics but also some of the regulatory and kind of legislative kind of structures around there. So how are you thinking about that kind of going towards credit metrics? Jeff Martin : Well, I mean we have spent a lot of time with our credit rating agencies and obviously they're very focused on the process. We've described on this call around making sure that the legislative and regulatory model moves back to standard utility practice and procedure rights. You always expect to have your reasonable costs returned plus an additional return on what's on your investments. I think that's what broke as you recall with the misapplication of the inverse combination model is, there has been a leakage of utilities ability to recover all the costs that they've incurred. So I think it's really a multipart effort, you've got to get back to the right regulatory regime that allows for the type of funding mechanisms to meet the liquidity requirements, you've got to get a improvement to the regulatory model and you've got to make sure that your return on equity reflects the risk in the marketplace. Now oftentimes said that your return on equity is intended to be a proxy for the regulatory financial and operator risk that you see in the marketplace and that's why we filed our updated ROE requests as we have. Constantine Lednev : Okay, so I guess it's fair to say that kind of progress on all fronts is what you're targeting in terms of second line? Jeff Martin : That's right. Constantine Lednev : Yes, that answers everything from me. Thanks. Jeff Martin : Thanks. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session today. I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Martin for closing remarks. Jeff Martin : I want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us on the call today. I would say as we've had conversations with our management team, we actually have a lot of exciting things that we're working on right now and look forward to seeing many of you on the road in the next couple of months and per custom. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to contact Faisel and the IR team. Have a great day. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Faisel Khan. Please go ahead. Faisel Khan : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President and Group President; George Bilicic, Group President; and Peter Wall, Vice President Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that, all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today August 2, 2019 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks, Faisal and thank you all for joining us today. We're really pleased with both the financial and operational progress, we've made so far this year. You'll recall that at our Investor Day, this past March, I discussed our goals for 2019. Those goals serve as our road map as we progress our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. Here's a snapshot of our progress this quarter against those goals. We completed the sale of our U.S. wind assets bringing the total proceeds from the sales of our U.S. solar wind and non-utility natural gas storage assets to roughly $2.5 billion. Second, we recycled a portion of that capital into Oncor's acquisition of InfraREIT and Sempra's acquisition of a 50% interest in Sharyland providing greater visibility into further growth in the Texas market. Third, we produced first LNG and expect commercial operations under the tolling agreements in mid-August at Cameron LNG Train 1. Fourth, we continue to advance our LNG development projects including signing the heads of agreement with Aramco Services Company at Port Arthur LNG. And lastly, we advanced the planned sale of our South American businesses, which is an important transaction as we continue to recycle capital and drive North American growth markets. Next, I want to talk about the recently passed wildfire legislation. It's important to acknowledge Governor Newsom. Together, with leadership from the California legislature Governor's Newsom's leadership was critical in passing new legislation that helps return California to a premier regulatory jurisdiction. It also enhances the operating environment and financial health of California's electric utilities enabling them to advance the state's goals of providing clean, safe and reliable electricity to their customers. Looking forward, we're focused on executing our strategic plan and progressing in a number of key areas that are important to our stakeholders such as resolving our ongoing discussions with CFE related to two of our pipelines in Mexico; receiving final GRC and cost of capital decisions here in California; executing on Oncor's robust five-year capital program of over $11 billion, while integrating the InfraREIT assets; and continuing our focus on completing Cameron LNG and reach an FID at ECA and Port Arthur LNG. Also with our strong year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of $3.03, today we are affirming our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.70 to $6.30. I would also remind you that we're still waiting our GRC proposed decisions for both California Utilities, which we expect in the coming weeks. We will also continue to monitor the movements in the Mexican peso. Both of these items may impact our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. And with that, please turn to the next slide where Joe will review some of our key operating updates. Joe Householder : Thanks, Jeff. And I'd like to echo your comments regarding the constructive wildfire legislation. We believe there are five key areas of the legislation that materially improve the operating environment for California's electric utilities. First, a wildfire fund, SDG&E will participate in a larger fund option which is expected to be supported by a continuation of the Department of Water Resources surcharge as well as utility shareholder contributions, potentially providing for a total fund amount of $21 billion. Coupled with the insurance obligation language in the law this could translate to a fund estimated to cover roughly $40 billion to $50 billion of potential wildfire damage. SDG&E's upfront contribution will be 4.3%, or $323 million and then $13 million annually over a 10-year period. Second an annual safety certification resulting in a presumption of prudency. SDG&E received this certification on July 26. Third, a new prudency standard of review more comparable to the FERC standard. This is important as it clarifies that any utility conduct considered in the prudency review must have been related to the ignition of the wildfire. This review must also take into account factors outside the utilities control like wind speed, humidity and temperature. Fourth, a rolling three-year shareholder liability cap for any potential future wildfire damages allocated to the utility under the prudency review. Currently, SDG&E's liability cap is approximately $825 million based on its 2018 electric T&D rate base and fifth, increased safety spending including $5 billion of required wildfire safety CapEx via the California IOU's wildfire mitigation plans. Consistent with the contribution to the wildfire fund, SDG&E share at 4.3% or $215 million. In terms of oversight, the legislation calls for the formation of a wildfire safety division, which will initially be within the CPUC and then transition to the newly created office of energy infrastructure safety in 2021. This wildfire safety division will hold the utilities accountable for mitigating wildfire risk and we look forward to working with them. We believe that these new laws substantially improve the regulatory model in California and support SDG&E's goal of delivering safe and reliable energy to our customers and the communities we serve. But let me emphasize one thing. Our goal of safely mitigating the risk of any wildfire across our service territory is a top priority as it has been for over a decade. Please turn to slide 6, where I'll discuss some of the regulatory updates at our California Utilities. Starting with the 2019 GRC, you'll recall that SDG&E and SoCalGas are the first California investor-owned utilities to incorporate the risk assessment mitigation phase into our GRC filings. This takes into account safety and reliability spending as directed by the CPUC. We anticipate a proposed decision will be issued in the coming weeks with a final decision expected by year-end. As a reminder, our financial plan and associated earnings guidance assume a 3.5% attrition rate through 2020. However, until we receive a final decision, we continue to record revenues consistent with 2018 levels. Any true-up related to adopted revenue requirement as well as balancing accounts and other provisions would be recognized in the quarter we received final CPUC approval, retroactive to the beginning of 2019. Trevor will discuss the related impact on quarterly results in more detail a little later on. Regarding our FERC cost of capital filing for SDG&E. Discussions continue with interveners, even though the procedural case is now in the litigation phase. Unless discussions progress an initial decision is expected in the second half of 2020. Moving on to the CPUC cost of capital filings at SDG&E. We filed revised testimony requesting an ROE of 12.38% including consideration of wildfire risk which were lowered from our initial request. This ROE request takes into account our estimation of the risk associated with potential future unrecoverable wildfire liabilities, premiums demanded by insurers and premiums required by investors in our catastrophe bonds. While the law helps to further mitigate any risk of future wildfire damages SDG&E could face, we believe this revised ROE request is reasonable and helps further our goal of delivering safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. We continue to expect a final decision by year-end in line with the regulatory schedule issued by the CPUC. Please turn to slide 7, where I'll talk about developments at our Texas utility. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we're pleased with closing the InfraREIT and Sharyland acquisitions, as they're both high-quality assets that expand our T&D footprint in Texas. Importantly, these acquisitions were funded with a portion of the proceeds from our completed asset sales and are another example of this management team's ability to effectively and efficiently redeploy capital into investments with strong risk-adjusted returns and premium markets. Oncor's robust five-year capital plan of more than $11 billion and corresponding infrastructure buildout will further support Texas' rapid growth. Oncor's assets are strategically located to take advantage of potential renewable additions, load growth from oil and gas development in the Permian Basin and continued demographic growth in urban centers around the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The Texas market continues to have a constructive regulatory environment with exceptional growth opportunities. Please turn to the next slide. We also continue to generate positive momentum at our LNG business. Starting with Cameron LNG, we couldn't be more pleased that Train one is delivering low-cost U.S. natural gas to our customers. This is a wonderful milestone for this project. We expect commercial operations under the tolling agreements in mid-August. Cameron LNG recently amended its EPC agreement to further align all parties to complete the project according to the EPC contractor's project schedule, which remains unchanged from what was previously disclosed. The amendment provides the contractor with the potential to earn incentive payments if it meets certain scheduled milestones in a timely manner. This agreement does not materially change our IRR from the project and maintains our expected full run rate earnings from Trains 1, 2, 3 of $400 million to $450 million annually. Now let me provide you some updates on our LNG development projects. We continue to be quite active. Notably over the last 10 months we signed HOAs MOUs and an SPA totaling 17.6 MTPA of potential offtake capacity with customers. At Port Arthur LNG we announced an HOA with Aramco Services Company for 5 MTPA of offtake capacity and a 25% equity stake in the project. This HOA combined with the Polish oil and gas company SPA, represents nearly 65% of the project's total offtake capacity. At ECA the Phase 1 development project continues to progress with a goal of reaching FID around the end of 2019. Aside from the activities at ECA this past quarter IEnova reached mechanical completion on the Marine Pipeline continued diversifying its business through contracts with private corporations and most recently announced offtake agreements with Marathon Petroleum and BP for capacity at the Manzanillo and Guadalajara liquids terminals and increase the capacity at the Manzanillo liquids terminal to approximately 2.2 million barrels. With regard to Mexico in general, we are not pleased with the recent developments regarding two of IEnova's pipelines and the IEnova management team along with deep engagement by the senior team here at Sempra are actively focused on reaching a timely resolution. We continue to work with the CFE, so that we can help deliver low-cost natural gas that benefits the people in Mexico. Regarding the development portfolio, IEnova continues to expand its infrastructure with nine projects under development or in construction. The offtake agreements for these projects are each with private enterprises, primarily major global energy companies. These projects will help provide access to cheaper and cleaner energy across the country. Now let me turn the call over to Trevor, who will review our financial results beginning with slide 9. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks Joe. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $354 million or $1.26 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2018 GAAP losses of $561 million or $2.11 per share. On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2019 earnings were $309 million or $1.10 per share. This compares to our second quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $361 million or $1.35 per share. Please turn to slide 10, where I'll discuss the key drivers of our quarterly results. The variance in our second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following key items : $40 million variance at Sempra Mexico due to impacts from foreign currency and inflation effects net of foreign currency hedges. This large delta year-over-year was primarily driven by a $34 million benefit in the second quarter of 2018 from a depreciation in the peso compared to a $6 million expense in the second quarter of 2019 from a slight appreciation in the peso. $35 million of lower earnings at Sempra renewables related to assets sold in December of 2018 and April of 2019; $26 million of lower earnings at the California Utilities from lower CPUC base operating margin in 2019, due to the delay in the 2019 GRC decision while absorbing higher operating costs, including higher wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E. As Joe mentioned earlier, any true-up for the 2019 GRC related to adopted revenue requirements and attrition would be recognized in the quarter we receive final CPUC approval retroactive to the beginning of 2019, and $1 million of lower earnings at Sempra Texas utilities. While this is a small variance it was mainly due to Oncor's acquisition of InfraREIT net the transaction costs recorded during the quarter, which was offset by higher consumption in the second quarter of 2018 primarily driven by weather. These items were offset by $22 million of higher earnings from our discontinued operations in South America mainly from higher tariffs; lower cost purchase power in Peru; and including $10 million of lower depreciation expense in both countries due to assets classified as held for sale; $19 million of higher earnings at Sempra LNG from our marketing operations primarily driven by optimization of natural gas transport contracts related to our ongoing businesses and LNG development projects; and $12 million of higher earnings at SDG&E from increased investments in Electric Transmission operations. I'd now like to take a moment to discuss some potential financial impact we expect as a result of the wildfire legislation that Joe mentioned earlier. We plan to fund SDG&E's initial share of the wildfire fund with the contribution from Sempra Energy. Sempra Energy does not anticipate issuing any new equity to fund this. And given the size of the contribution, we expect minimal negative impacts to our credit metrics in exchange for a material improvement in the overall risk profile of SDG&E and Sempra Energy. Additionally, we along with the other California IOUs are currently evaluating the accounting treatment of these contributions. And we expect a resolution to this in the third quarter. Please turn to slide 11. Over the last year, we laid out a strategy to grow at scale. It was a 3-part plan that involved, focusing on, a smaller number of high-growth, high-impact markets, recycling capital from lower- to higher-return businesses and executing across all platforms with discipline and focus. We also continue to add to the strength and depth of our management team, and will remain focused on delivering our financial commitments. The reaffirmation of our adjusted EPS guidance range reflects all of this, as well as our continued confidence in the strategic plan. With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks. And start to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good afternoon. Jeff Martin : Good afternoon, Greg. Greg Gordon : A couple of questions, first, there were some audit that recently around the Cameron project, because of the action in McDermott's share price after they reported their financial results. So, I think you know the project is pretty much on the verge of being complete now. And you've given them new incentive payments. I also think, you have some protections for some reason even though we're in the end game here they fail to commercially complete the project in terms of letters of credit in such. Can you talk about your comfort level with the ability to get the project completed on the current schedule? And what the contingencies will be, if you can in this very late stage, if they fail to complete it? Jeff Martin : Greg. Thanks for that question. Obviously, we spent a little bit of time in our prepared remarks, talking about the progress we're having right now in Train 1. There's a term of ours in the contract referred to as substantial completion, which we're expecting for Train 1 in the next day or so. And that trigger is really the commencement of revenues, which we referenced this commercial operations in the middle of the month. So, you're raising a couple good points. As we get further along, in the development of the project the, risk that you're talking about actually diminish in terms of time and exposure. And then to your point, there's been no change in terms of the expected completion dates for Trains 2 and 3. The contract amendments that you reference also provide the appropriate incentives. I think that calls us to have more certainty with respect to that schedule. But perhaps, Joe, you can provide some additional color relative to the contract \u2026 Joe Householder : \u2026Yeah. Jeff Martin : \u2026relationship. Joe Householder : Thanks Jeff. Hi. Greg. Yeah look I feel very confident about this. You mentioned the amendment. And I think that gives them a lot of incentive to earn these performance-based payments by continuing. They're making really great progress and the plants running really well. So all that's, good, as there's very positive momentum at the site. Obviously, their stock price took a hit. But I think that's focused on other things and didn't really change the financial condition of the company itself. I think you mentioned a couple of things. We do have letters of credit that backup the contract. And we feel comfortable with what those are. And as you recall, we have joint several liability between the two contracting partners. And Sharyland, just received a large influx of capital from Mitsubishi and MUFG. So, I think I feel really good about it. Obviously, I don't like to see that happening to one of our working members. But it's been a little bit tough for them. But they continue to get great big contracts from very large multinational oil companies. So I think people have conviction, that they'll make it. Greg Gordon : Okay. A couple more questions. In terms of what's going on in Mexico I know, there's some opacity there. Is the government there concerned about the force majeure payments that have been made for pipelines that have not been delivering gas? Or are they also in addition to being unhappy about the force majeure payments asking for fundamental redesign of the underlying contract structure of those agreements, between the pipelines and CFE? Jeff Martin : Greg thanks for the question. You'll recall, there's about, seven pipelines down there that have -- in disputes with CFE. Two of those impact pipelines, two of the 14 that we own in Mexico. And the answer to your question is the former. The conversations have been focused specifically on the force majeure provisions. And you'll recall that the Sonora pipeline is not currently in operation due to the Ocu tribe has interrupted our service. And although, that we've completed the Marine Pipeline it has not been placed in service yet as part of these discussions. But Joe, perhaps you can provide some additional color on the Mexico situation. Joe Householder : Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Yeah. Greg, look I wanted to start out by saying, your team here at Sempra is very engaged with our colleagues in Mexico City on these issues. George and I were actually just in Mexico last week. And we're working with Carlos and Tania. We met with several parties to continue our advocacy for a resolution of these matters. It's a really a commercial dispute around two of these pipelines, two of our 14 pipelines. Each of those pipelines as Jeff said is complete. But these are fully legal contracts that were developed by the CFE in the auction. So we feel good about our ability to continue to work with them. And we are in pretty much a daily basis working with them to try to resolve what I view as a commercial difference of opinion. But they've approved these force majeure payments. And when we went to them with what the force majeure reason was they approved that and approved the payments and now they're asking that to be reevaluated. Jeff Martin : I'd also mentioned Greg, I think that we're fairly optimistic that we think there's a time line in front of us where we can move through this relatively quickly. And I think all the signals have been from the government that they share our interest in resolving this quickly. So I think there's an alignment of interest and we're hopeful that we can make some progress in the near term. Greg Gordon : Great. My final question is on the accounting for the wildfire fund payments, the initial contribution and the ongoing contributions. You indicated you're working with the other utilities in the states to figure out where\u2019s the countrymen [ph]. I mean are the two options that they're either considered -- you can charge-off both the initial contribution and the future contributions. And -- or is there a potential for -- because of these meeting payments that send out for an extended -- for nine more years on an annualized basis that that would be an item that would be considered to GAAP operating non-recoverable expense? Or to sum up the question, what are the different potential outcomes here and how should we think about that? Jeff Martin : Right. And I'm -- we feel a little bit apologetic. We wish we could give you a really clean answer as to what the appropriate accounting treatment would be. You're absolutely right in your assessment they work increasingly with our colleagues to the North and their respective audit firms to make sure that we get the right approach here. But Trevor perhaps you could give Greg some color around the options that are being currently reviewed. Trevor Mihalik : Sure Jeff. Hey Greg. Yeah, so one of the things we're doing is, like Jeff said, we're working with the others just because you need to have consistency across all three entities because it's really the same transaction. And so what we're looking at is working through that with them and then ultimately getting it through the two different audit firms that DNT audits us and PG&E and then PWC on Edison. But what you're really asking is could this be an expense or does this really meet a definition of an asset from a GAAP basis. And if it meets the definition of an asset from a GAAP basis then how does that get unwound off your balance sheet. And so we're working through all of that right now, but it really comes down to can you expense it immediately, or do you to have to hold it up on your balance sheet and then unwind it either through some kind of an actuarial assumption or over some period of time that it would come off your balance sheet. And that's really just for the initial contribution. Greg Gordon : And for the ongoing expense? Trevor Mihalik : Same thing. Sorry, the initial contribution in the ongoing expense and then you've got the other piece of the legislation, which is the contribution to the mitigation investments. That's now $215 million and that really then ultimately is really part of our ongoing wildfire expense capital, but you just don't get an equity return on the capital but you do get a return of that as well as the associated financing costs. So really the 322 and the 13 is, do we expense that immediately on a 322 and then expense the 13 each year? Or do you capitalize and put it on your balance sheet as an asset and then unwind that over some period of time. And all of that's being worked on and we will come up with an answer before the third quarter because we're recording it in the third quarter. Greg Gordon : Gentlemen thank you. Peter Wall : Greg, this is Peter. Just to add on to what Trevor said. Kind of the third alternative there is an event based treatment, so we would hang it up as an asset. And then should we or one of the other IOUs have an event and a determination was made by the CPUC in terms of recoverability whether or not that was expensed at that time. Greg Gordon : I see. Okay, thank you. Have a great day. Peter Wall : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Next we will hear from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Constantine Lednev : Hi, good morning. It's actually Constantine here for Shar. Just thinking about you didn't mention any updates on the South America sales, so I guess the first part is, is there any updates that you have there? Do you have any tentative schedule in mind yet? Or is the process still ongoing? And the follow-up within that is thinking about the post South America sale Sempra, are you planning to update kind of the dilution guidance numbers or somewhere after the close or around the third quarter? Or is that going to be reserved a little bit more for when a lot of these other items start coming to fruition like the GRC in California, all the regulatory proceedings, Texas updates deleveraging et cetera? Jeff Martin : Thank you for that question. We've laid out a strategy that Trevor described in his prepared remarks where we're trying to refocus the business around higher growth markets where we think we can produce the biggest financial impacts. At the same time that we're moving our investment strategy where we can from lower return to higher-return investments and then trying to execute with more discipline. And with that context the South American transaction is really important to us. It gives us a chance to basically recycle capital out of South America directly into our North American strategy, strengthen our balance sheet and support our $25 billion capital program. What we traditionally do as the convention would be to update our 2020 guidance on our Q4 call in February and you raised a number of really important points. And I think it does put some context to this quarter. We just produced $3.03 of adjusted earnings in the first half of the year relative to the prior period in 2018 where it was closer to $2.78. So we've been able to produce roughly 9% growth rate year-over-year. That does not include the benefits from the recently closed InfraREIT transaction. It doesn't include any potential uplift from the GRC or the cost of capital. And you will note that we have not been recording the -- any benefit from an attrition increase year-over-year as part of the GRC. And finally we noted on the call that we expect Cameron to start producing revenues in the middle part of the month. So again, that's another portion of uplift that's not captured in the first half. So those are all some strong positives going into 2020. And based upon the South American sale when we have those definitive numbers that will go into that overall assessment of how we think about 2020. But certainly based upon the results from the first half of the year, we feel good about being at $3.03. And we'd able to have closed the InfraREIT transaction and have now visibility of the first train producing revenues in the middle of the month with the GRCs hopefully with the proposed decision in the coming weeks. We think we're very well set up to provide really good visibility going into 2020. But I'll stop there. We have a new member of our team that many on the call may recognize. George Bilicic has spent a better part of 20 years as the Vice Chairman of Lazard handling mergers and acquisitions and engagements, supporting good governance at Boards. We're very pleased to have him part of our team. And he's actually leading and stepped into the South American transaction with Dennis and Trevor on the team. I thought George perhaps you could speak to the current state of that transaction on an going-forward basis. George Bilicic : Thanks, Jeff. And what I'd say about the process is we're right in the middle of a very competitive sales process. We've received robust interest in these assets. They're obviously a very unique and rare collection of assets with a strong underlying investment thesis for potential new owners of the business. We're again in the middle of the process. We would be anticipating announcing the winning bidder toward the end of the third quarter of this year or early in the fourth quarter. Constantine Lednev : Perfect. Yes that's a very thorough answer. Thank you for that. Just kind of following up on kind of the Cameron side and I've noted a couple of remarks that were from the McDermott call and that kind of the performance milestone bonuses are kind of forthcoming. So that kind of -- that seems to bode well for completion there. But also thinking about the site and if you talked about the expansion at the Trains 4 and 5 while Port Arthur and ECA kind of both have an FID time line how are you thinking about the development at the site for 4, 5 kind of between the existing partnership having interest and any kind of analysis and parallel path that can go on with development there? Jeff Martin : Thank you for that question. And I think there's also an opportunity will not stop to let Joe kind of update on some of the expansion opportunities at Port Arthur. But we remain very excited about Cameron expansion. I think the relationship with Total as an anchor tenant has been really important to us. It's a relationship that we've invested in. I'm actually going on a marketing trip to Europe in the next couple of weeks. I think, Joe and his team with Carlos and others are expected to be going on another trip to Asia. So we feel good about the marketing work that's taking place. Joe cited in his prepared remarks the 17 million tons per annum that we've signed up under some form of agreement in the last 10 months to 12 months. But Cameron too is an interesting opportunity right? Cameron was built as a Brownfield site initially. We think the expansion opportunity makes a lot of sense for our partners. It's certainly something that Total has been quite constructive on and we're continuing to process now a study with our fellow partners about that expansion. I think it continues to look like something that is a that we feel is we're optimistic about. But Joe perhaps you can provide some color on both including the developments at Port Arthur. Joe Householder : Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, I think, I've mentioned before on prior calls that the partners are working -- looking very hard at the expansion project. Our focus is clearly on getting Cameron Trains 1, 2, 3 into operation. And we're right at the date of getting Train 1 into operation and start earning. So Trains 2 and 3 are progressing well. So it is time for us to be at this point where we're studying with our partners, the ability to move that project forward and it has all the FERC approvals and everything. So as Jeff said we're encouraged about that. On Port Arthur, we're really encouraged about having about two-thirds of it either under contract with Poland or in the HOA with Aramco Services. And so that project has a really high focus in our team to fill out the necessary commercial agreements so that we can move that project forward. And we're getting a lot of positive interest and that in part caused us to go to the FERC and file for two additional trains that create the potential for 27 MTPA at Port Arthur. And we requested authority of FERC to site and construct that by January 2021. So that's all important. And I would say, we're also really advancing our work with Bechtel on the engineering work at Port Arthur. So we're pretty excited about what's going on. Constantine Lednev : Wonderful. That's really helpful color. Thank you very much. Joe Householder : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, good afternoon. Jeff Martin : Hey, Julien, how are you doing? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Thank you. So perhaps just to kick it off in the prepared commentary you mentioned Mexico and the peso. Just to clarify here what you meant by that if the peso remains at its current levels, do you feel comfortable with your current guidance range? I know mentioned in the remark's that it could impact your 2019 guidance. Just want to clarify that at the outset here. Jeff Martin : Yeah. Yeah, I don't think there's much to read-through there. I think we affirmed our guidance for 2019 and what we called out was we still have two rate cases to follow through on and three cost of capital, two here in the state and one at FERC. And obviously, as you can see just in the quarter-over-quarter results FX does change from time-to-time. So we're just calling that out as another factor that will have some impact to the second half of the year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then separately, if I can go back to the cost of capital side of that equation since you just mentioned it the move the equity cap ratio upwards from 52 to 56 potentially. Can you elaborate a little bit on the process there and your confidence level of making that happen? Obviously, one of your peers seems to have made moves around that already. But I would be curious, if you have any comments. Jeff Martin : I appreciate the question. I think we noted in our remarks that the PUC laid out a scoping memo that puts us on a path to get to final cost of capital decisions by the end of the year Julien. Our utility was actually updated yesterday so filed comments on the cost of capital were filed yesterday. SDG&E requested 12.83%. SoCalGas has Julien remained unchanged at 10.7% I think you'll find is a fairly tight range of filings. I think PG&E is now at 12% and Edison is at 11.5% -- 11.45%. So I think the three electric utilities are in the 40 to 90 BP range with each other. And we're already at the 56% level from the equity standpoint at SDG&E and that's exactly what we filed for was 56%. But I would also mention, the process we use we've used the exact same industry experts that we've used on prior cost of capital filings. We went through a process with them to develop rational economic models that form the basis of our initial filing and that was before the AV 1054 legislation. And after that legislation passed, we went back to the same folks updated those models. And consistent with the underlying assumptions that were published around the AV 1054 that really led to our revised comments yesterday where we adjusted our number to 12.38%, as our request for SDG&E. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Last quick detail, 2020 guidance affirming that here? Jeff Martin : We as a convention Julien \u2013 that's a good question. We as a convention do not affirm forward guidance. We did on \u2013 actually as an aberration we did that on our Q1 call largely, because you recall that we had changed the schedule for Trains 2 and 3 and taken a lot of investor interest in that. So we reaffirmed that on the last call. There's no look through issue here. And just as a matter of convention we don't talk about our forward guidance on every call. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Appreciate it. All the best. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot Julien. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Just on the \u2013 first on the LNG growth projects could you maybe just give a little more color on milestones that we should be watching to the end of the year to watch for? And then, I guess also along with that have you seen much of an impact from the lower commodity environment in terms of customer interest how are they kind of looking through that? Jeff Martin : Thanks for the question, Steve. I'll start with the second question first. Obviously, the spot market for LNG has been trending lower. There's a lot of discussion of that in the marketplace, and there are folks that are influenced by the shorter part of that curve. But most of the folks, we're talking about they understand that there needs to be additional capacity built. They understand that the United States has not only the lowest-priced access to natural gas largely because so much of this is associated gas, Steve. We've got lower volatility and deep capital markets. So more capacity has to get built and that capacity will be built based on long-term contracts. So we have not seen any material impact to the marketing discussions, we're having just because the spot market really for LNG is low at this time. In terms of the milestones to think about particularly as we focus on ECA 1, we're still targeting trying to get that completed by the end of the year in terms of a final investment decision. There's three things we're focused on, number one, taking our existing three counterparties from the heads of agreement to a definitive SPA. Number two, filing for and getting our export permit to move gas off the West Coast to Mexico. And finally, we've got some more work to do to finalize our EPC contract. But that's really the focus as we think about now and year-end. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then just totally separate question back in California I would be interested in your thoughts on the new president of the CPUC and just given the focus on PUC reform and Governor Newsom's focus there just any sense on what you see maybe being done differently going forward? Jeff Martin : Thank you. I would start by saying that I personally have not spent a lot of time with Governor Newsom prior to him stepping into his new role. I think members of our Board members of our management team myself included we have been very impressed with the leadership he's shown in the last six months together with leadership from the legislature. So think about the fire experiences we had as a state Steve in 2017 and 2018. The big effort that we made last year to get to SB 901 and to have the issues that have developed in the state since then and really to see a new governor step in and kind of galvanize the type of political support that was necessary to deliver this was really, really important. I would also say he is very focused on ensuring that we have a good regulatory environment and that there are needed reforms at the commission. I think the naming of the new president has been important. We certainly enjoyed Michael Picker's reign over the last six plus years, but she has a noted reputation as a reformer. She's been very successful in the prior roles that she's had in the state and outside the state. I have not had the chance to meet with her, but folks who know her personally hold her in very high regard. So we're quite optimistic not only that, this new legislation helps move us back toward a premium regulatory marketplace, but we're also very pleased with the new leadership that's taking place at the commission. Steve Fleishman : Thank you. Operator : And next we will hear from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Question about Port Arthur. When you -- it seems like you're getting closer to an FID decision on Port Arthur. And it's exciting that you're going to potentially upsize this. When you first took Cameron 1, 2, 3 FID you gave out disclosure and you've updated that over time about the EBITDA and earnings impact potentially for Cameron 1 2 3. I know it's still a little bit early, but if you do have some of the contracts in hand, how should we think about the economics of Port Arthur relative maybe on $1 per train basis or $1 per Bcf day basis relative to the economics of Cameron now that we're seven or eight years down the road? The world's becoming more competitive with more LNG, more folks building liquefaction in the U.S. How should we think about the returns on that type of project the earnings and EBITDA impact relative to the size and scale and compared to what you did with Cameron? Jeff Martin : Michael I think there's a lot of questions embedded in that. I probably cannot give you the definitive detail you're looking for. I can say that we're pleased at this point to have close to 70% of the contracts in hand. We have a lot more work to be done to finalize the additional customers that we need. Believe it or not, that site is expandable to eight trains. It could be upwards to 45 million tons per annum. And certainly that's not currently within the contemplation of our near-term ambition. But it's a great site. I think having Saudi Aramco as an anchor tenant there was a huge development for our company. And obviously, they're also expected to be a 25% stakeholder. So having them involved will be a real resource to us not just on the engineering side, but how we approach financing that project. As we move through what we have internally as a 10-point report card for FID both at ECA one and Port Arthur, one of the things we're doing now is working through the issues you're describing in terms of making sure we're hitting the right hurdle rates and we have the right expectations relative to cash flows. But it's something as we move forward that project that we commit to come back to you with Michael with more detail in the future. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then my next question I know especially if you move forward with Port Arthur ECA you'll have a very capital intensive budget for the coming years on good growth projects. But Jeff, how are you generally thinking about M&A whether it's U.S. utilities or whether it's other? And to be honest, how does the integration of Oncor into the portfolio impact your view of future bolt-on acquisitions? Jeff Martin : Great question. I tell you we have had a very active M&A team at our company for the better part of 15 years. And typically Michael it was focused really on project level acquisitions which I think we developed quite a bit of expertise around. The Oncor transaction was one that we probably had studied in terms of what we received in California and the type of markets that we found most attractive. I think it's one of the reasons that we were able kind of move relatively quickly, when we had to make that transaction happen. And by the way, we cannot be more pleased with that. I think you were able to attend our analyst conference this spring. Alan laid out one of the best high visibility growth projections for that business that I've seen since I've been at Sempra. And by the way, to be able to come behind that and extend that Texas platform with InfraREIT has been a real plus for us. So, I'm really excited about the Texas market generally. I'm excited about the backlog in the interconnection queue there in ERCOT and the need for more generation to be built given some of the relatively low reserve margins. So, that platform is something that we have high optimism about. We typically don't talk about as a convention forward M&A. But clearly Texas continues to be a market of interest for us and we are very excited about the continued outperformance relative to what we thought Oncor could do. And you've seen us raise that capital plan now three or four times including now updating it for the InfraREIT transaction. So stay tuned. We'll continue to focus on our $25 billion capital program. We have a lot in front of us and we feel great about what's been taking place in Texas. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jeff. Much appreciated. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Michael. Operator : And our next question will come from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good morning guys. Jeff Martin : Hi Sophie. Sophie Karp : Hi, I wanted to just Hi, confirm something on the Mexico pipeline dispute right? Could you confirm that this issue is contained to the force majeure payments? Or is that a broader scope there maybe concerning the ongoing tariff? Jeff Martin : Yes, there was a similar question earlier. I would say that a couple of things are important to confirm. One is we have 14 pipelines in Mexico. As you know we've got re-gas facilities in LDCs. We've got solar wind facilities. We've got refined product storage. This is really contained to two contracts out of the 14 pipelines. And the focus of the conversations have been around the force majeure payments largely because both of those pipelines have not been in operation. But keep in mind these were contracts that were sourced as part of a competitive bid process. These are contracts that were put forward by CFE for their bidders to sign. And based upon how those contracts are written relative to the force majeure provisions, CFE has been making payments against those force majeure requirements since the force majeure have been occurred. So, to answer your question specifically, yes, the focus of the conversation is around reforming the force majeure provisions in both of those contracts. Sophie Karp : Got it. And then also should we think about this issue as more or less intertwined with your process of obtaining the export permits for your terminal there? Jeff Martin : No, I don't think there's any read-through there. I mean look the new president down there has set a variety of goals about what he wants to do with that country. He wants it to be safer, he wants it to be more fair, he wants to raise the standard of living of all the Mexican people. And you think about how we've actually positioned IEnova. We've been down there for over two decades now really with a goal of making the critical infrastructure investments that allow energy to compete, that allows energy prices to be cheaper, that allows energy sources to be more clean. So, we think we have a big role to play and continuing to make progress that's good for the country. Sophie Karp : Got it. And one last one if I may. I want to ask you if are you seeing any impact on any of your businesses from the ongoing trade war and trade disputes between the U.S. and China. Maybe it's on the LNG side or on the kind of construction side any color on that you could give us would be helpful. Jeff Martin : Yes, appreciate the question. We've looked at this from time to time. Obviously, we're in kind of the definitive phase of trying to wrap up our EPC contracts both for ECA and for Port Arthur. But we really see no impact yet on that type of issue. Formerly, when we owned renewable business, it was a type of issue that could impact assertion of panels. But today across our businesses, we really have not felt any material impact relative to those trade issues. Sophie Karp : Thank you. That's all I had. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot Sophie. Operator : And our final question will come from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Yes, hi. Good morning guys and thanks for taking my question. Jeff Martin : Good morning Sunil. Sunil Sibal : Yes, I just wanted to drill a little bit into the contracting construct for the LNG project. I understand that for the Cameron all the contracts were on tolling basis and just wanted to know for this Port Arthur contract are you following the same approach or there is kind of more flexibility on how you're contracting those that plant? Jeff Martin : Joe would you like to respond to that? Joe Householder : Sure. Yes, the tolling model was something that was prevalent in the first construction with our project and a couple others, but it's no longer a model that most customers prefer for a variety of different reasons. And most of them now prefer to have a simple STA model where they're buying LNG either deliver to them or at the birth of the LNG plant. And whether or not that particular customer have gas in North America, they prefer to just separate that activity from the LNG plant. So, it may be the customer and that we have a few of these the customer actually wants to bring gas and sell it to the plant. That's okay with us because our model has a determination of what the price is. The LNG price is based on the gas price. So, we don't care. We know how to buy gas. We bought gas for many of our businesses like when we owned the generation plants and so forth. So, it's fine with us. It's just a little bit different than the tolling model, but effectively we're creating what would almost be like a synthetic toll. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Thanks for that. And does that kind of create a little bit more commodity exposure for you or maybe infrastructure exposure for you upstream? And is that kind of incorporated into your tolling model or your returns on the project? Jeff Martin : Thanks, Sunil. What we try to do is we sat down and looked at the entire value chain for LNG and thought about what parts of that value chain are consistent with what Sempra does every day. For example, like at SoCalGas, where we buy gas and have it shipped to our city gate. And what we determined was that we could basically make a traditional infrastructure investment at the terminal, get long-term contracts and have great visibility and certainty of cash flows. We could also, if needed by customers, contract for gas to be shipped on pipelines to our facility. But in all those cases, we would only do that if we were selling it at an index plus price. So, in other words, the price risk from the index selected by the customer is passed on directly to the customer. And we don't participate in that type of commodity exposure in terms of the volatility that you're asking about. Joe Householder : No upstream investment. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Got it. And then just one more on the Cameron incentive payments that you did with McDermott. So obviously McDermott has revealed $110 million of payments for Train 1 and maybe part of that price to Train 2 and 3 also. So I just wanted to understand that how much more of those kind of incentive payments could be there, if you can talk about that in more specificity. Is there an order of magnitude we should think about in terms of those payments? Joe Householder : Thank you. This is Joe. I'll just say this. We did not make the provision for that amendment public. So McDermott did say that on their call relative to what they had collected. And it's effectively mostly work -- milestone payments that they got from work on Trains 2 and 3, not on Train 1. And we're not going to tell you the number -- the total number. But I can tell you what's most important from a Sempra point of view, it doesn't materially impact our IRR from the project nor our earnings forecast that we've given you. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Joe Householder : Appreciate Sunil. Operator : And I will now turn the call back over to Jeff Martin for closing remarks. Jeff Martin : I just want to close by expressing our appreciation for everyone who joined us this morning. If you have any follow-up questions per custom, please feel free to reach out to our IR team. We hope each of you have a great day. Operator : And that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And at this time, I would like to turn things over to Faisel Khan. Please go ahead, sir. Faisel Khan : Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter 2019 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego, several members of our management team, including Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; George Bilicic, Group President; and Peter Wall, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and it will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 1st, 2019, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Joe. Joe Householder : Thanks Faisel and thank all of you for joining us today. Normally, Jeff would lead this call, but he and Dennis are currently traveling overseas for our LNG business, meeting with current and future partners and customers. So, I'll be filling in for him today. I'll start off by saying that this quarter's strong operational and financial results reflect our company's focus on execution and demonstrate progress towards our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. I'll provide a more detailed business update later in the presentation. But our recent accomplishments include placing Cameron LNG Train 1 and the project shared facilities into service, while also advancing commission and construction of the two remaining trains, reaching a constructive resolution with the CFE in relation to our two pipelines in Mexico and placing the marine pipeline into service, receiving a constructive general rate case final decision at SDG&E and SoCalGas, with a focus on safety and reliability; progressing the sale of our South American businesses by announcing sales agreements for both Peru and Chile; increasing the CapEx plan at the Texas utilities to keep up with the continued growth Oncor is seeing in and around its service territory; and finally, continuing to progress our LNG development projects as highlighted by the recent MoU announcement with Mitsui. In sum, it's been a remarkable year for our company. All of the positive regulatory, legislative, and operational developments we've recognized year-to-date give us increased confidence in our financial outlook. With this in mind, we're raising our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance from our previous range of $5.70 to $6.30 and to a new higher range of $6 to $6.50. Additionally, based on California Utilities' 2019 GRC final decision, coupled with the announced sales of our South American businesses, we're affirming our full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.70 to $7.50. As we look towards the rest of the year, we remain focused on our strategic goals to help drive shareholder value and benefit all of our stakeholders. Please turn to the next slide. You'll recall that we presented a similar version of this slide at our Investor Day earlier this year. We believe it's worth highlighting again, given the progress we've made in repositioning our portfolio. It's hard to imagine that just last year, we were active in 18 states in United States and three foreign jurisdictions. Now, we've narrowed our focus to three states and one foreign jurisdiction. We believe that we've high-graded our portfolio by exiting our U.S. renewable generation and South American businesses, and replaced them with higher quality T&D earnings. This focused strategy allows us to concentrate on growing our Tier 1 position in some of the most attractive markets in North America, which have strong business fundamentals and meaningful growth opportunities. Please turn to slide six, where I'll review the recent developments related to our South American businesses. We first announced the decision to sell our South American businesses in January of this year, with a view of recycling capital into growth at our utilities and infrastructure businesses and to reduce parent debt. The sales of these businesses represent an important strategic shift for our company and is another example of our ability to effectively optimize our portfolio, while increasing value for our shareholders. The combined sales price of over $5.8 billion reflects the quality of these businesses, and we're very pleased with the results of the sales process to-date. We've laid out a general time line of the transactions on the slide and expect the sales of both our Peruvian and Chilean businesses to be completed in the first quarter of 2020. Before I move on, I would like to recognize George, Trevor, Dennis and the team for a great job getting us to this point in the sales process. I would also like to recognize the wonderful teams in Chile and Peru, run by Francesco and Mile, they have done a fantastic job over the past 20 years and added a lot of value to Sempra. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll discuss some of the recent business updates at SDG&E. I'll first discuss the general rate case. As a reminder, this is the first time that the risk assessment mitigation phase, or RAMP, process was integrated into the GRC. Importantly, this takes into account safety and reliability spending as directed by the California Public Utilities Commission. You'll also recall that the GRC usually represents a sizable portion of our capital plan, but does not capture FERC-related investments or CPUC projects addressed outside the GRC. This proceeding also does not change our utilities authorized cost of capital, which is being addressed in a separate proceeding. Now, let's review the key details of the final decision issued in late September as it relates to SDG&E. Overall, we're pleased with this decision as we believe it fairly balances customer rates and critical investments needed to help ensure the delivery of safe, reliable energy. The decision approved the following for SDG&E. A 2019 test year revenue requirement of $1.99 billion, which represents an increase of approximately $107 million or 5.7% over 2018 authorized revenues as well as overall post-test year revenue requirement attrition rates of 6.7% in 2020 and 4.8% in 2021. It's worth noting that the 2020 and 2021 post-test year attrition amounts for capital investments are significantly higher than the O&M attrition amounts. This is a reflection of our commitment to thoughtfully invest capital related to safety and reliability, while efficiently and effectively managing O&M cost. These increased revenue requirements will support improvements in critical energy infrastructure and risk mitigation. Now, let's turn to the cost of capital proceedings. Regarding the FERC cost of capital, all parties have reached a negotiated resolution and we've submitted an offer of settlement in mid-October. The settlement request an authorized ROE of 10.6%, which includes the 50 basis point CAISO adder. This represents a 55 basis point increase from our currently authorized FERC ROE of 10.05%. We expect the commission to issue an order on this matter in the first half of 2020. For the CPUC cost of capital proceeding, we continue to expect a final decision toward the end of this year. Regarding our initial and ongoing contributions to the California Wildfire Fund, we are expensing the total contributions over the estimated period of benefit, which we estimate to be approximately 10 years and we would record additional charges if a wildfire event occurs and the fund is reduced. Please turn to the next slide. I'd now like to take a moment and address the recent wildfire situation across the state. Our thoughts are with the first responders, firefighters, residents, and the broader communities being impacted by these terrible events. Importantly, wildfire safety and risk mitigation are a top priority for us within our service territory. And we continue to be vigilant, monitoring weather patterns and potential wildfire threats, while remaining engaged with our customers and communities in order to maintain critical lines of communication. As a reminder, investing in wildfire mitigation is not something new for our company. In fact, we've invested approximately $1.5 billion in related efforts over the past decade. This includes deploying the most highly concentrated weather station network in the U.S., installing over 100 high-definition cameras across our service territory, replacing over 21,000 wood poles or steel poles, developing weather and fire models based on years of collected data, allowing us to forecast potential weather events several days in advance and fire hardening approximately 75% of our electric transmission lines with a goal to fire harden the remaining 25% over the next few years. Another example is our Fire Safe 3.0 project, which continues to build on our foundation of industry-leading mitigation efforts and includes utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve situational awareness, introducing a new vegetation risk index, enabling satellite wildfire alerts, and improving our unprecedented weather data network with high-speed capabilities. In combination, these items should further enhance our ability to deliver safe and reliable energy to the communities we serve. This is just a glimpse of the type of project highlights we'll be providing at our Investor Day next year. Now, please turn to slide nine, where I'll discuss developments at SoCalGas. The recent final decision in the GRC also marked the first time, the RAMP process was integrated for SoCalGas. It approved the following : a 2019 test year revenue requirement of $2.77 billion, which represents an increase of approximately $314 million or 12.8% over 2018 authorized revenues as well as overall post-test year revenue requirement attrition rates of 7.9% in 2020 and 5% in 2021. Similar to SDG&E, SoCalGas' 2020 and 2021 post-test year attrition amounts related to capital substantially outpaced O&M. The increase in the revenue requirement related to capital and corresponding increase to rate base should enable us to make critical investments in our infrastructure system around safety and reliability for the benefit of our customers. An example of this is the continued support for SoCalGas' pipeline safety enhancement plan, and notably, the GRC approved 32 PSEP projects, plus 284 valve enhancement plan projects over the next three years. Now, please turn to slide 10, where we'll talk about Texas. The macro and business environment in Texas remains one of the strongest in the U.S., and Oncor recently announced another increase to their already substantial five-year capital plan, as shown by the chart on this slide. The increase is mainly related to the growth in and around Oncor service territory with growth CapEx accounting for about two-thirds of this capital plan. Importantly, these infrastructure investments will help facilitate renewables integration in Texas, keep up with the growth in West Texas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and strengthen and expand the grid for the benefit of Oncor's customers and the communities it serves. Accounting for this increase, they now plan on spending approximately $11.9 billion over the 5-year period between 2020 and 2024. Oncor is clearly a great example of focusing our portfolio on attractive growing markets. Please turn to slide 11, where I'll discuss Sempra LNG. This past quarter had some notable accomplishments at our LNG business. Specifically, we placed Cameron Train 1 in service and continued to progress our LNG development projects. I'd now like to discuss the Cameron LNG project in a little more detail. Specifically, I'd like to highlight that the two companies, Chiyoda and McDermott, that collectively make up our EPC contractor, are joint and severally liable. So, if one is unable to perform its duties, the other is required to complete the project. Both Chiyoda and McDermott, along with their subcontractors, continue to be on-site and active in the project. We remain confident about the Cameron LNG project schedule. Train 1 and the project's shared facilities are already in service, and Train 2 has begun its commissioning process. In fact, Cameron LNG estimates that the project is over 96% complete. Additionally, the schedule for Trains 2 and 3 remain unchanged. Switching to our other LNG projects, we've recently begun limited site activities at Port Arthur and our teams continue to advance discussions with interested customers for the remaining facility capacity. Based on the current project schedule, we're targeting an FID on Port Arthur around mid-2020. At ECA Phase 1, we plan on reaching FID in Q1 2020, a bit later than our year-end target. Overall, the project continues to make progress, and we're taking some extra time to evaluate EPC proposals from two highly qualified bidders. We believe this process will help drive the long-term value of the project to Sempra and its shareholders. Please turn to slide 12. At Sempra LNG, we're committed to advancing our LNG development projects. This slide is a great representation of how active our LNG marketing team has been and the resulting MOUs, HOAS, and SPA that we've been able to secure through these efforts. It's also a positive reflection of the quality of these projects and the confidence in our ability to develop them. A good example of this is the recent MOU with Mitsui. The MOU contemplates Mitsui's potential purchase of up to one-third of the available capacity at Cameron Phase 2 as well as the potential offtake of approximately 1 million tons per annum of LNG and equity participation in ECA Phase 2. As I mentioned earlier, Jeff isn't on the call today, because he's traveling overseas with Dennis Arriola for our LNG business, meeting with current and future partners and customers. This is a great example of how these marketing efforts have significant participation at the highest levels of our organization. Our management team realizes our LNG business is a large contributor to the company's projected growth. With this in mind, we're focusing on bringing our LNG development projects to fruition and securing binding offtake agreements in order to help meet global energy demand and deliver value to our shareholders. Please turn to the next slide, and we'll go over developments in Mexico. Mexico continues to be an attractive market for us with substantial growth opportunities premised on energy accessibility, reliability and emissions goals. At Sempra Mexico, IEnova continues to execute on infrastructure projects in Mexico that should help it provide increased affordability and accessibility to cleaner, more reliable energy for its rapidly growing population. Notably, the team recently reached a resolution with CFE regarding the Guaymas-El Oro and Marine pipelines and subsequently put the marine pipeline in service in mid-September and announced the border solar project, which is contracted with high-quality counterparties. I'd also like to highlight that given these developments and expected positive momentum, IEnova recently raised its dividend by approximately 5%. Now, let me turn the call over to Trevor, who will review our financial results, beginning with Slide 14. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks Joe. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $813 million or $2.84 per share. This compares favorably to third quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $274 million or $0.99 per share. On an adjusted basis, the third quarter 2019 earnings were $425 million or $1.50 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $339 million or $1.23 per share. Please turn to slide 15, where I'll discuss the key drivers of our quarterly results. The variance in our third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following key items : $34 million of lower earnings at Sempra Renewables related to assets sold in December of 2018 and April of 2019; $24 million of lower earnings at SDG&E from electric transmission operations, primarily due to a FERC formulaic rate adjustment benefit in 2018; and $14 million of lower earnings at Sempra LNG, primarily due to lower earnings from our marketing operations, mainly driven by changes in natural gas prices. This was offset by Cameron Train 1 commencing commercial operations in August of 2019. These items were offset by $60 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities from higher CPUC base operating margin authorized in 2019, predominantly driven by the GRC final decision. Please note that our year-to-date results reflect the additional $196 million retroactive benefit from the GRC final decision for the first 6 months of the year. $58 million of higher equity earnings at the Sempra Texas Utility segment due to impacts of Oncor's acquisition of InfraREIT. Higher distribution revenues resulting from an increase in volumes driven primarily by weather and higher transmission revenue driven by rates, and $38 million of variance at Sempra Mexico due to impacts from foreign currency and inflation effects, net of foreign currency hedges. This large delta year-over-year was primarily driven by an $11 million benefit in the third quarter of 2019 from a depreciating peso compared to $27 million of expense in the third quarter of 2018 from an appreciating peso. Please turn to the next slide. We're pleased to say that this was a very successful quarter, both operationally and financially. We're continuing to execute on our goals and are progressing our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. In line with this, as Joe previously indicated, we are raising our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range and affirming our full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range, driven primarily by the constructive GRC decision at our California Utilities as well as the robust proceeds expected from the announced sale of our South American businesses. These proceeds should allow us to pay down parent debt and fund growth at our U.S. Utility and Infrastructure businesses. Importantly, we remain focused on achieving our goals, including maximizing long-term shareholder value. Before we open it up to Q&A though, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank Joe for his invaluable contributions to the company. As most of you know, Joe will be retiring soon. He has played an integral role in the growth and progression of our businesses during his nearly two-decade career at Sempra Energy. We'll all miss him and we wish Joe and his family, the very best in his retirement. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : My first question is on the FERC settlement, does that mean that you and the other parties to the case have all agreed on that number and are submitting it for approval? And if so, who are the parties that have agreed that, that's a fair return for your FERC assets? Trevor Mihalik : Hi Greg, yes, thanks for the question. Yes, this settlement means that all the parties have agreed to push this forward and let the FERC make a final decision on this. We expect that final decision to occur in the first quarter. At this point, there are some proceedings that will take place in November. But all the parties to the case, and I don't have them all at my fingertips, but we can get you those if that's important to you. But everybody has agreed to go forward with these numbers. So, that's what we would expect to get pushed out in the first of the year. Greg Gordon : The CPUC is a party, correct? Trevor Mihalik : Yes. Greg Gordon : Thank you. My next question is the wildfire amortization, are you guys assuming that, that is going to be amortized through ongoing earnings? Or are you going to consider that a non-operating item because yesterday or the day before on Edison's call, they indicated they would be considering that a non-operating item for earnings reporting purposes? Joe Householder : Yes. Thank you, Greg for that question. I'll speak to it at first, and then I'll probably have Trevor add to that. I think first, I would say you have to recognize that there is a pretty significant difference in the amounts that we each contributed based on the size of our territory and all the work we've done over the last decade. And doing all the work we needed to do, the risk view was that our contribution was lower. And so it's less material to SDG&E than it was to Southern California Edison and then further less material to Sempra. But we're evaluating that. I did look at what they did. And the way they do core, noncore is probably a little different than we do adjusted earnings. And let me ask Trevor if he has another comment on it. Trevor Mihalik : Yes. Thanks, Joe. Hey Greg. Again, from what Joe said, this is going to be a fairly immaterial amount for us and then we're anticipating it could be about $30 million a year given a 10-year amortization cycle on it. And so we're still looking at it. I think one of the things we probably will do is give prominence to it and try to break it out so that it's very clear, clearly shown on the face of the financials, but we're still evaluating that. But again, from our perspective, we generally do not exclude smaller items, and this would be a recurring item over a 10-year amortization period. So, I think our treatment may be different than Edison's. Greg Gordon : Okay. My last question is this. In reiterating your guidance is a pretty bullish outcome, I think, because the guidance, as it was set, included the earnings from Chile and Peru. And so basically, what you're telling us is pulling out what was the expected earnings contribution from Chile and Peru, net of the initial savings from deleveraging with the proceeds and the outcome from -- the positive outcome from the rate cases and the CapEx increase in Texas that you've basically be able to offset the removal of those earnings completely, if not almost completely. Is that a fair summary? Joe Householder : Yes. So, thank you, Greg. Look, we've had a remarkable year, as I said in our opening remarks, thus far this year. And the proceeds that we're getting from the South American sale, the tax savings we've had there and a GRC out of this risk RAMP case that is -- that allowed the capital that we need to run the utilities in a safe and reliable manner. All of our businesses are doing well and we're very focused on the strategy and we're very pleased that we're able to maintain the guidance for next year based on the operations, based on the GRC, based on South America, all the elements you mentioned; it's very solid. Greg Gordon : Thank you guys. Congrats. Joe Householder : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Hi good morning. So, just a broad question on California. Obviously, first, congratulations, you've continued to manage the fire season very well for 30 in a row. And -- but it's just been obviously a kind of interesting two weeks in terms for the whole sector and the state. So, maybe just some perspectives on how you're thinking about any changes from the Governor, the commission, how you're managing your shut-off plans, if at all? And anything about the structure of the sector and the state. I'd just be curious how you're taking this all-in? Joe Householder : Thank you, Steve. It's a broad question. I have quite a bit that I'd like to say about it. So, bear with me, probably and I appreciate your comment. We didn't have any significant wildfire, catastrophic fire in our territory. This year, we faced very severe weather conditions, but safety is top of mind across our companies in California and in Texas, where we've had some pretty severe tornadoes. But I want to start out with saying how proud I am and how proud we are of our team at SDG&E. I was actually over there at the emergency operations center the day before yesterday during the peak time, which was sort of between 10 in the morning and noon here. And I've been there many times in non-weather conditions and practice sessions. And that's always interesting, and I'm excited to see it. But seeing them in action, taking immediate decisions as the conditions change, and it's not just the people in that room that room is buzzing and they're all working together really well, but it's all the people in the field. I'm listening to phone calls back and forth about live conditions in the community, allowing the team to really have see on the ground, right? We have all these cameras, but now we have people on the ground and that underground experience, helping them make prudent decisions. I saw them turning off lines based on what was going on, on the ground to save lives and reduce the potential for fire. So, I just want to congratulate our team. I actually ask Caroline Winn, who is the COO at SDG&E to come, and I'm going to ask her to speak about this in a minute, but I want to touch on a couple of other points that you made. Look, I think the Governor did a really good job coming into office; working with the legislature and the company's; resetting the prudency standards, the presumptions; letting the CPUC consider factors within and outside our control; looking at humidity, temperature, wind speed. It's been an incredible difficult couple of weeks. So, we've had a big head start, and -- but we're not stopping. You probably saw our Fire Safe 3.0. We're continuing to innovate. And we will help the others try to catch up, but it's been 10 years of hard work, but we just keep wanting to get better and better. I have to tell you on the power shutoffs, I've advocated to Pedro and others like, you guys have got to, it's the only way you're going to keep people out of harm's way. And I have very strong views on this. We have to do it, okay? I think the Governor believes that we have to do it. The Governor has been very supportive of SDG&E. Power shutoff isn't the first thing we do. It's a tool and we use it when we have to, at the end, when there's no other option. But we're continuing to learn, innovate, the people really care and they are razor focused. It's not any time for newcomers, no time for a bunch of forms to fill out, reviews, debates, the situation is intense, and we're dealing with people's lives and we have to do it, and we know what we're doing, and we've proven that we know what we're doing. It's still a challenge, but I think it's manageable if you get the right processes in place. I want to have Caroline take a minute and explain how the last couple of weeks have been. And, yes, she's in charge of making sure that we're all safe. Caroline Winn : Thanks Joe. Just to give a little context, we're coming off the heels of our fourth Santa Ana Red Flag event of the season. We saw typical wind speeds consistently blowing at 20 to 30 miles per hour and peaking at 60 to 80 miles per hour in our highest elevations during this operational period. I will tell you that our system held up well given the environmental conditions and there were no major fires, as Joe mentioned. Around 25,000 customers in this last event were impacted by the public safety power shutoff, and I'm encouraged with our ability to minimize the customers that are affected as a result of PSPS. Our capabilities have been really enhanced over the last several years as a result of our investments in more precise controls of our PSPS plans. And I would also add that in the last couple of years, we have been focused on refining our customer outreach and communication strategy as well as our operational readiness and response. Just speaking a little bit more about customer outreach. We understand the impact that these outages have on businesses and families. And this is an area that we've been really focused on. And there are 3 areas that I'd just like to mention. The first is a comprehensive and advanced notification to our customers. We don't want our customers surprise, and we want to provide them with complete information so they can make the appropriate plans for their families and businesses. Having said that, the weather conditions can change on a dime and there are circumstances where we may need to turn off the power to customers that we hadn't anticipated. And we're not shy to do so. I would say, two, we have worked on the strategic placement of our community resource centers throughout the community to make sure that they're properly placed and make sure that customers have easy in, easy out access, and they have the information and the amenities that they need. And I'd say, lastly, it's our key to building strategic partnerships. We learned very early on that we can't do this alone. And so in fact, before these events, we had conference calls with our non-profit and community-based organizations so that all customers were notified and had the things they need. I think a good example is before this last event, we partnered with Meals on Wheels and the Red Cross to provide the senior communities affected by this PSPS with the amenities that they would need during these cooler temperatures. So, that's just some examples of the areas, and we continue to refine our plan. We continue to improve what we do and learn from every event that we have. Joe Householder : Thanks Caroline. And Steve, let me just add one more thing because you asked a broad question and one thing I would mention is, as I've watched this and I don't have all the information about the fires up north, where we've had fires in several different territories, not ours, it doesn't appear at this time that the magnitude of those fires will impinge on the fund. So, I think with the $1 billion requirement for insurance, these were large severe fires and our heart goes out to all these people, but it is such that it doesn't appear to me today that, that's impacting the fund. It's tough. And I can tell you, much the way many of you have been with us for 20 years, much the way we used to manage the commodity business, the CEO, myself, we worry about this stuff every day. Jeff was calling me, he's traveling overseas on the LNG business, but he's been calling me and contacting me every day about this. He worries about it every day. I worry. Then we call Kevin, then we call Caroline. We're on top of it. And it's just something that we have to manage, much like people in the Northeast or the Southeast have to manage hurricanes or snow events or whatever. We have to manage this and it's a little bit new for California. California is a mild climate. And generally, we don't have outages. This is a different event, and we're learning to deal with it. Thank you. Steven Fleishman : Great. Great. Thank you. Joe Householder : Welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning or good afternoon. Joe Householder : Hi Julien. Trevor Mihalik : Hey Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. So, guys, I suppose with respect to the proceeds in aggregate from Latin America, I'm curious how you think about the 2020 uses at this point. Obviously, we're hearing you say debt pay down. Obviously, you raised your CapEx here. But just ideally, if we can get a little bit more granular as to how you're thinking about it? And separately, and I know Jeff is not here, how do you think about more strategic uses of this capital given some of the comments on the last call as well? Joe Householder : Thank you, Julien. I'm going to turn this over to Trevor in a minute, but we're really pleased with getting full value for these companies. We've run them well for 20 years, and we're getting the right value, and that's really important. And we've talked about paying down debt. But let me -- let Trevor address your question. You hit on a number of points. And on the very last one, we're not going to talk about M&A kind of activities. But obviously, we're very focused on large capital programs. So, Trevor? Trevor Mihalik : Yes, thanks, Joe. Yes. So, Julien, with the amounts of the proceeds that we'll be getting in the first quarter after tax, it's, call it, roughly between $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. We would be deploying that cash in the short-term over paying down our short-term debt and then realigning the debt portfolio and then as well as having it support the CapEx growth. Certainly, we're seeing increased capital requirements in the California Utilities as a result of the GRC and the RAMP filing. A big portion of that GRC is allocated towards capital around safety and reliability. And then we've also seen an increase in the Texas Utilities with the capital going up there. So, deploying that capital as efficiently as we can. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then maybe if I can pivot very quickly over to the LNG side of the business. Obviously, constructive developments of late, would be curious how you're thinking about public developments? And again, however -- in whatever form that takes through the course of the next year, especially given the update on Port Arthur to mid-next year on FID, what is the outcome? Joe Householder : Sure, sure. Thank you. So, I appreciate the questions. These LNG liquefaction projects are very large, complex and quite competitive. And we are progressing these projects to help unlock North America's energy potential and deliver clean energy across the globe. And I travel around the world a lot as Jeff, and we want to get these projects right for our customers and our investors. And in most of these cases, our customers are also investors in the project. And as we've traveled around, and I was recently in Japan, just been in multiple countries in the last 10 days, we were both at the Cameron, dedication with all of our current partners and customers at Cameron and others, we find them all committed to ensuring the success of these projects and long-term returns. So, I know it feels like it's taking time. But this is just us getting it right. We're highly focused on creating value. And I feel really good about the projects and the team. I wouldn't read anything into this. This is us making sure we get the EPC agreements, get the right contractor, get all the things we need to take FID. We are starting to work on financing for Port Arthur. But our partners also have to get comfortable with the returns and everything. Everybody's working toward it. And so I wouldn't read anything in. These are small months in time when we're talking about four or five-year construction projects and multiple year development projects. We are signing a lot of MOUs, and you see that. Partially, that is, the customers are quite excited about being in some of these projects, and they worry that they're going to get left out and they want to sign something. And so we're signing these things, but we're not quite ready. So, we signed an MOU for Cameron expansion. The partners are moving forward. We've got Total telling us exactly how they think we should do it. We haven't voted on anything yet. We've got the expansion at ECA. We're not ready to take FID on that yet. We don't have all the designs and everything, but people want to have their place and it's important. And so we're making that public. I think as we make progress, we'll try to make -- you guys can see all the FERC things, you see that we're actually in commissioning and Train 2 at Cameron now. It's a little bit harder in the development phase. I think as you see us start to do something like financing work at Port Arthur, you'll see -- you'll get the confidence that we have. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the time guys. Joe Householder : Thanks Julien. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks Julien. Operator : And now we'll take question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. A couple of questions. One on the California Utilities, can you remind us, obviously, you get those GRC step-ups each year for the next several years in EPA, SoCalGas and San Diego Gas & Electric, are those the only CPUC related step-ups you get in these three-year periods? And can you get quantified for us what the FERC transmission step-up will be at SDG&E for 2020? I know a lot of those have already been settled or are part of settlement agreements. Joe Householder : So, a couple of things to address there, Michael. So, what we've addressed here is the impact on 2019 through the third quarter of the rate cases, the affirmation of our 2020 guidance without all the pieces, some of that relating to the confidence we have in the rate cases. There's nothing in there relating to the cost of capital, which we expect to get settled by the end of this year that starts effective next year. So, that will be a component that we would expect to see. I think you'll get more details around all of this at the Investor Day. There are some projects that we do at both companies that are sometimes out of the GRC, we'll lay those out, and you've seen those before. But we'll give you a lot more clarity into 2020 and beyond at the Investor Day. Michael Lapides : Got it. Question-- Joe Householder : Sorry, you asked, on the FERC question -- on the FERC question, that one, we expect to get finalized next year. And we would see a step-up from our current rate to the new rate starting then. Michael Lapides : Got it. And is that new rate -- is that settlement document, a public document with the rate disclosed or the revenue step-up disclosed? Joe Householder : Yes. Michael Lapides : Okay. If it's a public document, what's the step-up? Joe Householder : It's 10.6. Trevor Mihalik : Yes. Retroactive. Joe Householder : Retroactive at the beginning of this June -- I'm sorry, June 2019. Trevor Mihalik : Yes. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. I was thinking more of the dollar-million amount. Sorry. Joe Householder : We haven't published that. Michael Lapides : Okay. Finally, on Cameron, is there a material cost change if you finish Cameron 3 before you've made FID decisions on Cameron 4 and 5? I would think there would be in terms of like releasing crews and sending folks home. I mean you're not that far away from sending crews home because you're not that far away from having Cameron 3 done. I'm just curious how you think about that and how you kind of -- how much that plays a role in the negotiation process and in the planning process with both customers and partners? Joe Householder : Yes, let me speak to that. I mean, first and foremost, all of the partners in Cameron are very focused on getting Trains 2 and 3 finished and into service before we do anything beyond that. So that's a primary goal, and we're getting very close. I mean we're about 96% finished and really Train 2 is in commissioning and 3 not far behind. So, those are almost done, but they still need to finish their commissioning process. Everybody is focused on that. We are still just in the last couple of weeks have kind of honed in on what we think we want to build there. We haven't announced what that is yet. And we are still deciding how we're going to do that. It's undetermined at this point exactly how we're going to do it or who will do it. So, I think you probably remember from a few years ago when we were going to try to do Train 4, we were going to try to do continuous construction. That ship really failed because what's going on right now is doing a lot of electrical work. It's being done by subcontractors and the commissioning is being done mostly by Chiyoda people and some McDermott people. It's not the same people that would get -- go in and start doing pilings again. So, the idea of any kind of continuous construction went away years ago. And so I think, I'd leave it with that. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Joe. Much appreciated guys. Joe Householder : Sure Michael. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks Michael. Operator : And now we'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Joe Householder : Hi Shar. Shar Pourreza : Hey guys, how are you doing? Joe Householder : Good. Shar Pourreza : Let me just follow-up question on LNG and sort of as you're thinking about cash flows as Cameron Trains 1 and 3 continue on pace. But we saw a peer transact and monetize a part of cash flows at a very healthy multiple. So, as you guys sort of think about the existing Cameron 1 and 3, even 4 and 5, ECA, Port Arthur, how do you sort of feel about potentially monetizing some of these cash flows, especially since we just got a pretty healthy public mark? Joe Householder : Well, look, I'm not going to talk about some kind of an M&A sort of transaction, which that isn't a bit of. But I would say this, remember, we already have 50% ownership. We don't own 100%. So, it's a little bit different situation. We clearly have good value. You can see the cash flow, the EBITDA from Cameron. And we've had good value in the company from Cameron for some time now as we've been constructing it. But I would say, we're going to build a pretty large LNG business. And I would think that we are going to use that cash flow to help build both the expansion at Cameron and new projects. So, that's what I would think we would be doing to create value -- to create additional value. We're always open to looking at things like that. But know, we've looked at MLP some time ago, that ship sale. But -- we're always looking at things. I actually think we will wind up using the cash for building our LNG business bigger. Shar Pourreza : Got it, self-fund each other. Okay, that's good. And let me just shift real quick to Texas. Oncor, obviously, it's a very healthy CapEx increase that you guys had. A lot of it was driven on sort of the transmission side. Distribution kind of still remains a little bit modest, totally. At what point can you start to pull forward some of that distribution spend? Should we think about it as an opportunity when transmission spend slows down and you offset with distribution? I mean you obviously have the economic backdrop to support more spending. So, how do we sort of think about the interim mix between distribution and transmission? Joe Householder : Yes, I'll start and then I'll ask Trevor to comment. Look, we're very excited about Oncor and the growth in Texas, and there's a lot to do there. And so I think we're very focused on helping them fund that growth. And Trevor, do you want to speak to the details that he is asking about in transition? Trevor Mihalik : Yes, I think, when we look at this, Shar, the big legs of the stool is really in the growth in Texas are in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex being one of the fastest-growing metroplexes and looking at kind of their 2% premise growth on a year-to-year basis. So that's really kind of on the distribution side. Then you look at the West Texas with the Permian and all what needs to be built out on the transmission side with the Permian. And then the third leg is, there's, call it, close to 100 gigawatts in the queue, which is primarily renewables based. So, you see kind of that slant towards more transmission right now as opposed to the growth that we're seeing in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. But all three legs of the stool, renewables, West Texas and the Permian as well as Dallas are all very, very healthy growth areas for us. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Congrats. Joe Householder : Thank you. Operator : We will now go to a Sophie Karp of KeyBanc. Sophie Karp : Hi good morning. How are you guy doing? Joe Householder : Very well. Thanks. You? Sophie Karp : Okay. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to go back a little bit to the guidance. Clearly, we're very impressive that you're maintaining the guidance despite selling and divest in South America. Maybe, could you help us a little bit to bridge how that's -- how much of that's kind of delta is going to be covered by savings on debt versus maybe incremental earnings from Texas and LNG ramp sort of -- maybe if you could provide a little bit more color on that? Joe Householder : Look, I think that as we were able to finalize the sales agreements for South America, assess the rate case, which just got finalized at the end of September, and look at all of our businesses afresh, we became very confident that our guidance range was still good, despite the sales and that was really good news for us because all the businesses are doing well. We have confidence in Cameron and the California Utilities, Oncor and then the South American proceeds. They all come into play. We're not going to break down segment guidance until we have our Investor Day. So, we'll give you all that detail at that point in time. Trevor Mihalik : Sophie, yes, this is Trevor. I would just add one thing, though, that with the sale of the renewables that you saw earlier, we were able to maintain our guidance as we recycle that capital. And likewise, with the sale of South American recycling net capital coupled with, like Joe said, a constructive rate case, that's really focused on capital around safety and reliability, we feel good that we've been able to recycle capital and maintain guidance. So, a huge positive for us in that respect. Sophie Karp : Yes, yes. And so maybe just to double check, does that assume any particular outcomes in the cost of capital preceding and at the FERC. Trevor Mihalik : No, that's outside of the cost of capital. So, that's not in the specific guidance. But again, it most likely would be within that guidance range. Sophie Karp : Okay. And the FERC settlement? Trevor Mihalik : Same thing. It would be in the guidance range. But it's not specifically included. No assumption on that is built into it right now. Sophie Karp : Got it. And then just to confirm on taxes, the incremental CapEx that you are putting in at Oncor; that would be recoverable through TCOS and DCRFs, correct? Trevor Mihalik : That's right. That's right. Sophie Karp : All right. Thank you. That's all I had. I'll jump back in the queue. Joe Householder : Sophie, thanks. Trevor Mihalik : Thank you. Operator : And we will now go to Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Hey good morning guys. Trevor Mihalik : Good morning. How are you Paul? Paul Patterson : All right. So, just to sort of follow-up on Greg's and Steve's questions. If I understand sort of your answer, it looks like you guys are leaning to basically including an adjusted EPS, the Wildfire amortization? Trevor Mihalik : Yes, let me take that one, Paul. What we're leading to is calling it out prominently probably on the face of the financial statements, but probably not carving it out as a separate adjusted guidance. But again, we're still working through that right now. This quarter, it was pretty small. It was only $6 million of earnings, so we didn't call it out. But again, I think one way or the other; we will show it pretty prominently that people can identify that number on the face of the financial statements. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then with respect to the PSPS that you guys have instituted, how would they compare? I mean, I realize that there are separate and distinct situations in every service territory, et cetera. But as a percentage of customers, and I think you guys said, I think, something in the 100,000 customer range. How does that compare to the number of customers that are being reduced in the service territories to the north? And how long are these people on average being cut off, how long is their power out? Because from our perspective, I mean, obviously, different service territories, different numbers of people, but the reaction to these power shutoffs to the north seem to be rather hostile, which I haven't really -- I've seen complaints about obviously people being disconnected in your area in the past and what have you, but I haven't seen anything to this level if you follow me. I'm just wondering if you could speak to that a little. Joe Householder : Yes, let me take it first, Paul. And then I think I'll have Caroline also address it. It's quite interesting and I alluded to this earlier, I've lived in different parts of the country and seen power go out for a variety of reasons, generally, weather events, right? You have planned outages; those are usually generally very short in term. But I've seen weather events across the Eastern seaboard. And nobody likes it, but it happens. And if there's ice and snow or wind knocks trees down and knocks the lines down. This is what happens. And I've been through periods where the utility in and around Washington, D.C. was -- you didn't do enough to keep the reliability up. So, it's always an issue. I think in California, we've been so used to mild climates and very high reliability that it's a little bit unusual. And what we've tried to do, and I'm going to let Caroline speak to this, is we've -- over the 10 years, we have tried to figure out a way, segment our grid, really take out the power, shut the power off for safety reasons in small areas where the wind speed is just too intense. And that doesn't cause as much issue. Although at the very beginning, it was difficult, but then we started to build centers for people to go to, got the communications chain. So, we learned a little bit by doing. I think up north, they're cutting off a much larger percentage of people, of course, they have a bigger territory. I don't think they're at the point yet where they can do exactly what we're doing; they can get there. But I think that's what you've seen a little bit of backlash on. It's something people in other parts of the country have had to deal with for most of their lives and people in Northern California haven't. Caroline, can you talk about this? Because what you've said is something about hundreds of thousands. We had a much smaller number of people out than that. They've had very significant, over 1 million, I think. Caroline, go ahead. Caroline Winn : Sure. In our last event, we impacted around 25,000 customers, as I mentioned earlier, and I would just tell you that over the past decade, we continue to improve. And one of the things that we did early on after we've had these public safety power shutoff, we set our senior management team to these communities that were impacted to do one thing, and that was to listen to customers. What were customers concerned, how can we lessen the impact when a PSPS occurs. And that's really where the idea of these community resource centers was generated from us going out and listening to our customers. And in turn, we're showing them the types of conditions that we're seeing and the types of wind speeds that the area is experiencing, and I would just tell you that we're also going out and doing community resilience fares. So, we're out in the communities that were most impacted. And I have to tell you that over the years, the impact and the response from customers has been actually positive. They're thanking us for turning off the power. And so I'm really pleased to hear that. Now is 100% of the customers happy? No, but I can tell you that customers are more accepting of the practice that we're doing and they know the conditions we're experiencing. And we're listening on how to lessen the impact to them when we do have to do a PSPS. Joe Householder : And you might talk too about how long have we had to turn people off and it's different in different areas? Caroline Winn : Yes, it's absolutely different in the highest elevation, where we've had to do more significant PSPS. But I can tell you, in the last -- the events over the last week, the average duration of these PSPS has been around 24 hours. So, we have tried to minimize that. However, we're also careful that we're not going to turn the system back on when the conditions prevail. We do 100% patrols of all of our circuitry and the circuit segments that we de-energize to ensure that there's no trees on the line. There's been no damage to the lines. And surprisingly, we have found things that have happened. We found broken poles. We found broken cross-arms. We found trees on wires. So, that's the importance of doing these 100% patrols before we turn back customers on. Paul Patterson : Okay. Well, great job, guys. I mean maybe, you guys can profit -- well, I don't know, maybe you guys can help the other guys up to the north, and maybe that could be appreciated some more? Joe Householder : We do. Paul Patterson : Okay. Thanks so much. Joe Householder : Thank you, Paul. Operator : And with that, it does conclude today's Q&A session. I would like to turn things back to Joe Householder for any additional or closing comments. Joe Householder : Thank you all for joining us today. I will see many of you at EEI in about a week. In any event, I'd like to express my gratitude to each of you for the confidence you've had in Sempra Energy and support you've given me, and it's been a real pleasure knowing you all. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team. And have a great day. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 27, 2020 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot, Faisel and thank you all for joining us today. In 2018, we laid out a strategic plan known as Vision 2022, which centered on our goal of becoming North America\u2019s premier energy infrastructure company. Over the past few years, we have made significant progress towards that goal and notably, we have sharpened our focus on the most attractive growth markets right here in North America, simplified our business model and strengthened our balance sheet. We have executed on this strategy by divesting non-core assets and reinvesting the proceeds into higher growth markets, namely California, Texas and Mexico in the liquefied natural gas export markets. These markets now enables us to focus on the delivery of cleaner and more secure forms of energy to consumers right here in North America as well as abroad. In addition, within the energy value chain, we are focused on transmission and distribution investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns and offer higher value for our stakeholders. This improved focus in capital discipline is paying dividends and our full year 2019 financial results are a direct reflection of these efforts. Earlier this morning, we reported full year 2019 adjusted earnings of $6.78 per share, the highest in our company\u2019s history. I will also point out that these strong 2019 financial results put us above our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range and highlight our company\u2019s continued execution of our mission to become North America\u2019s premier energy infrastructure company. In line with this positive momentum, we are affirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range and issuing our 2021 EPS guidance range. Additionally, our Board of Directors recently approved an 8% increase to our annualized dividend. On average, we have grown our dividend by over 10% annually for the last decade, which is one of the highest dividend growth rates in the utility industry. And to be clear, this represents our continued commitment to returning value to our shareholders. Please turn to the next slide, where I will provide an update on our strategic business review. As you will recall, we continue to review each of our businesses with a view towards continuing to optimize our capital allocation. This includes taking steps to integrate our overarching strategy, not just financially, but also operationally with the focus on people, priorities and culture all viewed to the lens of keeping our employees and communities safe. Based on our ongoing business review, we believe our sharpened geographic focus, favorable position in the energy value chain and high performance culture combine to offer unique visibility into our overall growth profile. Moreover, the continued execution of our strategy offers the opportunity to have a smaller geographic footprint, focused right here in North America with a bigger impact. Please turn to the next slide, where I will recap some of our notable accomplishments from 2019. In 2019, our company realized significant operational, financial, regulatory and legislative progress. I won\u2019t discuss everything that\u2019s referenced on the slide, but I did want to highlight a few key takeaways. Let\u2019s start with our California Utilities. In 2019, we circled three opportunities that we thought could improve our California businesses. First, securing critical wildfire legislation, second, completing the 2019 GRC, and third, advancing our 2020 cost of capital filings. I\u2019m happy to report that we reached constructive outcomes on each of these three items. At SDG&E, specifically, I wanted to highlight that we also announced the Fire Safe 3.0 program. This forward looking initiative is a continuation of SDG&E\u2019s industry leading Wildfire Mitigation program that has been built over the last decade. We are very excited about this initiative, which demonstrates our ability to innovate and improve how we deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers. In addition, we continue to work with the state and others to help to mitigate the risk of wildfires all across California. Turning to our Texas Utilities, Oncor completed its acquisition of InfraREIT and rolled out a new 5-year capital plan of approximately $11.9 billion. This plan reflects the continued growth that\u2019s occurring across Oncor service territory. Moving on to our LNG business, in 2019, we made progress on Cameron LNG putting Train 1 into service and starting production at Train 2. We also continue to advance commercial discussions with potential partners and off-takers for our LNG development projects, most notably, signing an HOA with Aramco Services Company for our proposed Port Arthur LNG project. We look forward to providing you with an updated view on the global LNG market as well as our four development projects at our upcoming Investor Day in March. Lastly, at Sempra Mexico, we announced contractual agreements with Mexico\u2019s CFE and established a constructive relationship with the new administration. Additionally we placed the Marine Pipeline into service, increasing Mexico\u2019s capacity to import affordable and reliable U.S. natural gas, which is displacing oil-fired electric generation and fueling their economy. This is yet again another example of how we\u2019re helping to enable the energy transition in every market we serve. We look forward to completing the other projects in our investment pipeline, to further increase energy accessibility and reliability for the people in Mexico. Next please turn to Slide 7 and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Trevor, who will review our business updates and financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. Let me start off by reviewing some key developments at our businesses so far this year. As Jeff mentioned earlier last year, we received a final decision on our California utilities GRC filings for the period 2019 through 2021. And in mid-January, the CPUC approved an extension of the GRC cycle. As a transitional step to migrate to utilities to a staggered full year GRC period, the decision directs SDG&E and SoCalGas to request two additional years. This results in a one-time 5-year GRC cycle covering the years 2019 through 2023. SDG&E and SoCalGas will soon file petitions for modifications to adjust their 2019 GRC decision for this extension. Subsequent to 2023, SDG&E and SoCalGas will revert to the new four-year GRC cycle. We believe the extension of the GRC cycle is a very constructive development. This decision increases the utilities\u2019 visibility into the future and should benefit all stakeholders as we implement a robust capital program around safety and reliability. Additionally, SDG&E recently received CPUC approval for its Line 1600 pipeline project. Work on this project has started and will be completed in phases, ending in 2024. This safety and reliability related project involves testing and replacing high consequence pipeline infrastructure that was originally constructed in 1949. The Line 1600 project is included in our base capital plan. Both the GRC outcome and this investment, further demonstrates the state\u2019s ongoing commitment to the safety and reliability of the gas and electric systems. SDG&E also filed its Wildfire Mitigation Plan in early February. This filing exemplifies the company\u2019s continued commitment to safety and reliability. Over the past decade, SDG&E has established itself as an industry leader in wildfire risk mitigation and plans to continue innovating and utilizing cutting-edge technologies to keep our customers and communities safe. Moving to Texas, we recently acquired Hunt\u2019s 1% indirect interest in TTI. This brings our total indirect interest in Oncor to 80.45%. We continue to be impressed by the rapid growth in Oncor\u2019s service territory and the overall macro and business environment. We look forward to Oncor providing additional updates on their business and the growth that you are seeing at our Investor Day in March. Shifting to Sempra LNG, Sempra Cameron LNG recently completed refinancing $3 billion of it\u2019s over $7 billion project level debt, resulting in improved near term cash flows and an overall increase in the project\u2019s net present value. Additionally, we recently achieved substantial completion for Train 2 and expect to start up commercial operation in the coming days. I\u2019ll highlight that Cameron LNG facility is approximately 99% complete and the progress to-date gives us confidence in the project timeline. In our proposed Port Arthur LNG project, we recently signed an Interim Project Participation Agreement with Aramco Services Company which is another great step forward for the project. We continue to engage in commercial discussions with other potential customers and partners and are targeting a final investment decision in the third quarter of 2020. For our proposed ECA LNG Phase 1 project we have selected TechnipFMC as our EPC contractor and expect to sign a lump-sum turnkey EPC contract in the coming days. Notably, we continue to expect a final investment decision later this quarter. Lastly, we continue to advance the sales of our South American businesses and expect to close the divestitures within the next 4 to 8 weeks. Please turn to the next slide and I will review our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $447 million or $1.55 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $864 million or $3.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2019 earnings were $447 million or $1.55 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $431 million or $1.56 per share. Full year 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.055 billion or $7.29 per share. This compares to 2018 GAAP earnings of $924 million or $3.42 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2019 earnings were $1.911 billion or $6.78 per share. This compares favorably to our full year 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.503 billion or $5.57 per share. Please turn to Slide 9. I\u2019ll reiterate that our full year 2019 adjusted earnings are the strongest in the history of our company. Year-over-year, our adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share grew by 27% and 22%, respectively. The variance in full year 2019 adjusted earnings when compared to last year, was affected by the following key items; $287 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities from higher CPUC base operating margin authorized in 2019, predominantly driven by the timing of the GRC final decision and it\u2019s corresponding impact on earnings recognition versus timing of spend; $157 million of higher equity earnings at the Sempra Texas Utility segment due to a full year of earnings from Oncor, Oncor\u2019s acquisition of InfraREIT and higher revenues due to rate updates to reflect increases in investor transmission capital offset by higher operating costs; $38 million and $31 million at SoCalGas and SDG&E respectively related to the January 2019 CPUC decision allocating certain accumulated deferred income tax balances to shareholders. This benefit was included in our 2019 adjusted guidance; and $36 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra LNG from Cameron LNG Train 1 commencing commercial operations in August of 2019. These items were offset by $92 million of lower earnings at Sempra Renewables related to the assets sold in December of \u201818 and April of \u201819; $19 million of lower equity earnings at Sempra LNG due to the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and associated fees to Cameron LNGs debt refinancing; and $10 million at SDG&E from the amortization of its wildfire fund assets. While we are not adjusting out the earnings impact of the annual wildfire amortization, we anticipate an impact to earnings of approximately $21 million per year on a go-forward basis. Please turn to the next slide. As most of you are aware, this March, we will be hosting our 2020 Investor Day at our headquarters here in San Diego. We are excited to provide you with an update on our business, which will include a review of our strategic vision, a discussion of our more focused portfolio, an update on each operating company and greater visibility into our long term financial plan. Please turn to the next slide, where I will provide a brief preview of our Investor Day that highlights our robust capital plan and visibility into our future earnings growth. Given the 2019 GRC at our California Utilities, the updated Oncor capital plan and recent feedback we have received from many of you, we wanted to preview some of the highlights of our upcoming Investor Day. First, our 5-year capital plan has increased from $25 billion to approximately $32 billion, the highest in our company\u2019s history. This capital plan is predominantly driven by our three U.S. utilities. Second, given the robust capital plan, we project an approximately 9% rate base CAGR, resulting in a projected combined rate base of over $50 billion by 2024. And lastly, we plan to fund this robust capital program with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our South American businesses, cash flows from operations and other sources. We will evaluate potential sources of financing based on the timing of our investments as well as a view toward maintaining a strong balance sheet. This really is an exciting time for our company and we look forward to sharing more details about our businesses and the overarching strategy at our Investor Day. Please turn to the last slide. In summary, 2019 was another excellent year for our company, both operationally and financially. The 8% increase to our dividend, affirmation of full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance, which includes the sale of South America and the issuance of our full year 2021 EPS guidance of $7.50 to $8.10 is a continuation of this positive momentum. As we shift our focus to the next several years, we remain committed to executing our financial plan, strengthening our balance sheet and maximizing value for all of our stakeholders. Our priority continues to be positioning our company for sustained growth, while connecting people to the cleaner and more affordable energy they need to power their lives. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning to you. Jeff Martin : Hey, Julien. How are you doing? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great, thank you. Congratulations. So maybe truly impressive, maybe to turn it back to you on the financing and listen, I bet every question you are going to get here is going to be somewhat of an ask around this Analyst Day. But when you think about the financing around this plan, the $32 billion plus some of the conversations out of the agencies, how do you think about that alongside also this FID with ECA etcetera? I mean there is so many different moving pieces here, again it\u2019s a leading indicator as to why you are having an Analyst Day to begin with, but at least initially, how are you thinking about dealing with the questions on the rating along with the \u2013 you have higher CapEx and along with funding a successful FID on LNG? Jeff Martin : Thank you for that question. I think the key takeaway Julien is that we have got a lot of options to fund our expected growth. I would start with the expected sale of proceeds from South America. Those two transactions continue to go well. We expect to close Chile next month. Peru could close next month, but it may slip into April. And by all indications, we are in good shape on both of those. We expect to use those proceeds which we talked about in our prepared remarks of roughly $4.55 billion to $4.85 billion and those are after-tax numbers to repay debt and also fund growth. We have targeted debt to cap by year end at 50% and that\u2019s consistent with the commitments we made for the rating agencies back-load to the Oncor deal. Also the thing we are pretty excited about is Phase 1 of Cameron continues to go quite well. We are actually expecting to have commercial operations on Train 2 in a couple of days. And when all three trains are online, we expect to have $400 million to $450 million of earnings from that project and more importantly, about $12 billion of after debt service cash over the project life. And I think to your larger point, as you have seen us do in the past, particularly in 2018 and \u201819, we will always evaluate all available sources of financing with a view towards financing our growth as efficiently as possible and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: That makes sense. And Jeff, while I have you, a quick follow-up here, when you think about your strategic options here, obviously you are very focused on execution at the core businesses, but you alluded to potential strategic opportunities a few calls ago. You guys executed on what is a pretty small piece here with the Oncor uptick, any latest thoughts about expansion in Texas in a bigger, more holistic sense, take it or leave it? Jeff Martin : I appreciate you asking that. We don\u2019t want to obviously communicate anything around mergers or acquisitions. But I can say that we have laid out a pretty important campaign, the inter-Texas obviously that started the Oncor transaction. It led to the InfraREIT transaction. We continue to develop relationships, which we think are important in Texas for execution. And you may have seen, we opened a Houston office. We made that announcement in the last month or two and that\u2019s where we are going to have a Center of Excellence both for Sempra Energy office as well as the office \u2013 some of our engineering and construction folks who will be supporting Cameron expansion and Port Arthur. And obviously, Julien, Port Arthur is a priority to us. So just as a market opportunity, Texas is a top priority to our company and we look forward to continuing to execute in the straight line there. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I will turn it over. Thank you very much. Look forward to seeing you, guys. Jeff Martin : Appreciate it, Julien. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. Jeff Martin : Hey, Greg. Greg Gordon : So looking \u2013 just going all the way back to the Analyst Day disclosures and looking at the expected rate base, the CapEx and rate base numbers, you have obviously had a significant increase in both, it looks to me \u2013 and I just wanted to confirm that this is correct that looking at 2022 rate base from Analyst Day, which was $41.5 billion, Analyst Day from SDG&E, SoCalGas and the Texas Utilities, it\u2019s now 10% higher, $45.7 billion in \u201822, am I reading that correctly that through a combination of the acquiring Sharyland, the increase in the Texas opportunity plus the rate case outcome that you are looking at a 10% higher rate base in \u201822 than you were looking at in March of last year? Jeff Martin : I think that\u2019s correct for \u201822 and I think it\u2019s also a change of about $7 billion across the 5-year period as a comparison. Greg Gordon : And look, I think Julian tried to ask this question, maybe it was a bit too broadly presented to you. So I will try again in a little bit more of a narrow perspective. Before we think about any other growth opportunities associated with the large capital expenditures you might need for ECA or Port Arthur or Cameron expansion, if all we were looking at was the funding of this growth opportunity in the utility businesses, did you just articulate that you thought you could do that organically or did I misread that and you are going to give us the equity needs on Analyst Day? Jeff Martin : I think you should expect, well, I guess, maybe a lot more detail at the Analyst Day, but I think if you think about how we have executed in the past, we have tried to be very, very efficient in terms of how we have accessed lowest cost forms of capital. Clearly, we are looking at our growth through the lens of maintaining a strong balance sheet. And I think obviously we don\u2019t want to forecast capital market activities, but we feel very good about the options in front of us. And look, we have a great problem here, right we have got a great big capital program. We have better visibility. In fact, we are having conversations in the last few days that we have taken a lot of risk off the table of SB 1054 having both rate cases get finished in California was a big deal. And now this is the first time ever, we don\u2019t have a 3-year rate case in California, Greg. We are looking at 5-year numbers that we are discussing on the phone and we have a 5-year rate case. We still got to make some petitions for modifications there. So I think we are in a position where we have unique visibility into the earnings power of the company and how much of it will be driven by rate base in this capital program that we are discussing, it\u2019s about 88% geared toward U.S. based utilities. So we feel very good about it. Greg Gordon : One more question before I hop off. My sense is that some of the reason why the stock is performing less well than it probably would if just all you were telling people was how great the utility story has evolved is because of trepidation over the growth opportunity in LNG given the contraction we are seeing in global economic activity because of coronavirus. What can you tell us about how that\u2019s affecting your negotiations, because at this point, I think people are just presuming that FID on Port Arthur at a minimum is off the table for the foreseeable future given market conditions? Jeff Martin : I appreciate you asking that question. I would start by going back, Greg and talking just briefly about our strategy. We are very focused on our long-term investments. As you have just been talking about, we do that through our California and Texas Utilities and outside of our utilities, obviously we are focused on long-term contracts with good counterparties. Today, there aren\u2019t any investments in our portfolio, zero, where we are allocating dollars to things which are exposed to commodity-driven businesses or based on short-term fundamentals. So as you turn to LNG, we have a deal in the marketplace, right. I mean there is a lot of people out there today that believe if the LNG marketplace will grow at 4%, 5%, we are talking with some counterparties that think it will grow at a 10% CAGR across the next decade. And our view is by the middle of the decade, there will be a shortage in available capacity to meet LNG demand. So even though growth rates vary, people have different views on it. But as you know, that\u2019s what creates the market and we think we are probably best positioned. When you think about the backdrop in North America, this is the market that has the lowest priced natural gas, it has the lowest priced volatility, it\u2019s got certainty of supply and execution and deep capital markets and we take that backdrop, Greg and we overlay it with 4 of our 5 projects are Brownfield, which creates a cost advantage and we have got access both to the West Coast and the Gulf Coast. Our confidence level in LNG remains the same. Right, it\u2019s a long-term focus. We expect to take FID on ECA in the next 30 to 45 days. Port Arthur remains on track, we believe to take FID in the third quarter. We have teams on the ground today in Saudi Arabia. We have folks in Western Europe. Our conversations remain focused on the long-term opportunities. And maybe as one final data point, turning to one of our execution program from Cameron to Port Arthur to ECA 1 calls for 24 million tons per annum. We have 21 signed up for 20-year contracts. So we are working on the last 12% currently and we remain optimistic. Greg Gordon : Thank you. Very detailed answer. Have a great day. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Greg. Appreciate it. Operator : Now we take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Fleishman : Yes, thank you. Just maybe one follow-up, I would assume that the \u2013 whatever your varied financing plans are would already be incorporated in the 2021 guidance range that you provided for the first time? Jeff Martin : What I would say as we have laid out our capital program for 5 years for you, which is kind of front-running the analyst conference, we would expect to fully provide details on each of the business unit guidance going forward and we are going to source financings as we think is necessary to meet that growth, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Okay, okay. But it would have \u2013 I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be, but I assume it would be in there already? Jeff Martin : Yes. Steve Fleishman : Because the rate base is in there, so then the financing, okay. Thanks. And then just with respect to, you mentioned very confident on closing the South America sales, my recollection is just like very little. There is no real way to \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get out of those agreements. So I just wanted to reconfirm your confidence there in closing shortly? Jeff Martin : Yes. Just to clarify on your first question, the answer was yes, just so we are clear. We have laid out guidance ranges that we are prepared to execute on relative to all of the financing options we will look at. On the South American question, those are progressing quite well. I have got Dennis Arriola here who is point person for our South American businesses and maybe Dennis, you can provide some details about our confidence level in closing those two deals. Dennis Arriola : Sure. Thanks Steve for the question. Now, things are going well. Obviously at the end of the year and in January that slowed down a little bit because of the holiday season. But we are progressing well with the antitrust bodies both in Chile and Peru and we are experiencing really good cooperation from each of the buyers. They are working through their transition plans from people, from financing, from systems and everything. So everything is on track, as Jeff said, to close over the next 4 to 8 weeks. So we are excited about it. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot, Steve. Operator : And now we take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hi, thanks everybody. Appreciate you all taking my question. I am looking at the capital plan slide. Actually I want to ask questions about the smaller wedges in there. Can you give a little detail about what specifically is in the $2.4 billion in the LNG bucket and the $2 billion in Mexico? Jeff Martin : Sure. I will just start by giving you a little bit of coverage and then Trevor can address that, but we will give you full detail, Michael, as we get closer now to analyst conference, including by the way business unit level earnings ranges, but, Trevor do you want to speak to the capital side? Trevor Mihalik : Yes, sure. Thank you, Michael. So predominantly in LNG, what you have got there is the cost for ECA, mid-scale. So that\u2019s the large uplift there. And in Mexico, that\u2019s predominantly associated with the build-out of their remaining projects around their fuel storage terminals and other projects like that. Michael Lapides : Got it. And is the ECA number, is that 100% or is that your pro rata share? Trevor Mihalik : That\u2019s our pro rata share. Michael Lapides : Okay, great. Trevor Mihalik : Right. 100% of the \u2013 on the LNG side, it\u2019s a 100% of the CapEx associated with ECA and then for Mexico because it\u2019s consolidated, it\u2019s also 100%. So you have to take the minority interest out of there. Michael Lapides : Got it. And also just thinking of sources of cash, you have the opportunity to go, I don\u2019t want to call it recapitalize, but refinance the debt structure at Cameron 1, 2, 3 and for many companies, tax deferrals or low cash tax payments tend to be a source of cash. Can you just talk a little bit about that, Trevor, just where you stand maybe in the kind of the debt restructuring or recapitalization at Cameron 1, 2, 3 and about how big of a cash taxpayer you expect to be? Trevor Mihalik : Yes, sure. No problem at all. So, as we mentioned on the prepared comments, we refinanced call it just under half of the existing debt at $3 billion and we took a little bit of a charge in \u201819 associated with that. That really stretched out the tenure of the debts to about 15 years and that\u2019s why we are saying it improved the economics, because it\u2019s improving the front-end cash flow on the project. With regards to the NOLs, roughly, we still are in NOL position through about 2024 and that it will kind of roll off over a 4, 5-year period. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated and we\u2019ll obviously see you all in late March. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. And now we take our next question from Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Hi. I wanted to ask one on Oncor, I mean, given the slowdown in commodity prices and potential slowdown in activity in the Permian in Texas. Can you speak to how insulated the CapEx outlook is within your plan and if there is any opportunity to review some of the spending? Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot, Ryan. Things are going very well for Oncor. We have got $11.9 billion in the capital plan. In fact, we are forecasting continued electricity growth, particularly in the west end of their system about an incremental 40% between now and 2022. So there is a lot of growth taking place both in the Dallas, Fort Worth area as well as West Texas. So we don\u2019t see any slowdown at all. In fact, we are continuing to be strained to meet all the capital needs for growth in that service territory. Ryan Levine : If the commodity price outlook were to continue to be under pressure, is there any capital that\u2019s tied to E&P activity that could be curtailed maybe in the longer duration spending? Jeff Martin : Well, we would always follow that particularly in West Texas. A lot of that growth, Ryan is also coming from the fact they have got about 95,000 megawatts of wind and solar and other generation in the interconnection through for ERCOT. A lot of that solar particularly is in West Texas. A lot of that is the transmission build-out that\u2019s unrelated to the E&P activity. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then in terms of the South America sale, is there any delay that\u2019s associated with the coronavirus in terms of the timing of closing the transaction or is it purely working through some of the remaining tax issues or other final closing proceedings? Jeff Martin : Yes. I think we feel confident to be very clear that both of those transactions are in good shape. We expect to close Chile as early as the middle of next month and then Peru will follow a few weeks thereafter. So I think we are in good shape on both of those transactions. Ryan Levine : Okay, thank you. Jeff Martin : Appreciate it. Operator : And now we take our next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Good morning. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : Just to follow-up on a few things here. With respect to coronavirus, I know you guys have long been avoiding commodity risk and what have you, but has there been any change given what\u2019s going on in terms of potential \u2013 your evaluation of counterparty risk or anything you see out there as a result of what we are seeing? Jeff Martin : I mean, obviously, I think you are asking about the virus generally impact some of the markets we are focused on in our LNG business and we haven\u2019t seen any sign. And obviously as you would expect, we are thoughtful about where people travel. We have instituted programs inside the company to make sure we are thoughtful about protecting our employees. But in terms of conversation with counterparties remember, we have a long-term view about supply and demand in the middle part of the decade and we are really dealing with people, Paul, that have a shared view of the potential infrastructure shortage. So the virus issue hasn\u2019t really impacted our negotiations with the customers we are talking to. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just on the rate base growth, I realize that you guys have different jurisdictions and different things driving the levels and what have you, but I am just wondering if you could give us a sense as to sort of the range of rate impact that you might be seeing, because some of it might be socialized differently and also you also are taking up big efforts to lower costs and what have you? How should we think about the rate impact? Jeff Martin : I think it\u2019s a really good question. Obviously, we are benefiting from a decade-long low in commodity prices, which is helpful on the bill. And I would start in Texas and you may recall that Oncor today has the lowest rates for those services in the state of Texas and they are forecasting, they will still have the lowest rates in the state of Texas when they complete their record capital program, which I referenced earlier at $11.9 billion. When you turn to California, I think the thing we feel good about from our rate case was there was real attention around the ramp process and making sure that capital has been allocated specifically around safety and reliability. So, as we think about the bill impact at SoCalGas, SoCalGas bills in the low $30 range. It\u2019s a very, very affordable service from the gas company. There is probably more pressure on the electricity side across the state. The good news is I always refer folks to this, as even though the rates have gone higher, the bill impacts are relatively subdued, because we have a pretty modest climate. So even at SDG&E today, including subsidies for low income housing and others, it\u2019s about $100 on the bill. And both of those are lower than the national average. So, we feel good about the capital program as a way of reducing risk in the operating environment and we feel good that we are benefiting from low commodity prices and obviously a large pool of customers if that gets spread across. Paul Patterson : Okay, thanks a lot. Jeff Martin : Appreciate it, Paul. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. And now, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Jeff Martin for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot. I would just like to express our gratitude for folks who joined the call today. We certainly look forward to seeing all of you in San Diego at our Investor Day that would be on March 24. If you have any follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to contact the IR team. We wish each of you a good day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Faisel Khan. Please go ahead. Faisel Khan : Good morning. And welcome to Sempra Energy\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section. Several members of our management team are on the line with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra LNG,; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Kevin Sagara, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric, and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As we continue to monitor the potential impact from the ongoing pandemic is important to keep in mind that actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. All the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. I would also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 4, 2020 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot Faisel. And thank you all for joining us today. We hope everyone staying safe and well during this public health crisis. And our hearts certainly go out to all those who've been impacted by this pandemic. In the midst of all this, we're reminded that our employees face health risks in their daily lives and unique challenges in performing their jobs. That's why our first principle here at Sempra has been and continues to be keeping them safe. On this slide we provide a few examples of some of the health and safety initiatives that we've implemented all while providing critical services to our customers and supporting our communities. Specifically, we've issued additional, personal protective equipment for our field employees and implemented revised protocols for customer engagement. We've hired an infectious disease expert to assist us in implementing safety procedures for all employees. We've instituted travel bans and limited building access. Employees that can work from home continue to do so. We've rolled out enhanced resources for employees such as technology reimbursements, revised sick and emergency leave policies and expanded mental health services. And we've invested in our communities by committing over $8 million across the Sempra family of companies to help those providing critical services to those in need. I cannot be more proud of the commitment and dedication of all of our employees during this period. It is one of those times of great challenge where notwithstanding the fact that many of us are working remotely, that it's our values and mission that continues to unite us. We're actively monitoring the situation and will revise our protocols as necessary to continue providing safe and reliable service to over 35 million consumers each day. Please turn to the next slide. Before discussing the quarter, I'd like to take a moment and thank everyone who joined us for our virtual Investor Day just over a month ago. We certainly appreciated having the opportunity to provide you with important business updates and highlight our overarching strategy. You'll recall that at the core of that strategy is our mission, where we've made a commitment to build North America's premier energy infrastructure company. And one of the important takeaways from this call we believe is that we're continuing to make great progress on that mission. Most recently, we've completed the sale of our Peruvian businesses and expect to close the sale of our Chilean businesses later this month. We also achieved mechanical completion and began the startup of the third and final train at Cameron LNG Phase 1 and at ECA Phase 1. We just recently finalized two sale and purchase agreements totaling 2.5 million tons per annum. These 20-year agreements with high credit worthy counterparties highlight the strategic advantage of being able to offer liquefaction capacity to our customers from facilities on both the West Coast and Gulf Coast. Again, the execution of these two new agreements speaks to the market need particularly right here in North America for critical new export infrastructure. We'll be discussing these developments in more detail later in today's presentation. In combination, our strategy, capital rotation program, improved capital discipline and effective execution have improved the earnings power of our company. And this can be seen in our strong first quarter results. Giving these positive developments, I'm pleased to say that we're reaffirming and more importantly guiding to the upper end of our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance range. We are also reaffirming our 2021 EPS guidance range. Please turn now to Slide 6. Two years ago we laid out a strategic plan to reposition our business and improve our financial performance with three key objectives in mind. First, to focus our portfolio on the most attractive markets in North America.  Second, to utilize our skills and strong operating history to create a Tier 1 leadership position in those markets. And finally, to position our business in that portion of the energy value chain, where we believe we can produce the most attractive risk-adjusted returns. Looking at our portfolio today, we've made great progress. Focusing our geographic footprint on leading energy markets in North America, while further improving the quality and strength of our earnings. This approach has helped create a higher growth and more resilient infrastructure platform is well positioned to compete through different market cycles and deliver long-term value to our stakeholders. Please now turn to Slide 7 where I'll provide an overview of our South American business sale. As many of you saw we recently completed the sale of our equity interest in our Peruvian businesses to an affiliate of China Yangtze Power International for total cash consideration of approximately $3.6 billion. Additionally, we continue to advance the announced sale of our equity interest in our Chilean businesses to China State Grid International Development for an anticipated sales price of approximately $2.2 billion. I like to emphasize that all parties remain quite motivated to complete the Chilean transaction and we're targeted to close later this month. Also think it's important to mention that closing the Peru transaction is yet another example of our ability to execute our strategy even in a challenging business environment. Please turn to the next slide. Our management team continues to strive to be prudent stewards of your capital. Our recent efforts over the last couple years have resulted in approximately $8.3 billion of announced proceeds from completed and pending asset sales. This capital recycling has provided us with the level of capital efficiency as we expanded our utility footprint in Texas with Oncor and as follow-on grew that platform with the subsequent acquisition of InfraREIT. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Trevor to review our current liquidity position and credit profile, as well as to discuss operational and financial result. Please turn to the next slide. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks Jeff. Many of you saw a similar slide at our recent Investor Day, but here we've revised it to reflect our updated liquidity position. I want to call out the largest change which is the incorporation of the proceeds received from the sale of Peruvian businesses. As of Friday, Sempra Parent's liquidity is over $6 billion, up significantly from the $3.3 billion at the Investor Day. Combined Sempra Parent's SDG&E and SoCalGas at $6.7 billion of revolving credit capacity. Those facilities are currently undrawn other than support for the approximate $600 million of commercial paper that's outstanding at Parent. As this slide illustrates, the combined Sempra family of companies have a very strong liquidity position. We currently have nearly $10 billion of liquidity including cash on hand and undrawn committed credit facility. This is before the sale of our Chilean asset, which we expect to conclude later this month. It also excludes Oncor, which has a strong liquidity position with roughly $2.5 billion. When we talk about the resilience of our business, liquidity is an important part of that because it helps us ensure that we can safely operate our businesses, fund our capital plan and support the growing dividend. Please turn to Slide 10. Now I would like to discuss the steps we're taking to improve our credit profile. Our Board of Directors and management team have taken a series of discipline steps to allocate capital more efficiently, while improving our credit metric. Specifically, we've diversified our US utility rate base into the pure play T&D assets in the Texas market, divested US renewables generation and non utility natural gas storage asset; issued $6.5 billion of common equity and mandatory convertible preferred stock as part of the $9.45 billion acquisition of Oncor and moved two of the three trains of Cameron LNG Phase 1 into operation. With the third only months away and optimized project economics and cash flows through refinancing nearly half of its project debt. When in full operation, this will provide a valuable and recurring stream of cash flows. In combination, the result has been a continuous decrease in the ratio of our holding company debt to total debt, while improving the quality of our earnings mix and business risk profile.  With this in mind, we also continue to target approximately 16% FFO to debt and 50% debt to total capitalization by year-end. We do not plan to issue any common equity to fund our current capital plan. Please turn to Slide 11. This quarter we had several positive developments at our US utility infrastructure businesses. First, at SDG&E, we had our FERC cost of capital all party settlement approved, notably our FERC authorized ROE will now be 10.6% including the continuation of the 50 basis point CAISO adder. This is an increase of 55 basis points over our previously authorized ROE of 10.05%. As a reminder, SDG&E needs FERC rate base is approximately 40% of its total rate base. We're pleased with this decision and believe it benefits all stakeholders. Second at both SDG&E and SoCalGas, we recently filed a joint petition for modification related to 2019 the general rate case. Further CPUC's direction we requested attrition rates for our fourth and fifth years. At SDG&E, we requested 4.77% and 4.64% for 2022 and 2023 respectively. At SoCalGas, we requested 4.95% and 4.16% for 2022 and 2023 respectively. In support of a five-year rate case outcome, we believe these attrition rates are reasonable and should enable us to continue investing in critical infrastructure designed to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers and the communities we serve. We requested a final decision on this matter by year-end.  Shifting to Texas, Oncor continues to execute on its capital plan, about 90% of the projects in Oncor's transmission budget through 2021 do not need further approvals before commencing construction. On the distribution side Oncor connected approximately 18,000 new customers in the first quarter. Furthermore, overall demand in ERCOT actually increased in the first quarter of 2020 over the first quarter of last year. The increase was roughly 1%, but it's still notable given the market backdrop. In addition, Governor Abbott has announced a phased reopening of businesses to help restart the Texas economy. Please turn to Slide 12 where I'll discuss developments at Sempra LNG and Sempra Mexico. Starting at Cameron LNG Phase 1. We've achieved mechanical completion introduced feed gas and initiated the startup process for Train 3. Importantly, this keeps us on track to produce LNG in the second quarter and to place Train 3 into service early in the third quarter. At this point, construction is essentially complete and we look forward to bringing the entire facility into operation soon. As a reminder, we expect this project to generate full run rate earnings of $400 million to $450 million annually and nearly $12 billion of after-debt service cash flows back to us during the 20-year contract period. Shifting to the LNG market and our development project. We've had a long-held belief that new LNG infrastructure will be needed by the middle part of this decade to support increasing demand. But fewer projects expected to take FID as a result of reduced capital spending in the oil and gas sector and some LNG developers being financially constrained. We believe there will be an even greater need for our projects. Our financial strength and advantaged locations on the West Coast and Gulf Coast helped provide us with a competitive advantage to continue to grow our LNG infrastructure platform. Along these lines, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we recently signed 20-years sale and purchase agreements with Total and Mitsui for a total of 2.5 million tons per annum at ECA LNG Phase 1. We continue to work closely with the Mexican government to secure the final SENER permit and to reach FID. We continue to target FID this quarter and we're optimistic the permit can be issued in a timely manner to support that. Shifting to Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. This past quarter, we announced a fixed-price turnkey EPC agreement with Bechtel. However, given the current market environment, we've updated the FID timing for the project to 2021. We continue to work with our current and potential customers on the optimal timing of the project and will continue to be disciplined on how we allocate capital to the project. Turning to Sempra Mexico. We're continuing to develop projects that provide cleaner, more reliable energy as well as energy accessibility for the people of Mexico. We're continuing to monitor the situation, but as a result of the current pandemic, it's reasonable to expect that some of the construction capital will be deferred from 2020 to 2021. Nevertheless, we believe demand for our existing network of pipelines and power assets remain strong and are critical to the people of Mexico. Please turn to Slide 13. Looking at our financial results, this was a really excellent quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported strong first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $760 million or $2.53 per share. This compares to first quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $441 million or $1.59 per share. In our ongoing effort to build resiliency and continuing to resolve legacy matters, we reported two charges in the first quarter. First, we recorded a charge of $100 million related to our previous ownership of the RBS Sempra Commodities trading business. This charge represents an estimate to settle certain tax related legal matters associated with activities of more than a decade ago. Second, we recorded a $72 million after-tax charge related to the 2015 Aliso Canyon incident. We have recently engaged in settlement discussions with private plaintiffs related to the civil litigation. As you may recall, we settled with the government plaintiffs in 2019 for $120 million. For more information regarding Aliso Canyon, please refer to our 10-Q. Shifting back to the consolidated earnings. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2020 earnings were $932 million or $3.08 per share. This compares favorably to our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of $534 million or $1.92 per share. Please turn to Slide 14. The variance in first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following key item. $66 million of income tax benefit in 2019 at the California Utilities resulting from the January 2019 regulatory decision that provided direction on how to allocate certain excess deferred income tax balances. This was offset by a $174 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities from higher CPUC based operating margin, net of operating expenses including $120 million of lower CPUC base operating margin in 2019 due to the delay in the issuance of the 2019 GRC final decision. $136 million variance at Sempra Mexico due to the impacts from foreign currency and inflation effects net of foreign currency hedges. $85 million of higher earnings at Sempra LNG from higher equity earnings from Cameron primarily due to Train 1 and Train 2 commencing commercial operations under their tolling agreements in August 2019 and February 2020 respectively. As well as higher earnings from Sempra LNG marketing operations primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices. $38 million of higher earnings from higher electric transmission margin and SDG&E including impacts from the March 2020 FERC approved TO5settlement preceding and $11 eleven million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities driven primarily by the impact of Oncor's acquisition of InfraREIT in May of 2019 and higher revenues due to rates being updated to reflect increases in invested transmission capital. This was partially offset by higher operating cost and lower consumption due to weather. Please turn to the final slide. Our management team is very pleased with the progress we've made so far this year. The accomplishments discussed are a direct result of the successful execution of our strategic mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. And we feel well positioned for success going forward. The key for us is to stay focused on executing our capital plan, which is primarily focused on our California and Texas utility. We also are committed to ensuring the delivery of safe and reliable energy to our customers and communities we serve, enabling energy security and diversification locally and globally and expanding energy accessibility. In combination, our strategy, well-executed capital rotation and disciplined execution of our CapEx program are all designed to improve our business resiliency and overall financial performance. Finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees particularly those on the frontlines who have continued to work diligently in pursuing our mission and safely serving our customers and community. We're fortunate to have such a talented and dedicated workforce. One that has maintained a culture of high performance during this challenging period, which has impacted us all in various ways.  With that we will conclude our prepared remarks and start to take your question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. StephenByrd: Families are doing okay in this challenging time. I wanted to first just touch on ECA and the process from here in terms of the export permit. Could you just talk in a little more detail in terms of just what the steps are to get through that process? The review by SENER and sort of just where we stand just so we can try to follow that a little - a little more closely. JeffMartin: Thanks Stephen for that question. I'll provide a little bit of context where we're at from the LNG standpoint and then I'll pass it to Dennis who's been following that closely both on the US government side as well as the Mexican side. I think one of the things that we just like to call out for purposes of this call is we've long talked about the competitive advantages of our companies, Stephen, around scale and financial strength in the LNG space. Our long history in the natural gas space dating back to the middle part of the 1800s. The geographically advantaged nature of our project and the fact that four out of five of them are brownfield project, which we believe gives us a cost advantage. So assigning three contracts in the last three weeks. I think, it speaks to the importance of these advantages and we talked about a little bit in our prepared remarks. We've been very, very clear and consistent about our view of there being a deficit and needed export infrastructure all around the world in the middle part of the decade. And I think, as you think about the market dislocation is occurring in the oil and gas market. This is the time where we think that the need in the middle part of the decade will only become more acute because the low prices of today are allowing for greater market penetration for LNG both in new markets in Europe and particularly East Asia by the way. And I think that this same market is challenging. Many of the other less well capitalized developers. So to get two new contracts essentially to sell out the capacity of ECA is a big positive. And I would also mention this is the first time ever in the history of our company, we've had all of our customers at Cameron sign up for Phase 2. So that's a nice step forward as we look to continue to development there, but the next big step in terms of FID is the heart of your question, which is the SENER permit and I'll pass that to Dennis for additional commentary. DennisArriola: Thanks Jeff and hi, Steven. Yes, look, there's no doubt that what's going on in Mexico with the pandemic has the government focused on that. And it is impacting the timing of the SENER approval. But I think that one of the other things - we've taken into consideration that this is the first time this SENER has had to approve an LNG export facility in Mexico. So it's a different animal for them. But having said that the discussions our teams have had with various members of the administration in Mexico, including the President himself that gives us great confidence that SENER permit is going to get approved. It's just a matter of timing and when you look at what's going on in Mexico and specifically in Baja California, this project is extremely important to that region given the number of jobs it's going to bring; the economic stimulus and just the impact it's going to have on the municipality. So we've been having conversation with the governor of the state and he's extremely supportive of this project and has spoken out on that. The other thing I've mentioned is when you look at this project; it's not only good for the US and our natural gas producers. But it brings badly-needed foreign direct investments Mexico. It brings natural gas to customers and businesses in the region and it also provides offtake customers in Asia with a highly competitive and strategic access point on the West Coast. So this is a winner. It's just a matter of time. StephenByrd: Understood. So if I'm sort of hearing that correctly certainly Covid can cause delays but it's not as if there's some sort of change out of politically or policy-wise just that would drive a different outcome or more challenge than we've seen before. DennisArriola: No. We don't believe so. Again, I think everyone understands the economic impact and what this does not just to export gas through Mexico, but it actually brings natural gas to that region, which badly needs it. JeffMartin: I'd also add to Dennis's point, Steve, too is the level of support we've had from the Secretary of Energy, Secretary of State, the entire administration here in the United States has also been quite helpful. So I mean our forecast remains that we'll get the SENER permit in the second quarter. We've got the right team in place to do it. I think we have to be sensitive to the fact that everyone not just the United States, but in Mexico is taking the Covid challenge very seriously. And that's certainly impacting the delay as the agencies are currently shut down. StephenByrd: That's really helpful color. And if I could just follow up separately on Oncor, we've always liked the growth outlook in Texas. I wondered if you could just refresh us in terms of just potential areas for additional spending, other policy objectives in the state or just any other areas of upside as you look at your Texas business. JeffMartin: Sure. I'll tackle that at a high level. We've got the benefit of having Allen online and I'll pass it to Allen. And I'll go back to kind of fundamentals of Sempra is. I think if you've followed Stephen for a long time we've really been trying to strategically reposition the company more around utility investments in the United States and secondly specifically T&D investments. So California really is an infrastructure opportunity because we're decoupled here. This is all about deploying capital for safety and reliability in the state of California. Very, very similar in Texas not all is Oncor not commodity exposed, they don't own generation. So we're very attracted to that T&D business model, the Allen lay down at our Investor Day $11.9 billion record five-year capital program for his business and you may recall he had a separate slide on additional capital opportunities. So even though they're seeing some impacts from the pandemic in Texas like a lot of other places. Number one Governor Abbott is reopening the state. And number two really interesting feedback on the demand even in ERCOT, a year-over-year demand in Q1 was up not down which is interesting and one of the things I've been intrigued by is even as you think about impacts in the Delaware basin or the Permian, you still have a very high percentage of drillers. They're using standby generation and there's a huge price discount, it allows them to lower the marginal cost of production, if they can connect to the grid. So the activity in Allen's team remains quite high. But I'll stop and, Allen, if you can provide some more commentary about the diversity of your load and the diversity of your growth. I think that might be helpful to Stephen. AllenNye: You bet. Yes. And thanks Stephen for the question. And I think Jeff covered most of it, but just to reiterate our $11.9 billion over five years, we still feel good about the 3.5 based on what we know right now for this year. We actually have a little upward pressure. You may have seen we've spent a little more in Q1 than we had anticipated. But we still have - we have for example increased in generation interconnection request. I think the last time we talked we had about 10 at the analyst conference. We're up to 13 now for this year's plan. We are continuing to see some pressure in West Texas with our transmission projects out there, both on the construction clearances and on the right way side.  So we're seeing some increased CapEx there and while West Texas certainly we're going to see some offset with the customers delaying projects and things like that. Just as a data point as of last week, we did receive 22 initiative additional requests for new oil and gas load in West Texas. So we have our transmission projects that we're working, three-year project in West Texas to Jeff's point four, five with ERCOT last week identifies approximately 40% of the load in that region, oil and gas load is self-generating right now that we continue to build to those operators. I mentioned the renewable generation uptick and we're continuing invest in reliability projects and congestion relief in the area. So we feel good is based on what we know right now about our 3.5 this year as Jeff also mentioned in the Analyst conference we had a better part of a $1 billion identified as additional incremental. We'll just see how that goes, what the needs are; some of that is deferred maintenance based on the significant growth we've had over the last few years. But that's where we are right now. We feel good based on what we know about the 2.5. There are still opportunities on our system to invest. We connected 18,000 new premises in Q1. Some of those certainly will be deferred and delayed depending on how long this goes. But overall right now we feel good about our 2.5 and plus we have the incremental capital available, if necessary. Operator : Our next question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. ShahriarPourreza: Hey, guys. How are you doing? Good morning. How are you doing? Just a couple questions here on the credit metrics there's obviously a review that's outstanding, but you obviously have a very good capital recycling story with the South America asset and delevering. How patient sort of are the rating agencies on seeing the sell-through and the plan that you highlighted today? Including a noticeable reduction in the holdco debt. It's a 90-day review period. So how are their conversations going and how do we sort of think about taking the downgrade? The potential downgrade versus incremental equity that could satisfy their balance sheet concerns. You're obviously full speed ahead in LNG and regulated CapEx opportunities. JeffMartin: Shar, I appreciate the question. And I think I'll start back in 2017 in the summer. We were looking at making the investment in EFH. We spent a lot of time with the agencies in around how we would finance the transaction. You may recall we even increased the amount of equity we used in that transaction to accommodate kind of our goals. At that time, we set out a goal that would support an investment grade plus rating to acquire that business. And one of the things you recall we did was we actually laid out a broader strategic reposition of the business about how we were moving from being South America invested to be and North American focused and not just in North America but around a different quality of asset around T&D, which I think lowered our business risk profile. At that point in time, we laid out some goals with the agencies through 2030. I mean through 2020 I'm sorry. And I think part of the discussion we had in Investor Day and on this call is really is the progress we're making toward those goals. So I think our business today with Cameron coming online with us more invested in North America and with us more invested with regulatory diversity into Texas and particularly pure-play T&D. We've made a lot of progress. I think, Trevor, perhaps you can update us on the metrics that we're tracking to and how you think we're doing for the rest of the year with the agency. TrevorMihalik: Sure, Jeff. Thanks for the question, Shar. As Jeff said, we are continuing to target our FFO, the debt metric 16% by the end of the year and what we are also doing with the recycling of the capital targeting, our debt to cap ratio of around 50%. And we brought our Parent debt down to about 26% by the end of this year. So look, we continue to work with the agencies around our plan, help them understand how we've significantly de-risked this business. And as I said at the Analyst Conference and reiterated today. We don't have to issue equity to reach these metrics. I will say that our high BBB plus rating is important to us. But we also need to balance that with what's also important to our shareholders. And then the last thing I would also point out that we have pushed Port Arthur into 2021 and this is one of the areas that the rating agencies have raised that, if you get into LNG in a big way they would look at this and so we believe this is a very strong credit profile. ShahriarPourreza: Got it. Thank you for that. And then just on slide 8 where you talk about sort of capital location. There's some language obviously there where you reference further expanding your utility footprint in Texas and I know Allen touched a little bit on the capital opportunities. Can you just maybe a little bit elaborate further on this? Is this organic? Is it inorganic? Are you kind of referring to the remaining ownership stake you don't own with Oncor, with TTI? Or do you see other opportunities there? Just trying to get a sense. JeffMartin: Shar. I appreciate giving us the opportunity to clarify that. If you go back and look at the prepared remarks, what we're really talking about was the level of capital efficiency that we could generate from a relatively ambitious capital rotation program that we announced in the first half of 2018. Because as you see on that slide, it talks about announcement pending proceeds of about $8.3 billion and we bought Oncor for $9.45 billion, I mean, the EFH portion of Oncor as well as spending about another $1 billion on InfraREIT to us effectively taken place is we've taken non-core assets or assets in South America and in the process of selling those we've effectively rotated them into Oncor and InfraREIT. And this really goes to the heart of your credit question because you're getting higher quality earnings and you're getting a lower risk profile. And I think that's reflected in the original commitments we made to the agencies back in 2017. And then I would just go on to say that we're opening up a center of excellence in the second half of this year in Houston at the Galleria that's really to support the growth in Justin's business and LNG is we look could continue to support both Cameron Phase 2 and Port Arthur from that Houston office. So look, it is a market of strategic significance to us. I think the purpose of that slide, Shar; it's really highlighted capital efficiency of rotating from those businesses into a new market for us. ShahriarPourreza: Got it. So nothing in organic for you within the state. JeffMartin: That's right. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research LLC. SteveFleishman: Hey. Good morning. Mainly just follow up here. So just on the - from the Texas business Oncor, do you have any data yet for the month of April since that was really when we had the - [Multiple Speakers] JeffMartin: That's interesting. We talked a little bit about, yes, we talked a little bit about that the overall growth profiling in ERCOT was up year-over-year and then Allen has some data for April 1. I think as you expect it's going to be different by asset class. But I think at least now and you can speak to this. I think your overall distribution revenues are up in April compared to last year. But I'll let you speak to what you're seeing on the system. JeffMartin: Allen, are you there? AllenNye: Sorry. Yes. I'm here. I hit the wrong button. Thanks for question, Steve. Here's what we've got for April. Overall distribution based revenues are up 1% versus April '19 that includes residential revenue increased by about 10% versus April last year C&I is down 5.5% versus last April. Weather normalized about 1.7% lower with distribution rate that based revenues about $4 million coming off a quarter of $150 million in revenue. So that's what we've got. That's what seen so far in April. We're continuing to expect weather to be the largest driver for the remainder of the year as we talked about before. Weather typically goes plus or minus 25 in revenues and plus or minus $20 million in net income. 16 of the last 21 years have been positive in that regard So we'll see what's going to happen there. And then as someone mentioned earlier on the call, I think it was Trevor, with the governor phasing the opening of Texas. We expect to see some positives there as well. But we'll just have to see how it goes as it opens. But those are the numbers we have for April so far. Thanks. SteveFleishman: Okay and just one follow up on that. So if you're obviously seeing a continued shut in very meaningful nominal of Texas oil rigs in particular that when we think of giving the self generation that a lot of them do and your mix that is not going to be kind of a big overall driver to your margin or how should we think about that? AllenNye: Yes, Steve. Let me try - JeffMartin: Sorry, go ahead, Allen. AllenNye: To try to address it this way, approximately 12% of our overall revenues come from West Texas; of that amount approximately 38% to 40% are on the industrial side. So the rest are residential or commercial. So that's probably some guidance on what the exposure is there. Jeff, I'm sorry I interrupted you. JeffMartin: Oh, that's okay. I think that's very helpful. Another thing I was going to say to, Steve is that Allen's team continues to update us on, I think, something in the neighborhood of 30% or 40%. Allen, correct me if I'm wrong still you stand by generation that you have to 25%, 30% level. So there's still a clamoring for people who are producing to move to the grid but most of Allen's capital program is laid out for this year and next year's pretty much locked in the not really on incremental new growth, but catching up to a growth that's already been registered on the system. But is that a fair way to characterize it, Allen? JeffMartin: That's correct, Jeff, both on the CapEx over the next couple of years as well as the report that we started has 40% of oil and gas load basically in the region on self-gen. Thank you. SteveFleishman: Great. One other general question, so just the - like to see you point to the high end of the 2020 range getting everything that's going on. So just some of the things that happen this quarter like FX can move around. So just when you think about - when we think about what's driving you to the high end of that range. Could you just kind of give a simple view of what the drivers are for that? JeffMartin: Sure, Steve. I'd be glad to. I'll provide a little bit contexts about how I'm thinking about it and Trevor can speak to some of the drivers in the quarter. Well, I think we feel fairly confident going forward. One of the things we've done as a team, Steve, is I think back to what we tried to accomplish in 2019. You may recall having followed us that we had original guidance of $5.70 to $6.30. And in the second half a year, we raised last year's guidance just $6.00 to $6.50 and still exceeded that. You may recall just in our Q4 call we reported full-year adjusted earnings of $6.78. So we had a banner year yet last year with record earnings of $1.91 billion on adjusted basis. So to put that in perspective in the first quarter of this year we have produced and recorded roughly one half of the earnings from full year 2019, right. So even though it's early in the year, we have a pretty robust view of what we think we should accomplish. And a lot of it, Steve, is driven by the fact that across our utilities we remain on track with our capital programs which are fairly aggressive. and I'll conclude before passing to Trevor that one of the things we've agreed to do on our team is as we go into the summer, we're going to do a full bottoms up on our 2020 and our 2021 guidance range and make sure that we're in a position to make the appropriate adjustments as we go into our Q2 call. So we're quite bullish on our forecasts for 2022 and we're going to try to update that and take a second look at 2021 as we are closer to our August call But, Trevor, perhaps you can talk about some of things that you're seeing from the quarter that causes our confidence level to be high for the remainder of the year. TrevorMihalik: Sure. Thanks Jeff. Good afternoon, Steve. Jeff really did cover a lot of this, but again I would direct you maybe to slide 14 of the deck where we did the waterfall up from last year. And again, if you take a look at some of the big drivers, you certainly are seeing the numbers at the California Utilities with the CPUC based operating margin up $174 million, very constructive rate case that we are now seeing the impact as we're implementing the rate case and providing safe and reliable service to our customers. Also, we had a good result from the FERC around the T05. And so, that also is in the transmission margin at SDG&E of $38 million as we implemented that. And then, again Cameron, we saw Train 2 come on a little early and we're hopeful that maybe Train 3 could come on a couple of weeks early and that will also give us a great deal of surety around where we're going to end up for the year. And then, Oncor continues, as Allen said, to implement their capital plan. So, we feel very, very good about the three utilities executing on this robust capital plan during the year. And then, of course, we do have mechanisms that are being put in place at the three utilities to protect from any potential downside associated with the pandemic. So again, I think that's why we felt pretty good about guiding to the upper end of the range. SteveFleishman: Okay. I apologize; I just wanted to ask one clarification with Jeff. Just the review of 2020-2021, as you go into the middle of the year. Are you kind of saying with a bias to the upside, given what you did last year, and same thing happened as opposed to kind of dealing with pandemic-type risks? That I just wanted to clarify that. JeffMartin: One of the things to remember Steve was in our June Analyst Day, which was in New York in 2018, we went ahead and talked about our '18 guidance and our '19 guidance, and actually put out and published our 2020 guidance, right. The $6.70 to $7.50. So, we put out that $0.80 range back in June of 2018 and that's even as we were just starting the sales process for our solar and wind. We made a decision at that point to sell South America. So, we had executed across a relatively sweeping capital rotation program, at the same time that we've been rotating capital back in the California and Texas. So, I think what you're seeing is, we had strong momentum last year while we were executing our capital rotation program. And then, you're seeing that carry through into this year and we go through a pretty bottom up process to keep an evergreen plan. But look, I think what you're hearing is, we had a remarkable first quarter in 2020. We're guiding to the high end of the range. We typically don't change our guidance this early in the year. We're certainly going to be positively inclined as we review both 2020 and 2021 as we go into the summer. Operator : And our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. JonathanArnold: Hi, good afternoon. Oh, good morning to those of you guys. Hi, first on the Mexico and FX gain in the quarter, obviously on the 20% devaluation, your rule of thumb would have pointed to a bigger number. But, you tell us back then there are colors and other reasons, it wouldn't be linear. I'm just curious, is there anything embedded in Q1, where you, any hedging costs to be tried to lock some of this in perhaps or are we still open going into the rest of the year? JeffMartin: Thanks a lot, Jonathan. I'll start with some context and pass it to Trevor; he'll review the rule of thumb and will go through the financial statement impacts. But I always want to go back to first principles, which, we've been in this business for about 20 years in Mexico, and one of the things I think has really been a critical advantage for us, has been that our contract portfolio is U.S. dollar denominated, which is a big plus in that market, and we've got contract tenor in that portfolio of over 20 years. So, we have a great long-term contracted portfolio, which is U.S. dollar based. And that comes with the obligation that at year-end, you remit your tax liability in pesos. So, Trevor's team has traditionally done a very good job of having a hedging strategy allows us to lock-in and supports our plan. And I'll pass it to Trevor to review the rule of thumb and the impact in the Q1 financial statement. And I think this is one of the things that is always important for us to talk about, when we talk about Mexico. TrevorMihalik: Perfect, thanks, Jeff. Yes, so, Jonathan, again, I would direct you to our rule of thumb that basically says, for every 5% move in the peso, it's roughly about a $45 million of earnings impact. And again, I want to emphasize that this earnings impact is really a non-cash impact. And so, you ultimately kind of have to pay the taxes. And as Jeff said, we're U.S. dollar denominated in Mexico, but we pay taxes in the peso. So, when you actually look at Table F, and Table F is that the detailed financials that we show by each of the businesses that we put out in the morning with regards to our press release. You'll see that there are three big line items that are being impacted by FX. It's really other income that was $283 million negative in the current period, and then you have the income tax line item, that's $307 million to our benefits and that's really kind of where all of the depreciating peso manifests itself on the P&L. And then, there are also line item equity earnings. And there is - the equity earnings really is the inter-company loan that we have with the marine pipeline and that's offset really - the FX impact there is the offset in the other income and expense line item. So, quite a few moving pieces, but as Jeff said, we do look to put a hedge strategy in place really to protect ourselves from very large moves on the upside or the downside and we're really kind of at that, bumping up against that right now with regards to any further P&L benefit. JonathanArnold: So, can I - I mean just as we say like, my question is, have you locked in any of the benefit at this point of the year? JeffMartin: So, Jonathan, we take roughly the same approach every year, it's largely based on a costless collar. And we don't typically lock in and we have a range that we guide to and the whole goal really is to minimize impact to the plan and I think we're comfortable with what our plan is today and what we've recognized. I think, Trevor is basically saying that it's skewed basically to protect you more on the downside than upside, so you usually have a little bit more openness to a positive movement than a negative movement. We don't spend a lot of dollars to lock in the plan at any number like this. JonathanArnold: And then just, can I ask for a little, on Chile, I think you've said you're expecting to get it done this month. And so you have reckoned in Investor Day, I think you had said that you were sort of waiting on still making the NDRC filing in China, that's the last step. And that was hopefully going to be days away. So I'm just - can you give us a - has that now been made? Or is that statement about this month sort of based on expectations of when we reopen to be able to get that last piece done? JeffMartin: Thank you, very similar to what we're experiencing in Mexico, obviously the healthcare crisis is impacting; it's a global issue, right. But we talked about this a little bit when we talked about our capital recycling program and current liquidity in my prepared remarks. But, certainly, Jonathan, we feel like we've got momentum coming out of the approved deal, the conversations now are really around closing mechanic. Dennis, perhaps you can provide us some additional color about our confidence level for May. DennisArriola: Sure. Thanks, Jeff, and hi, Jonathan. Yes, basically, as Jeff mentioned, we're focused on getting this thing done. I think given the fact that, China really was closed down in March and April; there is some back up in some of the approvals that have been taken place. But I'll point you to one important fact here, Space Act, which is the commission in China that approves M&A type investments outside the country; it has already approved State Grid International's investment in Chile. So that's really important. Everything that we're hearing from the State Grid International executives and their advisors and conversations that I've had, personally had with Chairman Shu of State Grid International is, they want to get this thing closed as soon as possible. This is very strategic to their company going forward. And as Jeff mentioned we're now focused really on the details and the logistics related to the closing. As you'll recall in Peru, we were able to do this virtually and we're trying to get everything done even though there is limited travel in and out of Chile. But given where we're at and the commitment and the motivation by State Grid to get this thing done, we're expecting to get it done before the end of the month. Operator : And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. JulienSmith: Hey, good morning, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the time of you all well. Just a couple of clarifications, probably coming back on this, but just with respect to credit, I just want to clearly understand your expectations, both in respect, what are the current minimums the rating agencies are looking for versus the numbers I think, Trevor, you articulated just now to your year-end target? And then related to that, how do you think about ECA going FID, some of the other IEnova spending moving out, how does that all filter into what the rating agencies are looking for? And again, I'm just looking to understand this relative to the Moody's moves away. JeffMartin: So, I would just say that, as I've articulated earlier in today's call, Julien is that, we've spent a tremendous amount of time with all three agencies going back to the summer of 2017. And as we started a strategic repositioning of the Company, we laid out a set of metrics that we would guide to and that set of metrics was designed to a couple of things. Number one, we wanted on the qualitative side to make sure that we were taking steps to improve our business risk profile, at the same time that we made firm commitments around the balanced capital structure and moving to a 16% FFO to debt. So over the last three years, our targeted metrics have come down. We feel very comfortable about the commitments we've made. And what you're hearing Trevor say is, we're tracking to the commitments we've made in 2017 that were designed to make sure that we can maintain an investment grade plus credit rating. I do think Trevor has raised a good point. Some of the agencies have been more focused on whether the LNG business has a different risk profile. And I think what we point to there is, in contrast to 2017 where we were in construction mode, we're now in operating mode at Cameron and proceeding quite well toward Train 3 being online, that also will be very important. So I think what the agencies are looking for is, number one, can you complete your capital recycling program, and we're on track to do that in May of this year by closing Chile. Number two, can you Commission Train 3 on time, and then you may recall there are some guarantees related to the construction lending that falls away in the period of time after that. So we're tracking toward a basket of metrics that we've laid out going back to the summer of 2017. And we're also operationally, trying to hit our capital program produce high quality financial result and stick to our commitments around the capital recycling program. So Trevor made this comment that this is always a balance of interest, even having Port Arthur pushed into 2021, will take some pressure off those discussions. With each of the agencies, they have their own metrics that they evaluate and what we're trying to do is, we're trying to hit the ball right down the middle of the field, around the metrics that we committed to in 2017, we think our progress has been quite good. JulienSmith: Got it. Said differently, you articulated to the rating agencies back then and they are still committed to the same path. And they're taking whatever actions they deem appropriate, but at least from your perspective, you are following through, you work on doing exactly what you've told them a couple of years ago? JeffMartin: That's right. And look, we have great relationships with all of them. I mean this is a tough time for all of us, given the current market environment, I'm sure they are dealing with a lot of stuff too. We have very constructive relationships and what we're trying to do is, make sure in a very earnest way, Julien that we stick to the commitments that we've made regarding maintaining our investment-grade plus rating. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. MichaelLapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I [Tech Difficulty] can you just help us understand what - how much of the year-over-year uptick in the California Utilities is driven by the delay in the rate case? And how much is driven by what would have already recognized in the case in this year and if you could break it out for each of the utilities that would be great. JeffMartin: Michael, you'll recall that we got our rate case approved in Q4 of last year. And this was the first ramp-based decision that the Commission has faced where Kevin and Brett laid out all the different types of spending requirements relative to the risk that they were counting in their operating environment and, in round figures, you saw an approved revenue requirement for SDG&E, that was a CAGR of about 5.7% annually across the three years of the rate case and closer to 8.5% for SoCalGas. So these were very, very robust spending requirements around robust needs on the capital side. So we knew, in Q4, and you saw the recognition is that related back to January 1 of 2019, it was a very robust decision for us, and it gave us a lot more certainty around the spending we needed to have for safety and reliability. And as you come into this year, you're seeing that spending take place. The one catch up piece which you're referring to is the FERC decision that decision relates back to June 1 of 2019. I think the key takeaway as you think about the guidance discussion we've had in our prepared remarks and during the Q&A is that our three utilities in general are right on track on the capital program and they're doing a great job of making sure that they're managing a very, very safe workplace and a safe environment for the community. So a lot of what you're hearing us talk about is we have a very constructive view of the rate decision. So think about this, we got not only a three-year rate decision, we got our cost of capital confirmed, then we got our transmission cost of capital at FERC confirmed and now we're filing for the attrition mechanisms for years four and five. So effectively, you've got a five-year runway for your California Utilities on this rate case. You have a constructive attrition mechanism; you've locked in your cost of capital in the State of California. And just in the last six weeks, you've locked in your FERC cost of capital. So the level of visibility we have to a constructive regulatory environment in California is probably as high as it's ever been since I've been with the Company. MichaelLapides: Okay, thank you for that, Jeff. I just want to make sure that, if I'm looking at the Slide 14 that Trevor noted on, of that $174 million in year-over-year earnings with the Utilities, at the California Utilities, $120 million of that could have been recognized in the first quarter of '19, and something around $54 million of that is really kind of incremental to the first quarter of '20. Am I thinking about that right? JeffMartin: Yes, let me let Trevor speak to the specifics of that slide for you, Michael. TrevorMihalik: Yes, generally, Michael. If you look at that, the $174 million is the uplift from the rate case across the two utilities, but again because we got the rate case late in 2019, a piece of that are retroactive back and the piece that's retroactive, of the $174 million, it's roughly two-thirds retroactive. And then one-third is the continuing uplift from that number. So again, the $174 million is the full impact of the rate case. But if we had gotten the rate case on a timely basis, you could assume that roughly two-thirds of that $174 million would have been kind of not in a variance number. JeffMartin: Just I'll add is, I mean, because the Q1 of 2019 did not have rate case there. MichaelLapides: Understood, that's super helpful guys. And then one thing on Cameron, just the capital structure, can you remind us how much of that debt is bullet debt and how much of the debt is the amortizing debt? In the bullet debt, what kind of maturity schedule is that? Is it during the lifetime of the contract? Is it beyond the lifetime in the contract? How does that work? JeffMartin: I'll pass that to Faisel, who is handling that for us. FaiselKhan: Yes, there is - Michael there is more maturities and all these bonds are traded in the public market. But it's roughly a $3 billion of bond. Three of those are bullet maturities in '35 - sorry in 2035 and 2038 and 2031, the last one at 2039 bond is an amortizing bond. All of those bonds mature before the end of our contract date. Operator : And next will be Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. AnthonyCrowdell: Hi, good morning. Hopefully, I can ask one question and one follow-up. So, just specific to Port Arthur, the decision gets pushed until next year. Is the challenges related to that decision more on the demand side, the supply side or just the global economic overhang right now because of the virus? JeffMartin: Anthony, this is Jeff. I appreciate the question. We certainly think that what's unique about Port Arthur; you'll recall that that's the one Greenfield project we have in our portfolio. The other four are brownfield and have a cost advantage, and the real value of Port Arthur is its scale. So there are really three mega projects on the drawing board globally today. Arctic LNG, which is going forward in North Russia; the Qatari project, which has been delayed; and the Port Arthur project. And I think we've got the benefit of having Justin with us here today and maybe Justin, you can talk about where we're at on the marketing side and what you're doing to actually make that project more competitive. JustinBird: Yes. Thank you, Jeff, and thanks for the question, Anthony. So again, I think our permits of the LNG business are that we saw a need for additional infrastructure in the LNG space in the mid 2020s. We think North America will play a critical role in that and frankly we at Sempra think, on a risk adjusted basis, we can earn returns in excess of those of our utilities side. So, at Port Arthur, we see again a great opportunity, really, as Jeff said about the size and scale of that project. We are currently working with Aramco and with PGNIG as the optimal timing for this project. To the heart of your question, I think there are really three things. One would be the state of the financial markets. I think the ability to go out and project finance Port Arthur in the current market is somewhat limited. Second, to your point, is a bit of the marketing. I think in the short term, we see some uncertainty and unpredictability given what we're seeing in the oil prices. And the third thing I'd say is that we, at Sempra, in partnership with Bechtel, see some opportunities to potentially decrease the cost of the construction, given that we're seeing a global slowdown on large capital projects. So, we think frankly this project can be stronger, although delayed. We think it will be bring a better return to our investors and frankly be a better project for our customers. AnthonyCrowdell: Great. Thanks. And my follow-up, this is kind of, I guess, following up on Shar's question. The company has done a great job of recycling capital on the transition to more core assets; the LNG gets pushed out potential year, potentially longer. There's some dislocation in market values right now. Does the company look to replicate your success, maybe of what's going on the last two years with buying of Texas assets and looking at other assets in the U.S.? JeffMartin: So it's a good question, and I think that we have tried to be very, very disciplined on the management team and with our Board of Directors of laying out a strategic repositioning of the company, right. So we've had a pretty sweeping program over the last two plus years. I think the team has executed very well, I think, Dennis and Trevor and Kevin Sagara and others have all been part of that program. So we're very pleased with the fact that we've gone from being a Western Hemisphere focused company to being a North American focused company and specifically in North America, we're coming much more weighted toward U.S. utilities with less focus on California, more going toward Texas. I think one of the things I would take away from your question is, Oncor is a very unique opportunity, right, you had 80% position in a pure play T&D Company, probably the number one asset in America that had some distress around it and it was something we had looked at for a long period of time. So it was an opportunity, as part of capital recycling to go into Texas with a marquee purchase. But look, we don't, we don't talk about future M&A, really I think what we're really focused on is we have a very attractive capital program and we're going to execute it with a lot of discipline and focus. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. JeremyTonet: Good morning. Thanks for having me. Hi, good morning. Just wanted to kind of turn back. We have a couple of conversations here and just given the conversations that we've been having with regards to the Moody's outlook and kind of maybe their impression of the LNG side, just wondering if that - if it goes into how you think about future LNG expansion FIDs going forward or how you go about financing it? Any thoughts that you could share there? JeffMartin: No, I would just say that I think we're really excited about the progress we've made at Cameron, right? So as we bring the third train of Cameron on in Q3 of this year, that is a really valuable asset to us. We're going to be very, very disciplined. We talked about this at our Investor Day. Certainly, we've made a great step forward with ECA. Now, ECA is a smaller project of about 2.5 million tons per annum and I would also note that the tolling structure at Cameron was fairly unique and having now for the first time all three MOUs in place is a positive signal for Cameron. So yes, Port Arthur is slipping a little bit, but as we go into the future, what you should expect us to do is look at all sources of capital. There is a tremendous amount of low cost private equity capital out there today and we'll look to basically approach this business model as an adjacency with a very disciplined approach and we've said before, we think that we'll either get a much significantly higher equity return that we do in our utilities or we will not proceed on a project. So by seeing us announce the contracts that you've seen at ECA that should be validating to you that we're seeing the opportunity to proceed in a disciplined way that returns a lot of value to our shareholders. JeremyTonet: That's helpful, thanks. And then just a clean-up if I could, with regards to the Mexican CapEx, I think you said, it could be delayed and I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what type of CapEx that is and granted, it's a small part of the portfolio, but any sensitivity to EPS this year or next? JeffMartin: Look, obviously, Mexico is a little bit further behind the United States relative to the pandemic. And I think very similar to the path you saw us take at Sempra, where we want to make sure that we preserved our liquidity and our balance sheet strength as we headed into this environment, I think they're doing the same thing, they're making all the prudent moves you expect them to make at IEnova perhaps, Dennis you could comment on the steps they've taken to strengthen their balance sheet and liquidity and how you're thinking about the CapEx program for 2020? DennisArriola: Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Jeff and Hi, Jeremy. Yes, from an IEnova standpoint, I think they're doing all the right things as Jeff said. Number one was they strengthened their overall liquidity position and cash and available credit lines, close to $1 billion as of right now. They've been focused on operating expenses, those things that don't need to be spent, are not being spent. And from a CapEx perspective, what I would tell you is that the Company, the management team in Mexico is really been focused on getting done those projects that are near completion. If you think about the storage terminals and some of the other projects that we have that are nearly done, those are going to be completed. In other cases, we're looking at other projects where we don't have all the - the full approvals or permits and talking with our customers to see if it makes sense for both parties to potentially push off or delay CapEx. So no major announcements to be made there today other than I think we're taking a very prudent look at what's happening in Mexico. I think we continue to believe that the energy picture in Mexico over the long term is a really positive one and IEnova is better positioned and anyone to take advantage of that, but I think the management team there is being very prudent about its resources. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. RyanLevine: Hi. Given the extensive cost cutting review that Sempra has completed over the last few years, does COVID-19 bring to light any additional opportunities across the business portfolio? JeffMartin: Yes, it's interesting that you asked that question. I think that we're all learning about flexible work schedules and the value of working remotely. I mean, the building that I'm in currently, we've had almost practically all of our corporate staff working from home. So one of the things we're doing under the leadership of our Chief Human Resources Officer is part of the task force that Dennis heads up is, we're going to do an enterprise-wide look at how we think about workspace relative to people that can work from home, even though our Utilities today, which have been deemed essential workers, we have a large workforce in the field. We also have a lot - several thousand people working from home as well. So you're absolutely right. We've had two different cost initiatives over the last two years, led by the parent company and we will review as we transition folks back to work, what office space is needed and what type of changes we make to flexible working, but this is probably something that almost every business will be reviewing as they try to find ways to support their employees improve productivity and perhaps find ways to take more cost out of their business. But thank you for asking that question. RyanLevine: Okay. And then one related to Texas. Thank you for the disclosure around the 90% pre-approved CapEx spending through 2021 within Oncor. Is there any color you're able to share for 2022 and beyond in terms of the CapEx that already has pre-approval with ESGP? JeffMartin: We laid out at our Investor Day, kind of the five-year numbers for each of our business, what leads around the utilities and their total number, there is $11.9 billion, and what he was speaking to was obviously the certainty he had in '20 and '21. We haven't provided forward guidance relative to the certainty of the 2023 through 2024 numbers, but we feel very good about the capital program. And I think one thing that would make you feel a little bit better Ryan is, in the Investor Day presentation, Allen laid out another roughly $1 billion of capital in addition to the $11.9 billion and that provides that we made at Investor Day was, don't think about that as incremental capital to the $11.9 billion, it really gave Allen and Jim Greer and the team the opportunity that if one project slipped, they had plenty of other projects, whether it was maintenance CapEx or otherwise, that they can slip in there. So I think it was our perspective that, that incremental capital slide really was intended to give us confidence that there is $11.9 billion capital program there over five years. Operator : And our next question will come from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. SophieKarp: Hi, good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to have a quick follow-up on Texas. From not to beat this horse to death, I guess, but I think the perception has been historically that you like Texas and you wanted to get potentially bigger in Texas. Is that wrong or is it just the timing is not right, you are being more cautious on that. Could you maybe comment on that a little bit? Thank you. JeffMartin: Sure. I think if you went back to our 2017 numbers, roughly 70% or just over 70% of the earnings composition of Sempra came from our California Utilities and we think California is a very constructive regulatory environment. We felt like longer term, we were looking for opportunities to get more regulatory diversity. We also think that Texas is a good role model by having their retail market separate and they have a pure T&D model. So as we thought about our strategy, our desire to have more of a bond like portfolio where we were not exposed to as much downstream consumer risk, nor exposed to upstream commodity or generation risks, the Texas marketplace very much reflects how we think about the best risk-reward for our stakeholders. So we certainly, we like the marketplace, we like it even in today's climate. I think as you heard Allen and the team talk about, the certainty they have around their capital program and their earnings forecast, it's really all the reasons why we wouldn't be in that marketplace and you saw us add to that portfolio with InfraREIT and we've announced that the opening of the Houston office to support our LNG growth. Even though Justin's team has delayed Port Arthur, if where Port Arthur to go forward that will be the largest civil works project in North America, right. So Texas is really is a market of priority for us. I think it achieves a lot - it checks a lot of boxes we think about strategically. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Jeff Martin for any closing or additional remarks. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot. Well, look as we look to close the call, I want to thank all the employees that have joined to get an update on their Company and thank everyone from the sell-side and the buy-side community for listening in today. We know you have a lot of options in terms of where you invest your time and there were certainly some other calls going on concurrently. But we appreciate it, having the opportunity to update you on our results. Most importantly, hope everyone stays safe during these challenging times. I appreciate all of you joining and free to reach out to our IR team per custom with any additional questions. This concludes today's call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Faisel Khan. Please go ahead. Faisel Khan : Good morning. And welcome to Sempra Energy\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section. Several members of our management team are on the line with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra LNG,; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Kevin Sagara, Group President; and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. All the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. I would also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 5, 2020 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Faisal and thank you all for joining us today. Two years ago we laid out a strategic plan to divest non-core assets and reposition our business in the most attractive growth markets right here in North America. The plan also called for concentrating our investments in a more narrow segment of the energy value chain with the goal of improving our financial results. I'm proud to report that our strategy is working. You recall that our financial results in 2019 significantly exceeded our original guidance and this year we're pleased that increased our 2020 EPS guidance range, completed our capital rotation program, generating total gross proceeds of $8.3 billion, continued executing our utility-centered capital program while deferring about $500 million of infrastructure capital and at the end of last week we reached substantial completion at Cameron Train 3 with commercial operations and full cash flows from all three trains expected in the coming days. Given the quality and strength of our earnings and particularly the visibility we now have to our future growth, we believe recent share price performance doesn't reflect the value of our company nor its growth prospects. Because of this we've made the decision to buy back $500 million of our stock and received approval from our board for a new authority of $2 billion for share repurchases. We're committed to being prudent stewards of your capital and will continue to look for ways to drive additional value back to our shareholders. Turning to our financial results for the quarter, we are benefiting from more concentrated investments in our T&D portfolio. Our adjusted earnings results for the first half of 2020 are up over 50% when compared to last year primarily driven by the results by U.S. utilities and Cameron. We're already touched on our revised EPS guidance range for 2020 but I'd like to also highlight that we're also affirming our 2021 EPS guidance range as well. Now please turn to slide 5 where I'll provide an overview of our recently completed capital rotation program. The sale of our Chilean businesses in June for approximately $2.2 billion was the final transaction in our strategic capital rotation program and really sets us up well for the future. When we set out on this path at the end of 2017 we had just finished the year with adjusted earnings per share of $5.42. Since then we've recycled approximately $27 billion in firm value back into our business with the focus on T&D infrastructure. Invested close to $16 billion of growth capital at our utility and infrastructure businesses and raised the midpoint of our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range from $7.10 to $7.50 close to a 40% projected increase over our 2017 results. Our company-wide commitment to operational excellence has led to the strong execution of this strategy and our employees deserve a ton of credit. We are today, more strategically focused, more profitable and more optimistic about our future growth prospects and it's all tied to making further progress on our mission to build North America's premier energy infrastructure company. Please turn to the next slide. Our ongoing focus on safety and reliability remains paramount and is a critical component of our overall mission. Here at Sempra our number one priority continues to be the health and well-being of all of our employees, customers and the communities we serve. We've built a strong safety and performance culture throughout our organization. I could not be more proud of the ongoing commitment and dedication of all of our employees to providing essential, safe and reliable service to over 35 million consumers. We also continue to support our communities through charitable giving donating over $13 million to local health and welfare areas since the start of the pandemic. As we look ahead we're continuing to plan for the safe re-entry back to the workplace. We continue to be thoughtful and strategic about returning to the office in a phased approach that considers specific work locations and personnel requirements while adhering to the latest safety guidelines. From an operational perspective we built a strong and sustainable business that can successfully operate in a variety of challenging environments by decoupled revenues that are T&D utilities in California, investments in the largest T&D provider in Texas with no exposure to generation and regulatory protection from retail risk, tolling contracts with A rated customers that are also our equity partners at cameron LNG and critical operating infrastructure in Mexico with dollar denominated long-term contracts with an average tenor in excess of 20 years. Our strong financial results year-to-date highlight this sustainable business model. Please turn to the next slide. Across our businesses we're investing in the portion of the energy value chain that we believe will provide the best risk adjusted returns. Nearly all of our five-year capital plans expected to be invested in transmission and distribution projects. Through our narrowed geographic footprint sustainable business model and focus on T&D investments. We believe we've created an infrastructure portfolio with strong cash flows to support a growing dividend and improved visibility to future earnings growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Trevor to discuss our capital allocation approach as well as our operational and financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks Jeff. As already discussed we believe we've built a business model that can weather the current health and economic crisis and emerge stronger and more profitable. We've been consistent with our capital allocation approach by prioritizing our utility centered capital plan, optimizing our balance sheet and returning value to our shareholders. Despite our demonstrated capabilities and superior dividend growth our stock has underperformed this year and trades at a relative discount compared to our peers. In light of this and in an effort to continue returning value to our shareholders, we're announcing that we have completed a $500 million share repurchase program. This $500 million has exhausted the previous $2 billion authorization that we had outstanding since 2007 as part of a previous capital recycling program. Therefore, our board recently authorized an incremental $2 billion of share repurchases providing the flexibility to buy back shares on an opportunistic basis. Please turn to slide 9. We have a strong track record of returning value to our shareholders. Since 2000 we've repurchased approximately 74 million common shares totaling $3 billion and we've consistently grown our common stock dividend with $10 billion return to shareholders. Please turn to slide 10, where I'll discuss operational updates. SDG&E continues to be a leader in wildfire mitigation and has invested over $2 billion in this effort since 2007. The CPUC recently approved SDG&E wildfire mitigation plan and we've successfully procured wildfire insurance in excess of the $1 billion requirement in compliance with AV 1054. These insurance premiums are balanced as part of the 2019 GRC decision. We continue to innovate and advance our leadership position in this area through our fire safe 3.0 program combining technology and over 10 years of data. At SoCalGas we received a proposed decision for approval to recover $806 million related to our pipeline safety enhancement plan. In addition to our continued focus on safely and reliably serving our customers we're making significant headway on our sustainable clean energy goals. We remain on track to meet our goal to procure 5% renewable natural gas for our core customers by 2022. Separately we continue to advance a regulatory program that will allow SoCalGas\u2019s customers to buy renewable natural gas for their homes and businesses along with working with legislators to advance a renewable gas portfolio standard. The company is also collaborating with several partners on a number of hydrogen demonstration and pilot projects. As the largest gas utility in the U.S. we believe our scale and commitment to innovation allows us to support renewable natural gas, hydrogen and other technologies required to meet the state's clean energy goals in a way that promotes resiliency of the system and affordability for our customers. Shifting to Texas. Oncor continues to execute on its capital plan. Oncor connected over 20, 000 new premises in the second quarter and over 38,500 new premises year-to-date. On the transmission side, Oncor is on pace to set a record for interconnection requests in 2020 predominantly driven by an increase in solar generation activity. Through July there were approximately 270 transmission interconnection requests which compares to 300 requests for all of 2019. Despite the impacts of COVID-19 Oncor believes it will continue to have steady increases in interconnection requests for the remainder of 2020. Overall Texas continues to be one of the most resilient markets in the country and ERCOT system expects to hit a new summer peak load later this year. Please turn to slide 11 where I'll discuss developments at the Sempra LNG and Sempra Mexico business units. Beginning with Cameron LNG phase 1 as Jeff said we're pleased that Train 3 has reached substantial completion with commercial operations expected in the coming days. The facility is expected to provide nearly $12 billion dollars of after-debt service cash flows to Sempra during the 20-year tolling agreement with no commodity or volumetric exposure and is supported by its A-rated customers and partners. Moving to Mexico. Despite the current market challenges we strongly believe in the long-term fundamentals of delivering cleaner and more affordable energy to the people of Mexico. Tanya and her team are prudently managing IEnova's business while helping to ensure the continuity of safe and reliable operations. IEnova continues to be disciplined with regards to capital allocation by strategically deferring capital and executing on its share repurchase program. In fact, across North American infrastructure businesses we've deferred about a $0.5 billion of capital in 2020 as a result of the current market environment. Moving to our development projects, ECA LNG phase 1 has uptake in EPC contracts in place and is ready to move forward with a final investment decision subject to receiving the Mexican export permit. We continue to work closely with local authorities as well as the highest levels of the Mexican government on advancing the permit process. Separately I'd like to address the recent commercial contract developments at the ECA regassification facility. Two customers are alleging that an update of the general terms and conditions for service of the facility resulted in a forced measure and breach of the existing contracts. We believe these allegations are meritless and ECA has notified these customers that they are in breach of their obligations. We're examining all of our options in light of the timing and baselessness of the claims and plan to vigorously exercise our rights and remedies in all available forums. We don't believe that the initiation of arbitration by one of the customers will delay the ongoing steps to FID on the ECA phase 1 liquefaction project. at Cameron LNG phase 2 we've signed MOUs with Total, Mitsui and Mitsubishi and are working on the preliminary front-end design studies. We're excited about this opportunity and believe that the incremental capacity at the existing Cameron facility should provide very competitive pricing for our customers. Given the current market environment, we continue to target FID on Port Arthur in 2021. We're working with our current and potential customers and remain disciplined on how we allocate capital to the project. ultimately demand from customers will drive the timing of Port Arthur. We continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of the LNG market and Sempra's competitive position. We see long-term value in our projects and believe that our financial strength and the strategic locations of our development projects provide us with competitive advantages over others in the industry. Please turn to slide 12. Looking at our financial results this was another strong quarter. Earlier this morning we reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.239 billion or $7.61 per share. This compares to second quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $354 million or $1.26 per share. On an adjusted basis second quarter 2020 earnings were $485 million or $1.65 per share. This compares favorably to our second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of $309 million or $1.10 per share. Please turn to slide 13. The variance in the second quarter 2020 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following key items. $126 million of higher earnings at the California utilities from the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 associated with an income tax expense memorandum account that tracked differences between the actual and forecasted estimates from 2016 to 2018. $75 million of higher earnings at the California utilities from higher CPUC base operating margin net of operating expenses primarily driven by the timing of the 2019 GRC decision. $65 million of higher earnings from Cameron going into service and $31 million of higher earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities primarily driven by the increased consumption due to weather, updated rates reflecting increases in invested capital and the impact of Oncor's acquisition of infrared in May of 2019. This was offset by $49 million of lower earnings from discontinued operations in South America mainly as a result of the sale of our Peruvian businesses in April and $32 million of lower earnings apparent another due to income tax items as well as losses on foreign currency derivatives related to the sale of our South American businesses. Please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks Trevor. Sempra continues to lead the sector in sustainability as highlighted by our strong ratings. In May, we published our 12th consecutive corporate sustainability report. We're extremely proud of the progress we're making on the environmental, social and governance front and this year's report provides a great snapshot of our most recent initiatives and our latest results. Our sustainability report also highlights how we champion diversity. In fact, across the Sempra family of companies that we control 62% are persons of color and in our parent company the majority of all of our employees are women. We are also quite proud of our board of directors where 62% are women or persons of color. I'm very proud of our employees who continue to live out our company values. At Sempra we do the right thing; champion people and shape the future. Please turn the next slide. We're pleased to report a very successful quarter both operationally and financially benefiting from a more narrow strategic focus we recently raised our full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range and are also reaffirming our full year 2021 EPS guidance range. We remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value and I cannot be more pleased with our overall financial performance even in these challenging market conditions. And with that this concludes our prepare remarks and we'll stop to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partner. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. It's actually [indiscernible] here stepping in for Shahriar. Congrats on the great quarter. Jeff Martin : Thanks [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : We have a couple of questions. One on kind of the capital allocation decisions that were announced here and the stock buybacks a bit of a departure from prior language on capital allocation. We are curious on kind of what sorts of time frames are you looking at for that $2 billion and can you get a bit more sense on the rationales kind of buyback versus de-levering versus reinvestment specifically more from like a strategic perspective kind of the option that you're kind of announcing today indicates some lack of efficient redeployment in the near term and just thinking about like M&A allocation couldn't bring any considerations on the Oncor stake and/or any other opportunities in [indiscernible] jurisdictions. Jeff Martin : Thanks [indiscernible]. There is a few questions in there. So I'll try to take in order. If I miss one please circle back. I'll be glad to address that. I would just start with one of the comments we made in our prepared remarks which is that we really feel like we're getting great traction with our strategy. We've set a course just over two years ago to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company and to do that we elected to exit South America and sell some non-core assets that generated about $8.3 billion of pre-tax proceeds which we've been able to effectively recycle back here into our core businesses particularly here in the United States. So what we've been number one focused on from a capital allocation standpoint is funding our $32 billion five-year capital program. The lion's share of that as you know is in our utilities. So our first obligation is to always make sure that we meet the resource requirements in Oncor SDG&E SoCalGas particularly in the areas of safety and reliability. Second, we've made some definitive commitments around strengthening our balance sheet. We set forth our credit targets for the end of the year namely around debt to cap and our FFO targets which are reflected in the slides. We feel good about where we're at but I will say that we feel quite strongly that the utility sector has underperformed the broader market by about 6% this year and our stock is likewise underperformed within the sector and we think we have a very strong top tier growth and income story and that's why we've taken some steps in this market environment to defer some capital which Trevor referenced in his prepared remarks about $500 million out of this year into 2021 and that's created room for us to make sure that we're thoughtful to support our stock. So we were very pleased to be able to use up the remaining authorization from 2007 and the commitment and authorization from our board really is to replenish that and we're not going to talk about specifically how we might put that authority to work but I think our past practices of being opportunistic to support our stock at these levels should guide your thoughts in that area. Secondly, you raise this issue of M&A and I think that our practice has been that we don't as a convention talk about forward-looking acquisition activities but I do think there's always benefit to talk about the lens by which we look at M&A activity and Constantine it typically starts with looking at assets that fit our strategy. Second we look at assets where we think we can bring deep expertise to trying to operate them more effectively and then thirdly, obviously price matters. We're always looking to pay a fair price and if we can obviously a dislocation price is helpful. But if you think about our approach to energy future holdings, remember this was a asset that was in bankruptcy and we were able to extend our T&D strategy into Texas which has been a core priority and we did that at a very attractive price and then we went from that one to [indiscernible] which was very similar position great basket of assets. I think we picked that up for something around 16 times earnings which is a great price for the quality of those T&D assets. So when you think about where we're at today we've talked about this larger management team with low interest rates and credit spreads it's surprising to see utilities trade at a discounts and market and if you look at and we've reviewed a lot of sell side research in this area. I've looked at Wolf, Baml, Goldman, UBS and others and it's clear that there's a lot of value in our sector today and I think it's one of the reasons when we think about M&A the one area that we feel like that really fits our strategy and also where we have deep expertise and there is a really attractive price opportunity is with Sempra stock. So I mean we're pretty much pounding the table. We've got a top-tier growth and income story here and that's one of the reasons that we were opportunistic this summer and pleased to go into the marketplace to purchase $500 million of our own stock. So we have a $32 billion capital program underway that is 100% of our focus but at the same time we're going to be aggressive to continue to look for opportunities to be opportunistic going forward. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Yes. That's going in clarifies a bit and just a quick follow-up hydrogen has been kind of a topic of interest recently and California and [indiscernible] are kind of leading the way in the conversation with R&D. What's your outlook on kind of implementing this technology? Any potential CapEx allocation in the near-term, I guess five-year plan as an upside? And are you seeing kind of the regulatory support in California for these type of projects or is it a little early? Jeff Martin : Yes. Well, I appreciate you asking this question. This is something that's a high area of interest to us. I also appreciate your recognition of the great R&D work that's been taking place at SDG&E in SoCalGas I'll provide a little bit of color Constantine and pass it to Kevin Sagara who's the group president over California but I think it starts with the fact that over the last three to five years this has been a priority in our company. So we own the largest natural gas franchise in the western hemisphere. We serve 22 million consumers right here in California, their basic natural gas needs and we made the decision in the last several years that we were leading this space. When you think of broad categories where we're spending time either on R&D basis or projects there's probably 8 to 10 different projects that we're looking at. They fall into the categories of transportation refueling, primarily focused on heavy duty vehicles, blending opportunities into power generation, blending opportunity into compressor stations at SoCalGas and really the opportunity to co-locate some of these facilities and take advantage of cost efficiencies with our LNG facilities, but we're also trying to take a leadership position Constantine in some of the major trade associations like the hydrogen council and we're collaborating with the countries we think that are leading this field today primarily Japan and Germany. So we're quite bullish from the role of hydrogen and renewable natural gas particularly here in California. You think about the energy transition that's in front of our sector and the one that's in front of the world particularly in the developing world hydrogen is going to play an increasingly important role. It's still a little bit early but I think you're raising a good point. The time now to create a leadership position is the work we're doing inside of our utilities currently and Kevin perhaps she could provide some additional color. Kevin Sagara : Thanks Jeff. As you mentioned it is a little early but California has always led the way in this area of clean energy and this time I expect it will be no different. Having just come off of being the CEO of SDG&E which is a leader in renewable energy we've top solar electric vehicles and having led Sempra renewables I'm all in on hydrogen. The gas company we're speaking to all of the leading industry players that you would expect us to be speaking to. We've got several exciting projects in development. Today we're participating in projects that make biomethane from solar power and recaptured CO2 and others that make green hydrogen from solar power and water. As Jeff mentioned, we see opportunity in power generation, industrial processes. We're fueling needing and heavy duty transportation. We see opportunities within our own system. We believe hydrogen will play a key role in the 21st century energy system and you can expect that our infrastructure at the California utilities will be right smack dab in the middle of it. Both utilities are working on several exciting hydrogen projects that we'll be announcing in the upcoming quarters and so if you don't hear it in my voice yes I am really excited about hydrogen and I think there's a big opportunity here and our utilities are going to be a big part of it and it's great our infrastructure is well-positioned to play a big role. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. I think that's very-very helpful. Thanks so much. I will jump back in queue. Jeff Martin : Thanks Constantine. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Hey. Thanks for the question. I guess first of all the $500 million of preferred CapEx which part of the business did that come from? Jeff Martin : I would start by saying see that we're obviously committed to our $32 billion capital program but with this current market backdrop we've really pushed on the near term into the capital program. This is really 100% coming from our non-utility businesses primarily LNG but we've moved capital related to ECA into next year some capital we've also deferred some capital related to our storage businesses in Mexico but it shouldn't have any meaningful impact on 2020 or 2021. Steve Fleishman : Okay and is there any the $2 billion incremental authorization that's just, it's not like a timeline or it's really [indiscernible] would you fair to say? Jeff Martin : No. There's no timeline but I think is that as I articulated to Constantine, I think our past practices would guide how we would look to use that. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then a couple just issues that have popped up that I guess I get questions on recently has been this first San Diego franchise issue and then I guess this recent filing you guys made on clarifying lobbying and how that should be treated. Can you just maybe go through those two issues and your take on them? Jeff Martin : Sure. I'll take your second question first and come back to the franchise agreement but in California for a long period of time various industrial utilities would be looking to promote one deal on regulation or another and I think the goal always is to get to the best long-term energy policies in the state and because there's sometimes a lack of clarity about what type of activities require use from ratepayer dollars versus shareholder dollars, we felt like that ambiguity is your enemy. So we felt like that for the benefit of the industry it was worth having a lot of clarity. So we filed an OIR to make sure there's a process around this with a lot of transparency and allow all five commissioners and their staff to weigh in on it. So we feel good about taking that step and I think it will add some clarity for all the participants in the industry. On the San Diego franchise, I would probably offer you three different comments here Steve. First, the city charter in San Diego always requires a competitive process to renew it. Mayor falls during the city council I think are doing all the things that you expect them to be doing. So running the competitive process. It's open and transparent. They've augmented their staff with some outside consultants and all this is being done with the view towards getting the best outcome for the residents of the city. I think that leads to my second point, which is we have close to 300 franchises across the state of California. So we're always evaluating 10 or 12 of these at a time and our approach we tend to be to focus on each of these as an opportunity for us to get better as a company. And you have to remind yourself there is a strong alignment of interest that those same residents of the city are also our customers. So we're always trying to find new and better ways to serve them and you have to remember these are customers that date back their relationship with our company back in the 1800s we first started serving customers here in the region in 1881. But let me tell you what I'm confident about SG&E is well-positioned to be the best partner for the city. I think the three things that we've tried to talk about with the team at SDG&E is that's a company that leads our nation in clean energy with rooftop solar here locally at a 15% penetration rate that's a remarkable number and a credit to the support from the utility and historically we've always been charging roughly 45% procurement for renewable generation which is also an industry-leading position. In the last 14 years, we've been consistently named the number one utility in the West for a liability and that goes back to your safety and safety metrics where we have a really outsized lead compared to other utilities and finally just two or three weeks ago we were named the number one investor on utility United States at SDG&E for their commitment and demonstrated expertise in innovation technology. So if you think about some of our accomplishments Steven you followed the company for a long period of time, I think the one thing that's kind of common about our success historically has been the broad partnership that San Diego gas electric has with the local [IBW] and labor generally. This is a century-old partnership here in San Diego that's always privileged safety and good improved utility practice and procedure. I think it's been central to our success and I think as we approach this opportunity with the city we're going to approach it from the standpoint that you're always good to have a little dose of humility and try to find the best way to put your foot forward. Our goal is to put the best value proposition from the city and we have a fair amount of confidence we can do that. Steve Fleishman : Okay. That's very helpful. I have been getting a lot of questions. So helpful to clarify those two things. Thank you Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Smith with Bank of America. Julien Smith : Hey good morning, thank you for the time guys. If I can follow up, Jeff Martin : Hey Julien Julien Smith : Hey good morning Jeff. If I can follow up with the first round of questions here Jeff just to follow up here on the M&A question. Speaking of questions that we've been getting inbound there's been a lot of consternation of the market around M&A specifically and I'm hearing from you all on your call a very close focus on value in your own shares. Can you try to put the square those two a little bit more narrowly maybe said differently we really hear about companies articulating frameworks around M&A from one of the premium names if I can put it that way? Can you perhaps frame the buyback in the context of M&A? Is the buyback really a placeholder in your mind relative or what's your level of confidence in pursuing this buyback and seeing it through relative to alternative capital opportunities that pop up here? Jeff Martin : Hey Jo, I hate to do this to you that you came up, you came in broken up on the front end of your question. Would you mind repeating it for me please? Julien Smith : Sorry about that. Specifically on M&A there's a lot of consternation in the market around how you all are to what extent you are engaged on M&A conversation. You're very focused on the value of your stock here and on the call. Can you square your level of commitment to the buyback against a broader array of capital allocation opportunities whether that's in the context of more [indiscernible] base at the utilities or as I started the question with around M&A more broadly? Jeff Martin : Well, I would be pleased to answer that. I would say that in the past and currently we have had no formal discussions regarding M&A activities. It is not in our field of view currently. I think what you should hear from my prior comments is that we have, what we think is a unique opportunity in our industry with really unparalleled visibility to our capital employment through 2024 and in Part Julian that goes back to the quality of the rate case. We got at SoCalGas and SDG&E last year. Our goal is to fund that capital program, meet our credit commitments that we've been pretty clear about relative to credit rating agencies and protecting our balance sheet. If we have opportunities where we can move capital or defer capital within our program, you should expect us to be opportunistic with their own stock but in general when you think your stock is trading at such a deep discount as we think ours is we should be trying to find every opportunity we can to repurchase that. So I'm not making commitments about how we will use the $2 billion of authority from our board but I am telling you that our focus is on number one the organic growth program that we have and right now it makes a lot more sense to buy something at a discount before you'd allocate capital something you'd be buying at a premium. Julien Smith : Thanks for the emphasis. If I can turn back to Steve's question very quickly, what is this process around the franchise arrangement look like? If you talk about a partnership how would you frame the process going forward for investors from here? Jeff Martin : I think that the invitation to bid falls under the auspices of the mayor's office. I think there's a meeting in San Diego tomorrow where the level approach to the ITB or the investment to bid is being presented to the council. Yet another opportunity for a lot of open transparent input from the council to that process and probably over the next two to four weeks the invitation to bid would come out and then we would expect to participate in that process with the view that we would be submitting bid some time probably in the second half of October but look. I can tell you that this has been a priority for our company for a long period of time. These are types of discussions that have been going on for years not weeks or months and there is a lot of commitment to make sure that don't take these types of things for granted and I think we're very-very proud of our company at SDG&E and its commitment to the community. And as I said in my prior comments is the best way you're successful and obviously we manage 300 of these up and down the state of California is you approach them Julia with a little bit of humility and always from the mindset that we have a chance to get better and our job as a modern energy company to find new and better ways to serve customers and that's exactly the approach that the SDG&E will be taking with the city. Julien Smith : Appreciate it. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Jeff Martin : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Morning. Just want to touch on a bit of the questions maybe it was picked up earlier here but given some of the recent moves in the industry here how do you feel about the current regulated versus non-regulated business mix that you have? Do you see opportunities to kind of shift towards regulated more or you kind of are happy with where you're at? Jeff Martin : That's a great strategic question. This is one that we review with our board on a periodic basis. We've even got discussions with our board on the same topic later this year. Look we certainly privilege the utility side of our business. It represents roughly 80% of our earnings stack. What intrigues this and I mentioned this one of the earlier calls is as we think about our IEnova business we certainly think there is going to be a lot of reassuring and onshoring. I had a good fortune of attending the Bilal discussions and dinner with President Trump and President Lopez Obrador just a couple weeks ago and there's a tremendous amount of collaboration taking place across all three nations under USMCA and a lot of opportunity for new business and factories and particularly in the pharmaceutical industry to relocate here. So I think it's intriguing for us to think about how we look at the IEnova business which we also think is undervalued we have been actively inside IEnova business buying back those shares. So there's a share repurchase program that has been underway there as well quite active this year by the way and as we think about our LNG business. So there is more work to be done here but I think one of the things that's intriguing is probably less about whether the percentage is 80% of the mix or 90% of the mix but Jeremy what made me more interesting is how you make sure that those businesses that are not utilities are not consuming the balance sheet of the parent company. So you see I've seen other companies in our sector do this but the more we can think about having access to the unique growth profile that we have in our unregulated businesses and increasingly over time make sure it's not impacting our parent company and that debt is off balance sheet I think that's a real opportunity for our company. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful there and then maybe just kind of pivoting over to the LNG business it looks like nice kind of pick up and flows the Cameron and then steadily moving up there and although the LNG market is a bit difficult right now just wondering if you could provide any more color as far as commercial conversations might be having there. If tone or the pace has changed at all granted you're talking more about a 2021 FID with Port Arthur but just want to touch base on that and see how things were progressing? Jeff Martin : I'll be glad to provide some comments and that's if Justin if you'll make some color I'll pass it to you in a second but what I would say interesting if you start Jeremy at the macro level, what's unique is that the northern hemisphere had a very mild winter. Storage levels as we came into the late spring were relatively full and you've seen an impact in natural gas demand globally related to the pandemic. I think the most recent IEA forecasts are expecting natural gas demand to decline for the year by about 4% but what's interesting inside the LNG category it's actually gone up. So global demand for LNG in the first half of the year is one of the few commodities it's actually up close to 2% U.S. LNG exports for this six month period compared to last year are up 70% and that's a function a lot of the new capacity has come online in the last 12 to 18 months including Cameron and interestingly Europe's consumption of LNG is up 18% in the first six months. So there's clearly an opportunity where LNG is actually price competitive. So many countries indigenous supply of natural gas Thailand would be an example. They're landing LNG at a price that's cheaper in Thailand and they can actually produce it in their own economy. So I think that there is continued green shoots and optimism about LNG but what we've been trying to focus on and I think our LNG team has been pretty redundant on this is we've always had a long-held view that that second wave of LNG infrastructure which is intended to allow for deliveries in the middle part of the decade that is a very real opportunity. The LNG is going to play a very-very big role in reformulating the energy stack globally. Roughly 80% of future energy demand will come from the developing world and I think this market is going to be led by Asia and specifically China and the subcontinent of India. So there's a big opportunity there and I think this pandemic, if anything is causing some LNG buyers to delay their decision and it's also causing other infrastructure providers to get behind or fall by the wayside. So I think we've got a strong balance sheet. We have a very clear-eyed vision of what we want to accomplish in LNG and it always comes back to what your competitive advantages are and I think our approach of having competitive low-cost brownfield sites that can just dispatch directly into the Pacific and directly into Atlantic is an advantage that no other LNG infrastructure provider has in North America but let me stop there and Justin if you'd like to provide a little bit of color about where we're at with both ECA contracts, Cameron expansion contracts in Port Arthur. Justin Bird : Thank you Jeff and thank you Jeremy for the question. I think as Jeff said I think on the supply side we've seen a period where there has been a significant, I think it's around 8% per year growth rate in LNG supply and the consultants and we think as well that that will dramatically slow down as the market has changed. We think that may end up growing only around 1%. So we think the supply growth will decrease as demand increases and it's really an opportunity for world-class projects like ours to move forward. In terms of our conversations at Port Arthur as we've said we're targeting 2021. This is a customer demand driven project. We are engaged with [indiscernible] Saudi Aramco and many other customers. As Jeff mentioned there has been a slowdown in the market as a result of COVID-19 and economic slowdown. It's also the LNG business is adjusting to teleconferences and virtual meetings which has really historically been a face-to-face business that required a lot of international travel with the slowdown. That definitely has slowed down the process but again we think over time that will pick back up and we think given the competitive advantage of our projects those will move forward. In terms of Cameron expansion we've announced that we have emerald use for the full volume there. We are working with the partners on conceptual work around the expansion and really trying to optimize that expansion from a cost basis and from a timing perspective. So we do continue to see long-term growth in the LNG business but again we take a very disciplined capital allocation approach. We will build the projects when they have contracts and when the customer demand is there and when our partners want us to move forward. Jeremy Tonet : Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Sophie Karp : Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for the time. Jeff Martin : Thanks Sophie. Thank you. Sophie Karp : Yes. A lot of my questions have been answered but I just wanted to see if you could maybe give us a little more color on Mexico and what's happening there just overall how you view that geography in your mix going forward. It's the last outside outside of the U.S. I guess geography in the mix and I'm just curious to hear a little bit more color on what you see on the ground there. Thank you. Jeff Martin : So Sophie just to make sure I understand your question. You like a little bit more color on Mexico as a country and some of the macroeconomic developments? Sophie Karp : Correct that and the political landscape there as well and how that affects energy development. So a little bit any update on your views there if there is? Could be helpful. Jeff Martin : Sure. Look I think Sempra has been an investor in Mexico for 22 years. We have roughly a $10 billion investment in Mexico in all aspects of the energy infrastructure business. It continues to be a country that we think has a great macro story. This is the number 15 economy in the world pre-COVID our internal forecast felt Sophie that this might be as a number 7 economy in the world by 2040. Remember it's 130 million consumers and it's one of the fastest growing consumer markets in the western hemisphere. You raised some good points. There certainly has been some disruption in terms of how the Marina party has been administering the government and his approach to energy generally like I tell you I had the good fortune of going to dinner with President L\u00f3pez Obrador and President Trump two weeks ago there is true warmth and authenticity to that relationship. Obviously the conversation two years ago or three years ago was more around the border and today there is broad recognition of the joint opportunity between both countries as they've set a priority of being able to bring back business and factories from Asia. So I think there's a real near-term opportunity for collaboration and we think there's an opportunity for energy companies like ours. They're not really a Canadian or U.S. or Spanish or Italian company. This is a Mexican business that we own 67% of in Mexico. It's one of the top 10 or 12 companies on the Balsa. They have scale. They've got great relationships. They've got the expertise and our goal is to make sure that we put forward a great value proposition every time we have the opportunity to work with the government. As you know our business down there is increasing one of a bilateral business with CNI customers and increasingly less reliance on the state-owned agency. So I think near-term there is a lack of clarity around some of the policies that can impact the marketplace. We think the long-term macro story is intact. Sophie Karp : Perfect. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to go back to green hydrogen and Sempra certainly has been a thought leader there. While we're certainly excited about the growth in green hydrogen. I'm wondering just at a high level your thoughts on when green hydrogen would be economically viable for the utility sector? We can see applications in places like transportation but the cost for green hydrogen continue to look even as they're dropping look relatively high compared to conventional gas for example and I'm just period at a high level sort of the rough time frame over which you think green hydrogen may be viable for the utility business? Jeff Martin : Well, it's a good question. I will start by telling you I don't have a perfect view of what the right answer is. I think the analogy that we've talked about on our senior team is photovoltaics. So photovoltaics have been pursued by our interest industry going back to the 1960s and it was that Sempra that we launched the first large-scale central station project in 2008, Stephen you may recall that was the copper melting project. It was 10 megawatts. So that was 2008 and today it's not uncommon to see a 500 megawatt project that's really, really price competitive and very much more price competitive than traditional fossil fire generation. So if we think about hydrogen we see a similar opportunity. It clearly is early on the green hydrogen side. At best it's the second half of this coming decade but a lot will determine on the cost curve and how much advances are made on the R&D side. I think given that uncertainty it's important that not just Sempra but a lot of other companies spend time and resources here because I think we have the chance to impact that cost curve and impact the commercial viability of green hydrogen and particularly when you think about California where we have periods of the year where we're long renewable resources and they cannot be used and you're actually trying to export them or pay contiguous states like Arizona take that power, we have a real inefficiency certain times of the year and that production profile overlays very nicely with green hydrogen. So look I think if there is going to be a breakthrough and there is going to be any development that moves it forward in time California is the place where it will happen. Stephen Byrd : Well, that makes a lot of sense and then just thinking about natural gas usage in the state and obviously California is doing some thinking around moving away from conventional natural gas. Do you have a sense of sort of the regulatory or other timelines or sort of milestones or other sort of proceedings that we should be at least thinking about as we look at that or is there really nothing definitive it's just sort of a longer-term aspiration within the state? Jeff Martin : Yes. But there is a two-part process being read by the PUC today. There is a phase 1 review of the appropriate policies and impacts on natural gas that will lead to a phase 2 program both SDG&E and SoCalGas are active in those proceedings but I think when you speak with a lot of consultants in the space a lot of political leadership but there's a recognition that natural gas will play a long-term role in the United States energy policy and a long-term role in California's energy policy. Remember as a decoupled state Stephen, it's probably more than reasonable that the natural gas could decline in some areas maybe in our core customers but with electrification it's more likely than not that you're going to need to number one produce two or three or four times electricity that we currently produce and that's going to require more natural gas for power production. So I think what you should expect to see is because we're decoupled our interests are aligned with policymakers to make sure we're pursuing low-cost, low-carbon strategies but electrification is a big deal both in the United States and in California and natural gas particularly in power production will more than likely increase rather than decrease. I think it's important to your point to make sure we get the long-term policy right and that's why both of these proceedings at the PUC are very important and we'll be involved in it. Kevin would like to add some comments to that? Kevin Sagara : The only thing I may add is around R&G renewable natural gas. The gas companies set some pretty aggressive goals for itself 5% by 2022 and 20% by 2030 and they're really making good progress on those goals. In terms of getting projects online to capture that methane is really a really bad for the climate and so capturing it is an important part of the state's goals to mitigate GHG emissions and do something about climate change. So we're excited about R&G and what we you spoke about a regulatory construct that could be helpful and that would be around an RPS for R&G. So if we could have some kind of RPS standard in the state around R&G I'll be very supportive to more projects capturing them, so I'll start to run it back over to you Jeff. Jeff Martin : I think those are all good points. I'll probably just conclude with the fact that just seven months ago we got maybe one of the best general rate cases we've ever gotten at SoCalGas. So they're very much privileged in system reliability and safety. They've got a 9 plus percent CAGR of capital deployment inside their rate base. So it's a pretty aggressive program they have going on. In fact, across all three of our utilities when you think about our capital program we have average rate based growth forecasting for the next five years of 9%. Stephen Byrd : It's all really helpful color. Thank you very much. Jeff Martin : Appreciate it. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys thank you for taking my question and congrats on a good first half of the year. I really have two questions. One Jeff, you talked about the stock and talked about the valuation and how you trade relative to peers but just curious do you think structurally California utilities and you still have significant presence there? Obviously it's a bigger business, structurally a lower multiple business relative to regulated companies in other states? Jeff Martin : Let me just make sure I understand your question Michael and by the way thank you for joining our call. I think your question is when we think about Sempra's valuation how much should it be impacted by structural issues in California is that what you are asking? Michael Lapides : Yes. Do you believe that inherently the market views California utilities as a lower multiple business relative to utilities in other states? Jeff Martin : Yes. My initial instinct is no but let me give you a little bit of color. Going back to the end of 2017, 80% of our earnings composition came from California. When we project out our earnings growth through 2022 roughly 50% of our earnings competition comes to California and I think what makes me feel good about the California story Michael is if you look at the remedial measures that we're taking to make sure that we're not exposed to wildfire risk financially particularly if you're prudent that's really important. I think I would govern my view of it Mike by the quality of the rate case we got. And you've heard us talk about this before but you got a remarkable rate case for SDG&E and SoCalGas. You also have a really high quality cost of capital. SDG&E's average cost of capital when you blend in the first cost of capital is about 10.4% and then you've got this kind of runway now for really a five-year deployment of your revenue requirement which we never have before. So as long as I've been around the business I've never been able to have that clear of a runway for what our authorized spending level is. So I go back to the cost of capital, the rate case, the remedial measures to make sure that we've mitigated risk in the environment and overall one thing I think that people miss sometimes Michael and we've been kind of jealous about it here at our company is, the key for utilities is to make sure you're in markets that have a lot of economic expansion, population growth and great regulation and when you measure those three categories California still looks like a premium market as does Texas. So we're pleased to have kind of a tier 1 position here in a tier 1 position in Texas is that underlying economic growth not just capital deployed for safety or reliability it gives you this long-term opportunity to deploy capital. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you for that Jeff. Just curious on the LNG front and I'm really thinking just about Cameron 1, 2, 3 can you remind us in the next five years or so or the next three to five years how much cash, I know you talk about how much you're going to get out of the life of the project but just next three to five years how much cash you think you get or how should we think about the annual run rate of cash coming out of Cameron 1, 2, 3? Jeff Martin : Right. So what we've said publicly in the past now I'll review it with you is we've talked about having just from Cameron itself a $400 million to $450 million a year run rate I think in our latest estimates Michael, I might revise that to be a little bit higher we have some more work to be done on that. We think we have much more clear vision to the runway for it going forward. I think that over the next couple years 2021 it goes up quite significantly it's closer to 650 million and then it has a steady state around 450 to 475. So over the life of the project it's going to be greater than $12 billion of cash after debt service. On a run rate basis it's going to be closer to the high end of that 400 to 450 and the next year just because of how some of the amortization schedules work you're going to have a little higher cash back to the company in 2021. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jeff. Much appreciate. I'll follow up with your team offline. Jeff Martin : I appreciate it Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine :  Hi, based on the current business outlook and recent 2020 guidance revision, is there any color you're able to share about the current outlook for 2021 guidance and drivers within the range? Jeff Martin : Well, I think one of the things I go back to Ryan was you may recall we were all together virtually in our investor day. We talked about the A system we have to prioritize our activities really around trying to deliver our financial goals and I think if you think about 2019. we set forward an EPS guidance range and during the year we got into the high end of the range and we were very pleased Ryan that we were able to exceed that range on our February calls when we announced our Q4 results. This year you'll call we set a guidance range for 2020 and we've been able to guide higher in that range on the May call and then on June 30s we guided and actually adjusted our range actually raised in the low end of our range by $0.50. So as we think about 2021 I think we're pleased today Ryan to affirm our guidance for 2021 we have some more work to be done here but we have an evergreen planning process. It goes on constantly and I think that what Alan characterize for 2021 is we're on our front foot. You're going to have positive uplift from Cameron moving to full run rate. You're going to have the earnings from South America will get backed out for 2021. We feel good about it we just have more work to be done and if we get through that work it seems like we should adjust the 2021 number we will I think our pattern in practice Ryan has been to under promise and then work really, really hard to exceed expectations. Ryan Levine : Thank you and then what was the average price that the $500 million buyback was purchased at and was this previewed with the rating agencies and then going forward what credit parameters or guide posts are you looking at when deciding on share buyback amounts and potential timing in future years? Jeff Martin : Yes. I'll start with the credit metrics and I'll pass it to Trevor talk about the weighted average share repurchase price but we've been pretty consistent our credit metrics during our slide presentation today. We remain on track to meet those by the end of the year and those have been commitments we've made over multiple years. So we don't see any change to the credit metrics but perhaps Trevor you could speak to the repurchase program. Trevor Mihalik : Sure Jeff. So Ryan what we did is we had an ASR, the accelerated stock repurchase program for the last 30 days and the weighted average price of that was 122. Ryan Levine : Great. Thank you. And just like it's one mixed in terms of rating preview, rating key preview is that done in advance or not? Jeff Martin : Ryan repeat the question again please. Ryan Levine : Was this previewed with the rating agencies? Trevor Mihalik : Yes. We have talked to the rating agencies about this recently as to what our overall plan is and where we're anticipating to get to by the end of the year. Jeff Martin : And the best way I would comment on that Ryan, if you want to kind of a short form approach is that we've laid out a capital program in that capital program we were able to move some capital out this year into future years that was a $500 million shift in our capital deployment and what we really did was redeploy that capital right into buying our shares at what we think is a very attractive price. Ryan Levine : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Good morning Jeff, hope all is well you and your family. Just a quick question if I go back to the potential for the $2 billion share repurchase authorization, can I think of that as a placeholder for LNG. I know you spoke about the strength of your LNG model but if that gets pushed out further maybe because of the total impact of COVID could you think about the $2 billion share repurchased as a placeholder for that? Jeff Martin : Anthony, it's actually a very interesting question. I would probably frame it by saying that the last authorization that we are working on with our board was put in place in 2007. It really gave management the opportunity to look for points in time where we thought the stock was undervalued. I think we're certainly one of those points of time today I mean we're very, very bullish on how attractively our stock is priced today. I don't know that I would associate it directly with LNG but I think the way we've described our capital allocation process this year where we fund our first order priorities particularly around our utilities we make a commitment to pay down parent debt and deliver our credit metrics to the rating agencies. If there's opportunities either from a sale or divestiture of an asset or cash flow from other parts of our business or deferrals of CapEx we will always be looking for opportunities periodically to be opportunistic to support our stock. Anthony Crowdell : Thanks so much. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff Martin : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : We'll you our next question from Eric [indiscernible] with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys this is [indiscernible] on for Eric. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll keep it quick over the other hour mark but on Mexico you guys highlighted some of the sort of near-term noise that might be impacting the public share price at this point. I just thought it would be good to get some commentary I know a lot of people on this call sit on the board for -- about how Sempra sort of represents interests and what kind of strategic levers are available to de-risk the mistake whether that be the interplay between payout ratio and credit metrics and things like that just generally sort of what the strategic direction for looks like? Jeff Martin : Sure. I would say that we have 11 members on the board on IEnova six come from Sempra plus Carlos, [indiscernible] and Tanya we are very active in terms of how they build their capital program, how they manage their balance sheet. Certainly when you think about that business it's very rare in Mexico to see a business of this scale with U.S. dollar denominated revenues and when you think about the tenor of that portfolio they've really been able to assemble a very, very attractive basket of assets and remember our long-term goal is we don't want to invest outside of our utilities unless we think that we can risk adjust those cash flows to match the expectations from a risk reward standpoint of our U.S. based utility. So the one development that's taking place down there that kind of goes to the issue you're speaking that is over time we now have the majority of our revenues coming from non-government entities and I think we see that trend continuing over time and I think there will be periods in our investments in Mexico where we slow our capital spending. We preserve asset value and we leverage the value of our dividend for purposes of our shareholders but the long-term story is intact and maybe Faisel I know you're on the board of directors and maybe you can provide some thought in terms of how they manage the balance sheet and expectations in terms of creating value in Mexico. Faisel Khan : I think that in the current environment we're going to be very disciplined in terms of how we allocate capital in Mexico and that's through either deferring capital continuing to look at the dividend and continue to buy back stocks in Mexico; those are three of the biggest levers that we have in order to create value in Mexico and so the board is very focused on discipline in the current environment. Clearly ECA is a great opportunity for us to create a lot of shareholder value and that's what the focus is going to be going forward. So I think it's pretty straightforward from the way we look at it at the board level. There is the opportunity in LNG and then there is the ability to be disciplined in how we allocate capital to the rest of the business and to shareholders. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. That's awesome just on the scenario permitting process can you just give an update on where that stands and sort of what the remaining, the bureaucratic angles might be? Jeff Martin : This is Jeff. I would just make a couple comments. Number one is it's a novel request. So traditionally state-owned enterprises had the domain and responsibility for the export of hydrocarbons. This would be the first permit that they've issued that authorizes the export of hydrocarbons by private entity; number one. Number two, the government has largely been shut down because of the pandemic. I think Mexico today ranks number three in the world in terms of impacts from the virus in deaths. So they've been going through a really difficult situation economically and that's impacted obviously the function of the government but I would say this and I've mentioned it several times, I think that all the things that you expect us to be doing as a company both at Sempra and at IEnova in terms of relationships and value proposition and following up with folks we're doing that. I wish we could have delivered the snare permit in Q4 of last year. This thing has gone on a little bit further than you would probably think reasonable but look there is been a lot of extenuating circumstances. The conversations remain quite positive and I'm optimistic that we'll get to permit later in Q3. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks guys. Jeff Martin : Appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Hello, good morning. How are you doing? Jeff Martin : Hey Paul. Paul Patterson : All my questions have been answered. Just really just back to the franchise agreement in San Diego what's a little unusual, I guess is this idea of having a competition, so to speak and I'm just what's unclear to me because you guys own all these facilities there and everything what would happen if in fact the franchise was actually awarded to another party? What would be the process from there if you follow what I'm saying? As you mentioned you're negotiating around the state and I've obviously seen them around in other places but I've never seen a situation where there is an actual competitive bid so to speak for the franchising. What would it mean if it was actually awarded to somebody else? Jeff Martin : I would probably say Paul, the most probable answer is the simplest answer which is in this case the franchise in the city charter requires a competition. It requires they go out and compete to. So I don't know how this is done in other jurisdictions but in San Diego this is a requirement in the city charge. This is not like an anomaly that they're doing something outside of what they're required to do and our approach really is to make sure that we as I indicated earlier we approached this with a dose of humility we put forward a really-really attractive partnership campaign. I think you can look at other jurisdictions I think board of Colorado as an example many big things turn into very extended long-term contests. We don't think that's desirable for anyone and I think what we want to do is use this Paul as an opportunity for our company to get better and reassess our strengths and make sure we put forward commitment that we can stand behind. We can take a century-old relationship and make it better. Paul Patterson : Okay but just to sort of understand there would be a completely different process if there was the franchise award to somebody else that would, it wouldn't be surprising if that resulted in a lot of litigation and cost etc. If I understand that correctly? Is that a way to think about it? Jeff Martin : I don't know if I would characterize it as litigation. I can tell you that our focus and attention is on controlling what we can control which is we want to put forward the best most compelling value propositions in the city. These are our neighbors. This is a place we care about a lot. So we're going to play to win Paul and I think that's the 100% focus of our attention. Paul Patterson : Okay. Thanks so much and have a good day. Jeff Martin : I appreciate it. Thank you for joining the call. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Jeff Martin for closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nelly Molina. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Nelly Molina : Good morning. And welcome to Sempra Energy\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section. Several members of our management team are on the line with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra LNG; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Kevin Sagara, Group President; and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. All the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. I\u2019d also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 5, 2020 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks, Nelly, and thank you all for joining us today. Before I start, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the exceptional work of our 18,000 employees who have been working hard to improve the safety and resilience of the communities we serve. We power thousands of hospitals and emergency service providers, the nation's two largest ports hundreds of clean transit and heavy-duty trucking fleets and essential electric generation. Millions of people count on our critical energy infrastructure and the work we do is a great credit to the dedication and professionalism of all our employees. Last quarter we successfully concluded a two-year capital rotation program where we divested noncore assets and repositioned our business and what we believe are the best markets in North America and we continue to see steady improvements in our financial results. Today we're proud to be reporting strong earnings and reaffirming and guiding to the high end of our full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range. Additionally we're reaffirming, our full year 2021 EPS guidance range. Now please turn to the next slide. In addition to improving financial performance, our current strategy of focusing on lower risk T&D investments as the added benefit of producing stable cash flows and improved earnings visibility. In large measure this is a result of strong growth that we're seeing in our California and Texas Utilities where constructive regulation limits exposure to the price and volume of electricity and/or natural gas sold. Also when taken together, our U.S. utilities have a blended authorized ROE of right around 10.1%, which is excellent given the current environment. Adding to the growth profile of our utilities, our North American infrastructure businesses also provide attractive economic returns and are supported our take-or-pay contracts with over 20-year terms on average. As we've demonstrated in Peru and Chile, as well as our renewables business we built strong franchises that competed locally and globally. When we sold those businesses, investors not only bought the assets but also the franchise value we had built up over decades, which was reflected in the premium multiple that we received. Similarly we think we've built a strong franchise in our LNG business and to fund its growth needs, we're focused on sourcing the lowest cost of capital to enhance value to our shareholders. At Cameron LNG we believe cash flows from phase one should cover any required equity for the phase two expansion. Separately at Port Arthur LNG, we're evaluating efficient financing options with a view towards shifting post-FID equity contributions until much later in the construction phase. And at ECA LNG phase one, we estimate that Sempra and IEnova's equity funding to be approximately $250 million for each company. That's why with all this growth in front of us, we're actively looking at different financing structures and different forms of infrastructure and strategic capital. In doing so we think it gives us the opportunity to efficiently fund growth, to highlight the growing value of our LNG franchise and to strengthen Sempra's balance sheet, which is important since we expect to also increase our investments in our utility businesses over the next five years. Beyond highlighting our continued execution and the strong organic growth from our infrastructure platforms, I would also like to update you on the recent recognitions we've received in the area of diversity and inclusion, which I would note is central to how we think about a high performing culture. Please turn now to the next slide. In the last month, we received two awards recognized in Sempra for its industry-leading approach to diversity inclusion. The first was the National Association of Corporate Directors -- NXT award, which recognizes company boards for their excellence in utilizing diversity and inclusion as a strategy for building long-term value for their companies. And the second was the Forbes JUST 100 list, which recognizes companies are doing right by all of their stakeholders. We're proud of the results of our continued focus around people priorities and culture across our management and more broadly our workforce we compare favorably to industry benchmarks and the representation of both women and people of color. We also have a strong record and commitment to supplier diversity. And I think, the key takeaway is we're focused on advancing our strategy in a way that is increasingly responsive to all stakeholders over time. Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll highlight some of our more notable accomplishments for the year. This slide shows why I couldn't be more proud of our team. I won't discuss everything that's referenced here, but several points are particularly noteworthy. This year we launched a record five-year capital plan completed the sale of both our Peruvian and Chilean businesses with cash proceeds of approximately $5.8 billion before tax. Guided to the high end of our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range in May and then raise guidance in June, and now we're guiding to the high end of that increased range. And lastly, we executed a $500 million share buyback. Before turning to the next slide, I wanted to briefly discuss the San Diego franchise agreement. The city charter here in San Diego requires a competitive process to renew the franchise with a view towards getting the best outcome for the residents of the city. And those same residents happen to be our customers as well. So we have a strong alignment of interest here with this city to ensure a great outcome. SDG&E recently submitted a competitive bid and looks forward to concluding the process later this year. But because we are in a quiet period we need to be respectful of the city's process and accordingly, we'll not be able to comment further. Please turn now to the next slide, and I'll turn the call over to Trevor to review some of the more notable operational and financial developments. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. We had several positive developments this past quarter at all of our infrastructure businesses. SDG&E launched a comprehensive sustainability strategy to advance carbon neutrality. This strategy focuses on aspirational goals in environmental stewardship, clean transportation, grid modernization and community engagement, all designed to directly support California's clean energy goals. As part of its sustainability commitment, SDG&E announced its plans to place two green hydrogen projects into service by 2022. While these projects are small in relation to our capital plan, we view them as important steps towards a cleaner energy economy and are an acknowledgment that we have an important role to play. At SoCalGas, we announced that the U.S. Department of Energy awarded funding for three projects advancing clean automotive transportation technologies that we're participating in, including fuel cell technology for trucking and transit and near zero emissions natural gas technology for rail locomotives. This is another demonstration of our commitment to be an integral part of California's clean energy future. In addition, the California utilities received a final decision from the CPUC for approval to recover approximately $935 million related to the pipeline safety enhancement plan. This represents approval for virtually all of the amounts requested in the proceeding. Moving to Texas. Today Oncore announced its 2021 to 2025 capital plan of $12.2 billion. This is an increase over the previous five-year capital plan and is a testament to continued execution by the Oncor team, growth in its service territory and resiliency of its business. Additionally, Oncor issued its inaugural sustainable bonds with proceeds to finance or refinance expenditures with minority and women-owned businesses. Now let's shift to our North American infrastructure businesses. We're pleased that Cameron LNG phase 1 reached full commercial operations in August. All three trains are now generating earnings and cash flows. As a reminder, we expect our share of annual earnings to be approximately $400 million to $450 million with no commodity or volume and our exposure and the contracts are supported by A-rated customers who are also equity partners in the facility.  Additionally, due to the structure of the tolling agreements, Sempra doesn't expect an earnings impact from the recent outages due to Hurricanes Laura and Delta. We continue to work with our partners to ensure the resiliency of the operations. Moving to ECA LNG phase 1. We're continuing to work closely with the local authorities as well as at the highest levels of the Mexican government to advance the export permit process. We're expecting to reach a final investment decision by year-end.  As a reminder ECA LNG phase 1 is fully contracted with long-term take-or-pay contracts. SPAs with Total and Mitsui are each in place for a 20-year term and we have a lump-sum turnkey EPC contract with TechnipFMC.  Shifting to Mexico. We've advanced construction of the Gulf of Mexico fuel terminal network. Once completed, the three strategic terminals which are all backed by dollar-denominated take-or-pay contracts with Valero should contribute nearly 3.4 million barrels of combined refined product storage capacity while improving Mexico's energy security. Notably, the Veracruz terminal is situated in the largest Mexican ports on the Gulf Coast and is expected to be one of the largest terminals in the country. Please turn to slide 9 where I will discuss more detail about Oncor's capital plan. Texas continues to be one of the premium macro and business environments in the United States and Oncor is well-positioned to take advantage of these strong fundamentals. This is demonstrated by an increase in Oncor's five-year capital plan to $12.2 billion projected for 2021 through 2025, which is primarily attributable to supporting new growth across both the transmission and distribution systems, maintaining the transmission system including investments to enhance the safety and reliability of service and continuing investments in innovation and technology.  Overall Oncor's five-year capital plan has increased by over 60% since the 2017 regulatory commitment reflecting the continued growth and critical investments needed to support its customers, the state and the ERCOT market. Please turn to slide 10 where I'll review our financial results. Early this morning, we reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $351 million or $1.21 per share. This compares to third quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $813 million or $2.84 per share. On an adjusted basis third quarter 2020 earnings were $380 million or $1.31 per share. This compares to third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of $425 million or $1.50 per share. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following key items : $56 million of lower earnings due to the sales of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020 respectively; $32 million of lower income tax benefits from flow-through items due to the timing of the 2019 GRC final decision at SoCalGas; $32 million of unfavorable impacts from foreign currency and inflation effects at Sempra Mexico net of foreign currency derivatives.  Third quarter 2019 had approximately a $10 million gain and third quarter 2020 had approximately a $20 million loss. $29 million charge related to an energy efficiency program inquiry at SDG&E $3 million of lower earnings at Sempra Texas utilities, including $21 million from unfavorable weather.  The lower earnings were also due to increased operating costs partially offset by increased revenues from rate updates to reflect invested capital. This was partially offset by $79 million of higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase 1 commencing commercial operations and $21 million impairment of non-utility native gas assets at SoCalGas in 2019. Please turn to the final slide. We're pleased to report a successful quarter both operationally and financially. Benefiting from a more narrowed strategic focus, we're reaffirming and guiding to the high end of our full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range and reaffirming our full year 2021 EPS guidance range. We remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value, and I could not be more pleased with our overall year-to-date financial performance even in these challenging market conditions. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. And we'll stop to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Just a couple of questions here, Jeff. Can we just first \u2013 can we touch on some of the moving pieces on sort of the 2021 earnings drivers as you're thinking about it? Especially, as it sort of sets up to be a cleaner year from a business mix perspective, I guess, how do you think about year-over-year growth from your prior revised higher 2020 EPS guidance range, which now actually points to the top end. So what are some of the pushes and takes as you think about 2021 and build off the higher 2020 base? Jeff Martin : Well, I appreciate the question Shahriar. And I think, I would just start by saying that we feel great about the year we're having in 2021. And I think, I want to emphasize the fact when you think about what the market backdrop is, I think it's one of the toughest situations that any of us have gone through in terms of the COVID, and the impact to our economy. But as you think about 2021, you raised a great point, which is it will be a very clean year for us. It will be the first year you will not see contributions from any of our divested businesses. You recall that, we've divested roughly $30 billion in enterprise value of assets over the last two and half years. And I think the whole goal was to make sure that we improved our performance going forward. So as you look to 2021, I think you should continue to expect that the lead driver for our company will be our utilities, right? So you've got upwards of a $30 billion, five-year capital program dedicated to our regulated investments. You've got a blended ROE across that platform of about 10.1, which is differential in today's marketplace. And to a point that you alluded to next year will be the first year that you'll see full annual run rate earnings from Cameron, which we talked about being in that $400 million to $450 million range. But I do want to mention that, the goal of this whole capital recycling program Shahriar over the last two years was to put this management team in a position where we had a clear field of vision to do one thing, which was improve our financial performance. Now, I was thinking about it coming into this call but if you think back Shahriar to 2019, we began the year with a guidance range of $5.70 to $6.30. And then last year on the Q3 call, we raised the entire guidance range to $6.50 of EPS, and then we delivered the year with an actual earnings number adjusted of $6.78. And that really set us up quite well for 2020. We began this year with $6.70 to $7.50 guided to the high end of that range you may recall on the Q1 call. And then in June, just over a month later we raised the entire range to $7.20 to $7.80. And I think, I call this out on our last earnings call, which you may remember back when we used to provide five-year guidance. I went back and looked at 2016. In five years in advance, we had forecasted an adjusted EPS range of $7.20 to $7.80. So being able to deliver that performance in 2019 and 2020 and now be in a position to your point to guide to the high end of the range, we're going to exceed a 12% earnings CAGR over the last five years. So this idea that, we're going to be nimble we're going to keen to compete our capital and adjust our portfolio to deliver returns, I think has set us up really well for 2021. So I would just conclude on this point. We're optimistic about the returns we can produce next year. Shar Pourreza : Terrific. Terrific. And then just on ECA, I know clearly the gating factor for Phase 1 is the permits. Any sort of updates Jeff at this juncture? And is the perception out there that this process really now relies on a second proposed LNG project. Can you just maybe touch on that? And then what's your sort of stance or threshold in further Mexico investments? Jeff Martin : Yes, there's a couple of questions embedded there. But I'll start from the top and say that for the ECA project to go forward it is 100% disconnected from another project going forward. So, I think the most important development has caused us to have improved confidence is that we completed the successful consultation down in Baja over the last three weeks. We may have seen that we received a positive vote with strong local support around the 60% level. And what's most important is that sends a strong message to the central government where we've developed some great relationships. So, I think I have been wrong on this before I must confess. We originally thought that how we get this permit with the team in Q4 of last year. But I think what has been the big difference now has been the relationships we've developed and the consultation that occurred down in Baja. The goal here is to get the SENER permit which we're forecasting to get this month that's the authorization to export hydrocarbons off the coast of Mexico. And we also think it's reasonable Shahriar that we will have a final investment decision with the permit this quarter. Transitioning to the larger picture down in Mexico. I think you've heard us talk about this in the past where we're constructive I think over a longer term horizon. I think the short term we definitely envision some headwinds. There have been some dislocations in the market based upon some of the policies and protections around state-owned enterprises. And that's why you saw the IEnova team earlier this year adjust their plans. And namely they backed off on just over $200 million of capital for 2020 and that was designed to free up cash to support an opportunistic share repurchase program. They have bought back to date I believe roughly 77 million shares which has increased Sempra's ownership in that public company to the 70% level. And I think when you trace that through they put about $230 million to work in their share repurchase program. And their approach very similar to ours at Sempra is to be opportunistic when they think the market supports that. And then I think the final update I would say is I recently cut their dividend. So, they're doing all the things you expect them to do to preserve the value of the business and be opportunistic about positioning the business for more value. And the dividend cut is really designed to bolster liquidity and short the balance sheet. So, I would just say big picture the focus of Sempra LNG and the focus of the IEnova is really about getting the ECA project launch which is a very, very big project. It will be the largest construction project in the history of Baja California I think we're very well positioned to execute it. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then Jeff just one last one for me. A little bit more of a strategic question for you is Sempra is effectively one of the last sort of hybrid utilities will be with the scale of the infrastructure investments that you have. So, it's been a big theme this year by derisking about simplifying. So, I'm just kind of curious what are your thoughts on sort of the overall business mix, especially if your stock really never gets the value that it really does deserve when do you and the Board start to like maybe consider options and rethink the current strategy? Jeff Martin : Yes, I would say one of the things that's embedded in your question Shahriar is you should assume that we're doing that all the time. I think sometimes outside perception is that a Board of Directors or a management team will have a strategy session once a year. That's not the way it works with Sempra. And I think as a credit to our Board and our management team, you can't find another company in our space that's had the transactional activity we've had in the last 24 months. So, you think about transaction on enterprise value roughly $30 billion of transactions in two years. It's a pretty sweeping change to our portfolio. And you couple that with the earnings performance that we've demonstrated over the last two years we have something special going on the company in terms of a unique growth and income story. And I'm not here to tell you that the market gets it right every day. But I do believe in efficient markets over time we certainly think our stock is undervalued. And that's why you saw it be proactive this summer in terms of executing the share repurchase program. But I will tell you this we're not wedded to any single asset. So, if there's opportunities or dislocations in the marketplace you should expect us to look for them. And let me highlight one example for you that I referenced in my prepared remarks, when you think about the LNG space as a vertical category we have a pretty confident view that we've got a leading franchise in North America. It's well-capitalized. I think there's a series of built-in competitive advantages that allows us to access both the Asian market in a unique way as well as being able to dispatch directly into the Atlantic. And if you look Shahriar at the runway of growth in front of our LNG business, it's differential from any other company in North America. So in my prepared remarks, one of the things I highlighted is that, we're actively looking at ways that we can create more value of the portfolio and really compete, different sources of capital, so that we can fund growth. Our goal obviously is to source the lowest cost of capital to fund that growth, but I want to be very clear, where also Shahriar looking for ways to highlight value for our shareholders. And strengthen our balance sheet. So as I thought about, this call today, we went back and looked at some of the transaction values in the marketplace. And a lot of the research work around our business, we'll show people in the sum of the parts analysis looking at our LNG business at nine or 10 times EBITDA. But you look at some of the transactions and some of them are quite recent whether it's co-point Sempra Energy Partners is a variety of transactions where there's value being highlighted in the marketplace. And you're seeing those, chart go off at 12 times to 14 times. So, there's certainly a dislocation between the, value being attributed to our portfolio. And that's why I would say, that the bottom-line is, we think there's a lot of franchise value, in our LNG business. You saw that show up, in how we transacted around wind and solar. You saw that franchise value in the transaction multiples in Peru, in Chile which went off at 16 times and 17 times. So one of the things I can commit to you is, we're going to be active. And we're going to be active about driving value for our shareholders. I certainly agree with you that, we haven't seen that show up in our stock price. But we will not be standing still. Shar Pourreza : Terrific. That's very helpful, Jeff. And thank you Justin and Trevor. Hi guys. Jeff Martin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll now take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yes. So sorry I -- my question actually was related to that last question in the comments you made in your remarks about, looking at different financing structures and strategic capital for the LNG projects. And I guess my question there is, when you make that comment is it more for each individual project, as you're thinking about that, or is it for kind of the business as a whole? Jeff Martin : Right. Well let me start Steve by saying, we appreciate having the opportunity to participate in the conference over the last couple of weeks. I know I didn't participate on the day that the conference actually went off. It's always a conference, we look forward to. So, as we think about, the options we're looking at. And you can go back and review my prepared remarks we're active in both regards. We're looking at both, financing options and financing structures at the project level and at the portfolio level. And to be very specific, we're also looking at both, infrastructure and strategic capital. Steve Fleishman : Got it. That's helpful. And the -- I guess there's a balance between value and then, you're actually particularly on Cameron, good earnings out of the business. So when you think about, kind of, value creation, how are you just thinking about that aspect, in terms of -- I guess, really making some things may be accretive or not, or how are you thinking about that? Jeff Martin : I think you can go back. And look at our track record. As we look at, things that we divest and things that we invest in, we always do it through the lens of accretion. I think the three comments I've made, I think twice now on this call, is we're looking to source lowest cost of capital to fund growth. We're looking to highlight value. And certainly we feel quite constructive about looking at things which are only accretive. But I also think that in doing so, this is not just an academic exercise. I think that our partners particularly in the, LNG space really think that one of the things that's unique about our LNG story is the strength of financial commitment behind that business. And particularly in this marketplace, I think it has really allowed us to have a more competitive position, particularly relative to our peers here in North America. So, I would just say it's about funding growth efficiently. It's about highlighting value and accretion. And it's about supporting our balance sheet. Steve Fleishman : Got it. That's helpful. I\u2019ll let others ask question. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thanks for joining Steve. Operator : Thank you. We'll have next from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Hi. So perhaps just to pick up, Steve. This is the game [ph]. Just to be very clear about your thoughts on, buybacks, right? So obviously you did some early this summer. Perhaps less so this quarter, how are you thinking about capital allocation in the nearer term sense here? I mean, obviously, think you're fairly clear last quarter. So I just want to make sure we're hearing you right as to how you're thinking about some of the nearer term priorities for capital? Jeff Martin : Well, I think if you go back to the early part of the year, we announced what was our largest ever five-year capital program of just over $30 billion to $32 billion of capital over five years. And that's completely geared towards supporting the growth in our regulated business. As you heard Allen talk about, or at least we talked about with Allen in our script. The growth we're seeing at Oncor and he's always got another $750 million of capital outside of that plan that they've circled in their tracking, which could also increase. So our job is to continue to find ways to produce what we think is the differential growth and income story. We're going to support our dividend. We're going to manage our balance sheet and we're going to fund the growth that's right in front of us. If there's times where we see a dislocation in the marketplace Julien like you and I have talked about before, we will always look for opportunities to be opportunistic around the share repurchase program. I think you've seen IEnova take that approach. Obviously you saw us do that earlier this summer. Having that dry powder with the $2 billion approval by our Board is very helpful. It's something we constantly look at and it's available to us. And it's going to be driven by where we think that we can produce the most value. So you saw a decline in our stock price, in the mid part of the summer and we were active there. But we're also going to meet the growth needs. So it's a balancing issue. It's something we look at a lot Julien. We don't take a firm view and now a \u201c$2 billion program\u201d. That authorization is there to let us do what we've done in the past, which is approach it opportunistically to create value. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Let me give an overview of what\u2019s happened, you all talked about upside potentials previously upwards of $1 billion. You raised I think I'm going to call it just $300 million of late. How do you think about feathering in further outside capital and Oncore in this $300 million relative to the larger numbers you guys have talked about as some of the potentials there earlier? Jeff Martin : Yes. So, obviously, we own right over 80% of Oncor. This is an investment that we think very highly of. So when you think about our commitment to invest in T&D assets or assets that have T&D level risk. One of the things that Allen outlined in our analyst conference was some incremental capital opportunities between right around $770 million to $1.17 billion of incremental capital. We think that a lot of that opportunity is still there that's outside of this $12.2 million. But I would just comment that we have a strong view about our ownership position in Oncor. We certainly do not see any need to bring in outside third-party capital to support that. In fact we'd love to own more of that business. But let me stop and bring Allen in and Allen perhaps you can talk about the current market environment and growth you're seeing on your system, which I think called as all of us to have more confidence about being able to better serve Texas customers. Allen Nye : You bet, Jeff. And thanks for the question Julien. First the incremental capital point just to reiterate, we're doing two things today. One, we've increased the five-year plan by $300 million. And then we're also adding another year right at the back end of the plan for 2025 another strong year at $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion. So we do feel good about growth and where the state is going where our company is going. As Jeff said the $12.2 million is separate and part of the incremental capital that we talked about before. So if you look back at my last analyst presentation as Jeff said, I think we had a slide around 775 to 1.275 in incremental capital opportunities above and beyond that. That is still available. That is not diminished by this increase today. And if we see -- we try to be conservative in our planning. But if we see growth, really strong growth continuing at levels that exceed what we're anticipating now if we get oil and gas returning to pre-COVID or beyond levels, or if we continue to see really strong growth in renewables I'll talk about in a second. Then we may be back with more at some point. But we feel very good about the $12.2 million over $5 million based on what we're seeing on our system now and our conservative planning approach. With regards to the growth that Jeff mentioned, when we talk about growth on our system there's several criteria we look at. One is obviously serve new. It's basically the number of new premises or a number of new meters on our system. Notwithstanding, all the challenges of 2020, we did around 64,000 and we added about 64,000 last year in 2019. We added 21,000 in the third quarter of this year and we're on track to be right on top of our 2019 number. So, notwithstanding economic downturn COVID and all the fun of 2020, we feel good about our new service coming in basically where it was last year. On the transmission side, we generally have two buckets, retail points of interconnection and generation points of interconnection. Retail is slightly down. However, generation interconnection requests are significantly up and far exceed the decrease on the retail side to the point, where we're anticipating, we'll have probably our highest level ever of total transmission POI requests that we have active at any given time. We have I think, about 275 in the queue right now. So, growth remains strong. We're still clicking along at about a 2% premise growth. Transmission POIs look good. And obviously, based on the move we made today on CapEx, we feel good about growth moving forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to spend some time on California. I guess, first just talking about the event all move away from methane. I know, you've been a thought leader in approaches there. I was just curious, in terms of your dialogue with regulators and legislators et cetera, just sort of generally the feedback you're getting and your sense of potential sort of concrete next steps or is this just a very long gradual process? How do you kind of see that unfolding? Jeff Martin : Yes. Thank you for the question. And I'll pull Kevin Sagara, our Group President for California into it momentary. There is a process underway at the PUC to look at a phased approach to how we integrate a natural gas strategy over multiple decades to help decarbonize the state. But I might start just with a little bit of a perspective, nationally. I think that, over the last several decades, Stephen, the United States has led the world in reducing energy-related emissions. The IEA came out with the study in February that showed that emissions globally were flat in 2019, but they -- of all the nations in the world, it was the United States that led the declines in 2019. So, we grew our economy at 2.3% and reduced our energy-related admissions by 3%. And in that study, what they indicated was, you saw declining emissions in OECD nations and increasing emissions in the developing world. And since the year 2000, we've led the world an absolute decline in emissions where currently one giga ton of carbon below the 2000 period here in the United States. And with the IEA credit, the massive build-out of renewables combined with support from natural gas and switching from coal to natural gas. So I think, it's a case study and is being viewed that way all around the world about the importance of getting LNG into developing markets, whether it's China or India or Malaysia or Vietnam or Thailand, they have the opportunity to build a lot of renewables and not back it was cold, but supported with natural gas. So, I think that thesis is still in over Stephen and how people are thinking about LDCs particularly in Europe. Today, LDCs have outperformed U.S. LDCs by 30%. And the narrative in Europe is there is a clear recognition that LDCs are a big part of the solution by taking exogenous methane in the form of renewable natural gas and putting that into the distribution system. And second, leading the world in not only producing hydrogen, but distribute it across transportation and industrial usage and power production. So, I think there's a thesis around methane that is really, really important that you can capture scaping emissions and you can be very proactive in terms of how you address environmental issues, but it is a core part of how we will support an energy transition globally. And I think, the blackouts from this summer have had a big sea change in the state in terms of how we think about the long-term role. But perhaps Kevin, you could talk about some of the things that are actively underway to support natural gases roll in California? Kevin Sagara : Thanks, Jeff. Yes. Let me tell you, why we're so excited about the gas company's leadership position and energy transition. My optimism really springs from a couple of areas. One, it's what we're doing now; and two, it's how we are aligned with energy policy in California. The gas company has an important role in the energy transition in California. Today, we have established a voluntary goal of having 5% of our core gas come from renewable natural gas by 2022 and 20% by 2030. Right now we're flowing 100% California produced renewable natural gas for all of our compressed natural gas refueling stations in our service territory. We will have reduced our fugitive methane emissions by 20% by 2015. This they have a goal to do that by 2025. So we're five years early in meeting the state mandate. We're also accelerating like Jeff talked about innovative technologies like renewable natural gas and hydrogen. And I'm really excited also about opportunities in carbon capture, our infrastructure to play a role there as well. Those are the things that we're doing. So now let's focus a little deeper on how we're aligned with the three legs of the energy policy stool in California. Those legs are clean energy safety and reliability and affordability. In the area of clean, undoubtedly we need and we'll see increasing penetration of renewable energy and electrification in this state. However, natural gas is a fundamental component of getting higher penetration of renewable resources on the grid. Batteries are expensive, we can't provide the long duration of storage, we need at times. During certain periods in the summer with 80% of our power was coming from gas and a little bit from coal. In August, like Jeff mentioned, there were blackout. And when the sun went down, I remember one day, you got about a system peak in California about maybe 50 or 60 gigawatts. And 29 gigawatts were coming at that point when the sun went down from gas we were getting one gigawatt from batteries. And so that was a real warning shot for the state that gas infrastructure is important. And really gas infrastructure enables more renewable energy. When you think about it, you want to get more renewables on, you got to have more back up and that comes mainly in the form of gas. In the area of safety and reliability, again gas backs of renewables for the reliable grid and in safety, it's obviously our number one priority. And that emphasis has been reflected in our most recent rate case, our PSEP decision that Trevor mentioned in his opening remarks. The CPUC is providing us the capital necessary to keep the gas system safe and reliable thus aligning with the state's priorities of a safe and reliable energy system. And lastly, the gas system is an affordable second energy system for our customers. The average natural gas bill is something around $40 a month and stakeholders in California recognize the increasing importance of on affordability as we execute this transition. So super excited about this energy transition you can watch on we're going to be leading at SoCalGas in this area. Jeff Martin : The only other thing I would add Stephen too is that, if you look at natural gas penetration rates, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere in the country, where you have a 90% penetration rate like you see in Southern California with one of the largest population centers in the country. So look, we're going to be thoughtful. We're going to partner with the governor. We've made a commitment to do that. I think there's a growing recognition that there's a transition here. And natural gas is part of the answer to help us get higher renewable penetration rates. And I think Kevin made that point, there's an efficient frontier and California is setting the record in the world for renewable penetration on electric system. Stephen Byrd : That's really a thorough answer. Maybe just one follow-up on an element there. Just following up on the blackout that we saw this summer. I saw the root cause assessment that came out. You mentioned this in your response to my first question. Just curious, how is the states sort of thinking through mean that's kind of \u2013 it's a sign. I mean the state has a long way to go still to add more renewables. So for having blackouts at this stage. I think that's kind of a warning sign in terms of just some changes that need to be made. How is that dialogue sort of playing out? And what might come out of sort of that root cause assessment and desire to make sure you don't have further blackouts in the future? Jeff Martin : Yes. Thank you for the question. I think that you have a lot of people that take a lot of pride in California about being a leader around the clean energy transition. This is something that the state cares a lot about all the utilities up and down the state are committed to supporting it. But when you think back about how challenged our system was you build the system in all your integrated resource plan in around a one in 10-year event. People are concluding that maybe it was a one in 30 event or one in 35 event. There's a couple of things that were uncovered, which I think they're really taking to heart in California. The first of which is, the imports in the state routinely run between 20% and 30%. So what happened during this southwest weather event was, a lot of the generation in Nevada and Arizona that we would otherwise rely on, which is all-natural gas and coal particularly at certain times during the day, was not available because it was being used in those states for cooling and air conditioning. Secondly, when you look at our state, you may have been late in the afternoon where you're getting a lot of solar contributions, but there wasn't sufficient ability to basically load follow. So, you've got really two issues here. One is California's energy and secure. We rely too much on imports and we need to build more generation in the state so that we're not reliant and dependent on other states. And number two, when you have a one in 30 event like that it causes you to go back and look at how you do your integrated resource planning to support your reserve margin. So typically this data has looked at between a 15% and 17% required reserve margin by utility as you procure your resources. And that has an implied value of signs of solar with resource adequacy and implied value to win. All those assessments have to be revisited to make sure that we have a larger more reliable reserve margin. So, I think the outcome from this will be the existing natural gas plants will be repowered. The state needs more peaking natural gas generation. You will see more electric storage put on in the state, and you need to see a lot more capacity built in the state of California. So there will be a process that takes place between the three energy agencies, the California Energy Commission, the California independent system operator in the CPUC, it's about being less reliant on third-party states. It's about revisiting our one in 10-year analysis and making sure that we revisit the capacity value that we allocate to planning around solar and wind. Stephen Byrd : .: Jeff Martin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Just wanted to circle back to Oncore for a minute if I could with the capital plan, and if you could talk a little bit more on the specific customer growth you're assuming under your updated plan here? And does this kind of bake in kind of the current trajectory in West Texas as it is? And I guess trying to feel out what type of sensitivity, what type of upside is possible if the commodity price environment does improve there? Jeff Martin : Yeah. Let me make a couple of comments. And Allen, you can feel in behind me. But I just want to recharacterize, when people think about West Texas, they think about the Permian and the Delaware Basin, it's really important to understand that what producers are trying to do right now is lower their marginal cost of production. And there is a huge benefit to be able to attach to the grid instead of self generating. So a lot of what the capital that's being deployed by Allen right now in West Texas is largely been approved and locked in for the next two years. And there's still a lot of demand for more infrastructure in that region because it's viewed as making their production more competitive. And then secondly, we usually circle something around 70,000 new meter additions a year. Allen can update on that. But I just think going through this pandemic and going through the disruption we've seen, Texas today has roughly an 8% unemployment rate against something here in California, which is closer to 12%. We think that Texas will be a big part of our nation's economic recovery and we think Oncor is as well positioned as any company to benefit from what we're forecasting in Texas. But perhaps Allen, you could provide some color behind my comments. Allen Nye : Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. And Jeremy the direct answer to your question as to what's in our kind of plan with regards to customer growth is for the last few years, we've seen 2% premise growth, which is around that number of premises that Jeff spoke about a minute ago. And that's what we have currently in this 12.2 five-year plan we're assuming 2% -- continued 2% premise growth. So when you think about things that could lead to increased investment. If we were to get things -- like I said before, if we could get residential or rather premise growth in excess of what's been planned or another example, which I gave earlier was, things returning to normal or better than normal in the oil field. That's a couple of examples. Obviously, a quicker or more aggressive implementation of renewable power. Texas already leads the nation in renewable power, but there is currently more than 100,000 megawatts of renewable, be it solar, wind or storage, in the queue at ERCOT to the extent that that manifested a little higher than a historical average of 30% or 40%. Those things would all be drivers that could ultimately end up increasing our CapEx. When you look at West Texas particularly, we're actually seeing some pretty good signs in West Texas, a couple that -- frankly were counterintuitive to me, just based on the fact that I know a lot of our customers out there have been significantly impacted. But if you look at ERCOT data, month-over-month demand in the Far West Texas region is actually up every month in 2020 versus the corresponding month in 2019. So demand in the Far West Texas region for every month in 2020 is in excess of 2019 month-over-month. So that's one. Two, Delaware Basin, we serve the portion of the Delaware Basin that we do on what's called the Culberson Loop, which is a transmission loop system that we have out there. The 2019 peak on that system was 550 megawatts. On September 25 of this year, we saw a peak of 678 megawatts. So while we're undoubtedly seeing impact to our customers in the West Texas region, we're seeing some really positive trends with regards to consumption. So there\u2019s hopefully light at the end of the tunnel there. But if West Texas -- if oil and gas activity returns to pre-COVID levels or there above, or if we see some of these other positives from generation or customer growth, those are generally the kinds of things. There are certainly more -- those are the kinds of things that would drive increased capital allocation. Jeremy Tonet : I think, Allen or likely Jeff. One of the things we've talked about that you might want to share is, we had a really major legislative development last year with act of 1938. And maybe talk about the overlay of that on top of the market description you just gave. Allen Nye : Yes, I'd be glad to Jeff. So just to refresh you all, 1938 which was passed out the legislature last year and signed into law effectively put into PURA, the current construct in ERCOT, which allocates transmission projects based on ownership of endpoint, substations more or less. And so, when you think about generation development, when you think about transmission point of interconnections, when you think about adjusting the grid as we shift to more renewables and the impacts you have when you reallocate the flows around the system, to the extent those require transmission upgrades or additional greenfield transmission projects, those projects would be allocated to the owner of the endpoints based on the 1938 now allocate -- are now rather codified into PURA law. We own more than 1,100, probably closer to 1,200 of those endpoints substations. So we believe we're fairly uniquely situated to capture a significant part of that growth. Thanks, Jeff Jeff Martin : Thank you, Allen. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for that. And then maybe kind of pivoting here and recognizing that this dynamic impact appears far more than you, but how are you finding the insurance market in California, specifically for wildfire insurance here? And does your risk profile of your system relative to tiers benefit your ability to secure cost-effective coverage? And do you anticipate any changes here given the record prior season? Jeff Martin : Thank you for the question. I'll go back and talk about our original thesis where we're trying to build a portfolio. It's really focused on T&D investments or investments at T&D-like risk. When you bring that into California, we certainly have received a differential approach by the insurance companies in terms of how they think about our risk relative to our peers. I'll pass it over to Trevor to provide a little bit more color about our insurance program. Trevor Mihalik : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. So, Jeremy, we have not had a problem procuring insurance and we've got a separate wildfire tower of over $1 billion. And we're getting it at very competitive rates. And in fact, we were also able to put out cat bonds this year at under 10%. So from our perspective, given all the technology and what SDG&E has done to fire harden the system and around the fire sciences, we are recognized differentially within the insurance markets. And procuring insurance at competitive rates is something that we're able to do fairly efficiently and effectively. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. I\u2019ll stop there and leave questions for others. Jeff Martin : Appreciate it. Operator : Okay. We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on progress during what's been a crazy year. Jeff, in your remarks at beginning you hit a specific detail to reference potential financing options for both Cameron 436 and Port Arthur. Can you give a little more of the detailed update on kind of what's you're expecting progress wise for both of those in terms of; a contracting; and b, going to FID? And then just broadly, kind of, the broader macro environment for incremental U.S. LNG or U.S. Liquefaction? Jeff Martin : Sure. Well, first off let me say thank you Michael for joining our call. And we've got Justin on the line with us. And what I'd like to do Justin, if you don't mind perhaps tackle the macro side first and then come back and maybe provide a project-by-project update on the progress we're seeing around our contracting of capacity Justin Bird : Sure. Thank you, Jeff and thanks for the question Michael. In terms of the market, I think, we're seeing continued growth in U.S. LNG exports this year, clearly dampened a bit by the hurricane season, but it looks like frankly LNG exports could set a record in November. It's really being underpinned by increasing demand and stronger prices in Asia. We're also seeing stronger prices in Europe. Prices in Asia have actually tripled since the summer. And really we think it's a demonstration that LNG demand growth is driven by recovery in global GDP unlike oil, which really is at mobility or transportation fuel. In terms of the longer-term in the LNG market we still think we'll see some short time oversupply. But we think over the medium term, let's call it 2023-2025 we see that the lack of FIDs over the past recent years will create a situation where demand will exceed supply and we see that continuing. I think for us it's importantly because as Jeff mentioned, he talked about our uniquely positioned LNG business I think we have an opportunity to really capitalize. We will have Pacific and Atlantic access. We're bolstered by Sempra's strong balance sheet. And we have and continue to create strong relationships and partnerships in the LNG space. So we think our business, our franchise will be more successful over the medium and long term. In the short-term let me talk about our development projects. As Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are hoping to take FID and plan to take FID at the end of -- during this quarter prior to the end of the year. The offtake for that project is completely sold. And shifting to Cameron phase 2, we are continuing to work with partners on optimizing the design of that phase, really building on the strength of Cameron phase 1 and leveraging that to really create expansion and brownfield economics. In terms of the timing of that development, we are progressing and we're working closely with the partners, but we don't have a specific time line for that. On Port Arthur, we previously announced that we were delaying final investment decision to 2021 and that's based on where we are what we're seeing in the market. But we are seeing a little bit of rebound in the short-term market. We're frankly seeing some challenges -- practical challenge just as a result of COVID. LNG tends to be a face-to-face business. And although, we are all starting to use conference calls it's still I would say slowing down the process a bit. We still have continued conversations. We're continuing to co-develop with Saudi Aramco, and we think Port Arthur really has the opportunity to be not only a successful first phase, but truly one of the great LNG mega projects in the world. So again, we're very excited about our development prospects. As we've previously stated, we will not develop a project until the market is ready for it. We are -- show a tremendous level of capital discipline. We at Sempra LNG compete for our capital. And really we're here to create value for Sempra's shareholders. So we think we have uniquely positioned franchise and we see both in the short-term and then the medium to long-term continued success. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. I had a follow-on, but it's very unrelated. It's probably for Allen. Just curious Allen, any thoughts if I remember correctly Oncor has got to file a rate case next year. Any thoughts on; a, given the just the broader economic environment with COVID you could delay or push out that rate case; and b, if you can any kind of early read on whether this is kind of a move-the-needle type of request, or is this just a mandatory coming back in, but it's not something that's going to drive significant rate pressure on the customer? Jeff Martin : Go ahead Allen. Allen Nye : Sorry Jeff. You're 100% correct. We are required by PUC rule to file our next rate case by October 1 of next year. And so we're currently planning on that, working on that. You're also 100% correct, very unusual test year to say the least. Now we will -- we have the opportunity to make no measurable changes and normalize some of our test year data. But it's unquestionably going to be an unusual test year. I think there are four rate cases presently scheduled for the PDC to hear next year. Ours is, obviously the biggest. I have not had any discussions or received any feedback so far from the Commission as to whether they would like to delay. Certainly to the extent the state would like us to delay. It's something we always work very well with the state and the intervenors and we would consider that. It's just not a topic that we've addressed yet. With regard to what we'll be asking for, we're putting that together right now. We haven't been in a few years. So we'll just have to wait and see. I can't really predict what we'll be asking for. We're obviously cognizant of what other utilities and their experiences recently at the commission. I would just simply say, their rate cases are obviously very specific, specific to the time you file, who the utility is and what the facts and circumstances are. And I think our history has shown we have good relationships. We've been a good player, a good supporter of ERCOT market. We've done everything the commission has asked us to do. So we feel like we're in a good position going into next year. To the extent we have to file, we're anticipating that we will unless we hold otherwise. And we're anticipating that we'll do what we've always done and we'll work with stakeholders and we'll try to come up with something amicable and reasonable for the customers and for us. But that's kind of where we stand on the rate case. That answers your question. Michael Lapides : Now that\u2019s super helpful Allen. Much appreciate it. Thank you guys. Allen Nye : Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thanks Michael. Operator : We'll hear from Ryan Levine with Citi. Jeff Martin : Good morning Ryan. Ryan Levine : Good morning. In light of the 2035 the California electric vehicle policies, what are your current thoughts around incremental infrastructure needs to prepare for these policies to enroll to semper play in this trend in light of the strong adoption rates in the in San Diego market? Jeff Martin : Thank you for that question. We do have a leadership position in the San Diego region with respect to electric vehicles. I think we've got roughly 60,000 on our system today which scores very high on a per capita basis. And I got to tell you, I recently published an article in the World Economic Forum about the importance of clean transportation. And I was quite auditory about Governor Newsom's leadership position here. So this -- I said this earlier in my comments, this is a state that's justifiably prideful about their leadership position around all issues of clean energy. And when you think about -- I think statewide, it's roughly 40% of the greenhouse stack is associated with transportation, here in the San Diego region, it's just over 50%. So a lot of times people who talk a lot about the clean energy transition we'll focus on things which are relatively small and don't move the needle. This is probably the most complicated issue globally, if we're going to be successful about combating climate change. And I really think the state is real committed to progress here. And the final comment before I pass to Kevin is, people don't fully understand the circuit-by-circuit changes you have to make is utility, what we refer to as make ready work. You start adding two or three electric vehicles to a street. You've got to upgrade the electrical system.  So there will be a tremendous amount of distribution infrastructure that will be required to accommodate the type of penetration we're expecting to see with electric vehicles. And Kevin perhaps you could talk about some of the things at SDG&E during this area. Kevin Sagara : No. Thank you for that question Ryan. We are really excited about the Governor's executive order. At SDG&E, we've gone a long way already of having a significant amount of work around charging for electric vehicles. Some of our newer programs have to do with exploring vehicle to grid. And so taking like school bus fleets or something and charging those at the right time and then pulling only electricity offer at another time like Jeff mentioned all the make ready work presents a big capital opportunity for SDG&E over time. And as Jeff mentioned at the beginning, we're not going to get where we want to go from a climate perspective and carbon -- reducing carbon intensity without addressing the transportation sector and that's why this executive order was so important. And like we said a big opportunity for SDG&E, but also at SoCalGas, right? And so we can see on the medium and heavy-duty side, we've got by 20, 45 go to zero-emission vehicles there. And so when you think about that particular segment right now there's some back of clarity whether it's electric or hydrogen fuel cells, but my own belief is we're leaning more toward the hydrogen side. And like we've spoken about in the past refueling opportunities around hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen itself for the gas company is a tremendous opportunity. So it's going to help both companies a lot and we're happy to see this. Jeff Martin : I would also add Ryan that Trevor and I are also Board members in Oncor and Allen puts on a really thoughtful strategy session every fall. And Trevor and I just in the last couple of weeks joined Allen and one of the things we talked about really is the opportunity for clean transportation in Texas. What's unique in a lot of Allen service territory is the commute time in Texas is shorter than it is in many communities in California. So certainly we think Texas is not going to move at the same pace as California. But going back to his footprint in the state of Texas, this is another long-term upside for that franchise. Ryan Levine : Great. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. You will hear next from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Trevor. Jeff Martin : Good morning. Anthony Crowdell : Just hopefully two quick questions. Jeff, one is the LDC multiple valuation multiples have really come in maybe over the last 12 months. I'm curious if you think that's more temporary or is that something that's going to continue just for the next couple of years? Jeff Martin : Yes. Thank you though. For many of us who have been around the industry for a long period of time. We've traditionally seen LDCs trade at a premium to electric utilities largely because natural gas could be stored. It was viewed by many as being more lightly regulated whereas electricity largely SBUs instantaneously intensely more politicized. I would tell you I think that in my personal view I think it's temporary. And here's my base case for that. I was moving into takeover and run SDG&E in the fall of 2013, I think I stepped in in January of 2014. And many of you will recall one of the common themes in our industry was the death spiral of utilities, particularly electric utilities and how embattled they were going forward. And I think what people couldn't see at that time was that they were taking steps particularly on the power generation side to change the feedstock for power generation. As you decarbonize that commodity, it became a real weapon to actually electrify the United States and compete on the transportation side, which was similar to Ryan's question just a few minutes ago. So an entire new landscape opened up in front of those electricity businesses. And now we all talk about electrification like it's a secular trend and it is. I personally think it is one of the most dominant trends in our industry is electrification, but if you go back six or seven years, there were a lot of dark clouds on the horizon to the electric business. And I will tell you I think the European sentiment is further ahead of the United States in this area. There is a growing recognition outside the United States that a central player in leading energy transition will be our LDCs. That's because they've got this prior investment, which is quite significant and they've got a leadership position if you go country-by-country and continent-by-continent most of the hydrogen work is being led by LDCs. And that's one of the reasons that I've been participating in the World Economic Forum is to help us track some of the new developments in this area. We think that SoCalGas, which is the largest LDC in the Western Hemisphere will be the natural leader here in the United States and Scott, Jerry and his team I believe have 10 to 12 projects pending currently. And we've talked about this just in the last couple of weeks Anthony, we're going to make an entire breakout category in our March analyst conference around the clean energy transition and innovation and technology across each of our portfolio companies. So I actually think that LDCs will be valued differently in the future at a more premium value. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then just lastly I guess, Sempra, Jeff, you have this really high-class problem. There seems to be very little question or even on the earnings call like there's no question to the earnings whatever that earnings power of your the company's core utility businesses. With most of the questions are uncertainty coming from maybe the smallest portion of the Sempra family, I guess, how do you move the focus away from the LNG business or maybe Mexico and focus more on the core earnings power of SDG&E and SoCalGas? I'll leave at that. Jeff Martin : Well, I think, it's \u2013 I'll start by saying, I appreciate the positive comments about the earnings power of the company. I spent a little bit of time earlier in my remarks talking about, how we've seen steady improvement in the core earnings power of the company both in 2019 and in 2020. It's not just earnings growth. To your point Anthony, it's also improved earnings quality and earnings visibility. So I think over time that will get valued into the stock. And I think going to your larger point about our unregulated businesses, you should expect that Sempra over time, will become increasingly have higher content in its regulated businesses. So we think that, our utilities will become a larger part of our earnings stack, as you go forward in time. And that's kind of a signal about, how we expect to manage both Mexico and the LNG business. And I think part of what we need to do, there is, we just need to execute cleanly in Mexico and execute cleanly in LNG. I spent some time earlier on today's call, talking about some active steps we're taking to make sure that we can demonstrate that value to the market. We're quite optimistic actually. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Jeff, you are not in my group in the IMX next week though, I want to wish you any early happy Investment Day. And thanks so much for taking my question. Jeff Martin : I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll continue next from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Jonathan Arnold : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Jeff, I would appreciate that you are in this quiet period on the franchise agreement. Are you able to share anything about the process from here which how it works and what the timing would potentially be for those have been used? Jeff Martin : Yeah. There's been a lot of obviously good research publications around this. We talked about it a little bit more effusively on our Q2 call. But because we're in the quiet period Jonathan, I have to apologize. I think it's really important for us to respect the process that this city has underway. I would just say that, Caroline Winn and the team are really excited to work collegially with the city, and I made this point in my prepared remarks, I think we have an identity of interest here, right? We're both looking to serve the benefit of the same people and I remain optimistic. Jonathan Arnold : And do we know is there going to be some sort of open bidding or hearing? Can you talk about at all? Jeff Martin : I would just say that, there was an invitation to bid process that process came to a conclusion in October. We made a filing, which we thought was competitive at the time that the bids were due. They have not announced whether there is one bid or more bids. They had not announced when they plan to specifically open the bids and what the definitive process will be. But I think it's reasonable to expect that the process will be finished this quarter and we feel quite good about the bids that we've submitted. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And if I may just on to your comments about \u2013 pick up on your comments on 2021. I mean, earlier in the year you explicitly said you were positively inclined around the 2021 number \u2013 given this year like last quarter you did the buyback or we doing accretive something like that. I'm just curious what hold you? Why would you \u2013 what's happened to change your view? Jeff Martin : Yeah. I'm actually smiling, because I did actually say that. And I was optimistic then and I'm optimistic now, and I think we tend to take a relatively conservative approach to planning. What I will say is this is, if I was an outsider looking at the company, your first question is, is there something that you're not aware of that makes 2021 not look good or not. I would say, this is, we had a great year in 2019 and we have improved portfolio with improved earnings power. We're having a heck of a year in 2020. And it's in a really difficult environment, right? I mean, our employees have really been challenged to both work at home and we've got a ton of people in the field working. So I think we're set up extremely well for 2021. I made a comment earlier. I think you should expect to see the power of our earnings growth continue to be from our three leading utilities. And next year, we're really excited to see full run rate earnings from Cameron. So there's no real back story here other than us going through the planning process and we will have an updated view on 2021. I'll be excited to come back to you. Jonathan Arnold : Terrific. All right. Thank you very much. Jeff Martin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear next from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : Good morning. How are you going? Jeff Martin : Great. Paul Patterson : So just sort of follow-up on the Michael Lapides question, on sort of the natural gas outlook. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the LNG and I apologize if I missed it, quite distraction here. But the LNG next decade announcement and methane in Europe the concern there I guess. Any thoughts about that, or any trends or anything you're seeing? Jeff Martin : Yes. I'm glad you asked the question, Paul. I would say, I view it a little bit as the red here and white. RNG was forming a partner with us in the Cameron facility. Obviously, Total is our partner now. We have MOUs for the full capacity of Cameron expansion. RNG is in a little bit different position relative to Total, but I don't see any read-through from RNG to any impact on our LNG program. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. And then just when do you think we might see the end of -- or the conclusion of the Aliso Canyon? And I know from quarter-to-quarter there's been some sort of small movements that seems to me on the activity there. But when do you think we'll get some closure I guess -- more closure with respect to the Aliso Canyon litigation? Jeff Martin : Yes. The way I would think about it is you'll recall that we had a catastrophic equipment failure back in 2015. And out of that there arose really what I think about as three buckets of risk and exposure that we've been actively managing. The first of which was from a group or coalition of government plaintiffs which we resolved in 2019. Justin Bird, who's now in our LNG business was our lead executive to help us resolve that. And now Paul, there are two remaining buckets that were managed in the first which is the civil litigation process. We're engaged in those activities. You saw that last quarter, we recorded a charge related to the civil litigation and our settlement discussions there. What you're looking at in this quarter is the ongoing process we have at the commission on what we might lose to SoCal, the penalty phase and that just shows the nature of our current discussions around trying to settle that process with the commission currently. Paul Patterson : Okay. And when do you think it might all be sort of finished? Any idea? Jeff Martin : No. Any time you talk about litigation, we're going to be reticent to provide a lot of forecast about the timing of it. I would just say that we have good positions in both matters. We're working collegially with the folks that we should be working with and that's reflected in both our Q2 results and our Q3 results. Paul Patterson : Okay. Awesome. It was my questions. Jeff Martin : Thank you. Paul Patterson : Thank you. Bye. Jeff Martin : Yes. Really appreciate it. So as I come to the end of today's call, I wanted to thank everyone for joining us. I know that there's like a dozen other companies that are reporting this morning. I hope everyone continues to be safe and healthy. And feel free as usual to reach out to anyone on our IR team if you have additional questions and this concludes today's call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Sempra Energy Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Nelly Molina, Vice President of Investor Relations. Nelly Molina : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call for Sempra Energy. A live webcast of this teleconference and the slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section. With us today on the line, we have several members of our management team, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra LNG; Kevin Sagara, Group President; Don Clevenger, Chief Financial Officer of Oncor; and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. All of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 25, 2021, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. Lastly, as you know, due to our filings in the US and Mexico, we're limited in what we can say about the proposed IEnova's exchange offer and we'll be unable to respond to questions about these transaction. With that please turn to Slide Four, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Martin : Thanks a lot, Nelly, and thank you all for joining us today. To start, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our employees and partners for their dedication and professionalism throughout 2020 in continuing to serve over 36 million consumers. I'd also like to briefly touch upon the extreme weather events that transpired last week. Our thoughts are with all those who have been impacted and the Oncor employees who are tirelessly working to maintain the integrity of the grid in Texas. We've often discussed our investment strategy and how it's focused on building 21st century energy networks or transmission and distribution investments that are essential to modern life, and the past year really highlights the importance of those essential services and why new investments will be needed to keep the grid growing and improving its resiliency. I'm pleased to report that in 2020, we also delivered strong financial and operating performance, creating positive momentum heading into 2021, as we build on our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. Turning to the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported full-year 2020 adjusted earnings of $8.03 per share, the highest in our company's history. We also exceeded our previously increased 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range, which reflects our firm resolve to always try to meet or exceed our commitments. In line with this positive momentum, we're reaffirming our 2021 EPS guidance range. I'd also like to mention that this guidance range excludes the impacts of the proposed IEnova exchange offer and the sale of a non-controlling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners. Additionally, for the 11th consecutive year, we're raising our dividend. Our Board of Directors approved an increase to our annualized dividend to $4.40 per share, from $4.18 per share. While future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, we plan to target a 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio. This demonstrates our commitment to generating value for our shareholders by continuing to grow the dividend, while also reinvesting in the future growth of the business. Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll highlight some of our more notable accomplishments for the year. Our strong performance is attributable to our strategic focus on value creation, a track record of disciplined execution and operational excellence. We're proud of our many accomplishments in 2020. We continued to advance our capital plan with approximately $7 billion spent in 2020, which continues to be anchored around safety and reliability investments at our US utilities. We also completed the sale of our South American businesses in June, amidst the backdrop of a global pandemic and international travel restrictions. This was a terrific accomplishment and a credit to our talented team, and marks the full completion of our multi-year strategic capital rotation program, which has allowed us to successfully reposition our business in what we believe to be the most attractive markets in North America. In line with our consistent focus on creating value for our shareholders, in December we announced a series of integrated transactions intended to simplify our energy infrastructure businesses under one growth platform. This platform is also intended to create scale and strategic alignment, while unlocking value by selling a non-controlling interest to a strategic partner. Trevor, will provide an update on the progress later on in the presentation. Financially, we've achieved strong results raising our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range last June and today, significantly exceeding that increased range. Additionally, we made great progress on our five-year capital plan, while also executing a $500 million share buyback program. Fundamentally, across our US utilities and infrastructure platforms, we remain focused on investing and growing our businesses. And to a point that I've made previously, we're allocating capital into a lower-risk portion of the energy value chain in what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America. That really is the centerpiece of our strategy and is reflected in the strength of today's results. Please turn to the next slide. Our 2020 accomplishments are a testament to the remarkable growth we're continuing to see at our utilities. Our 2020 financial results were underpinned by strong performance grounded in safety and reliability. We also ended the period with approximately $37 billion of total combined rate base of which nearly 74% is from electric T&D investments. So the key takeaway here is our two-year capital rotation program was specifically designed to build out this position as a leader in our North American energy networks in order to improve the strength and consistency of our financial results, which has clearly been demonstrated over the last several years. Looking to the future, we believe our Utilities platform will benefit from growth opportunities associated with serving the largest consumer base in the United States and operating in markets with the highest concentration of manufacturing and industrial production that in combination, make up nearly a quarter of the total GDP of the United States. In addition to growth, I also want to mention several other competitive advantages that allow our utilities to be successful in a variety of market conditions, such as decoupled revenues in California. Constructive authorized ROEs averaging just over 10% and constructive regulatory environments that support serving growth and investing to meet bold sustainability goals that further our efforts to decarbonize energy and also improve the safety and reliability of our system. As an example, our California Utilities have over 10 hydrogen research and development projects. We expect to showcase as well as other innovations that we have underway at our Investor Day later this spring. Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide both business and financial updates. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. We've made substantial progress on the announced Sempra Infrastructure Partners integrated transactions since our last business update call in December. As these transactions continue to advance, we wanted to re-emphasize our key objectives and expectations. By simplifying the ownership structure of Sempra LNG and IEnova under Sempra Infrastructure Partners, we believe this new streamlined platform will offer scale benefits and portfolio synergies as we continue to grow the business by advancing investments in cross-border renewable opportunities, large-scale integrated LNG projects and other investments in energy networks. Overall, it's our expectation that these integrated transactions will simplify our business model, strengthen our balance sheet and highlight significant value in the underlying businesses. Please turn to the next slide and I'll review the expected timing of this process. We continue to make good progress, and I'd like to highlight that we plan to complete the exchange offer and announce the sale of the non-controlling interest by the end of the second quarter. While timing is important, getting to the right partner and the right value is what is driving this great initiative. Additionally, I want to emphasize that while these two integrated timelines are part of our overall execution plan, the exchange offer and the sale of the non-controlling interests are advancing independently and are not contingent upon the other's timing. Please turn to the next slide. We've had several positive developments this past quarter at our US utilities and infrastructure businesses. At our US utilities, we executed record capital investments in 2020 of nearly $6 billion, continuing our focus on grid modernization. At SoCalGas, we're proud that we achieved approximately 20% methane reductions below 2015 levels, which is five years earlier than mandated. Moving to Oncor, we continued to see strong growth throughout the service territory. In the fourth quarter alone, Oncor connected approximately 18,000 new premises, which brought the full-year total to approximately 77,000. This is a 20% increase compared to 2019 connections, which is an amazing figure and reflects the best organic growth rate Oncor has ever experienced. This is particularly noteworthy, considering the backdrop of the global pandemic. On the transmission side, Oncor set a record for interconnection requests in 2020, driven by continued strong development activity in utility-scale generation with a focus on the renewable and battery storage markets in their service territory. Also, Oncor completed six major transmission projects in West Texas, totaling approximately 260 circuit miles and approximately $300 million of investment. Shifting to our infrastructure businesses. At ECA LNG Phase 1 reached final investment decision this past November, and we subsequently provided TechnipFMC with full notice to proceed under the EPC contract. The total expected capital investment is approximately $2 billion, which includes an equity contribution of approximately $250 million each from Sempra LNG and IEnova. And in December, an affiliate of Total took a 16.6% equity stake in the project. Shifting to Mexico, we continued to advance our pipeline of construction projects focused on improving the country's energy security. The Don Diego Solar project reached commercial operations and recently, IEnova announced an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in ESJ. Additionally, last week IEnova CEO, Tania Ortiz, and Energy Minister, Rocio Nahle, commissioned the Veracruz refined product storage terminal. As a reminder, the Veracruz marine terminal is situated in the largest Mexican port on the Gulf Coast and is expected to be one of the largest fuel terminals in the country with the capacity to serve 2.1 million barrels of refined product. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll review our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $414 million or $1.43 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $447 million or $1.55 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $553 million or $1.90 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings of $447 million or $1.55 per share. Full-year 2020 GAAP earnings were $3.764 billion or $12.88 per share. This compares to 2019 GAAP earnings of $2.55 billion or $7.29 per share. On an adjusted basis, full-year 2020 earnings were $2.350 billion or $8.03 per share. This compares favorably to our previous full-year 2019 adjusted earnings of $1.911 billion or $6.78 per share. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the full-year 2020 adjusted earnings compared to last year was affected by the following key items, $146 million of lower earnings due to the sale of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020 respectively. This was offset by $284 million of higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase 1 commencing full commercial operations. $81 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities from higher FERC and CPUC base operating margins, $63 million of lower losses at Parent and Other due to lower net interest expense, and higher income tax benefits, $57 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities from the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 associated with an income tax expense memorandum account that track differences between actual and forecasted estimates from 2016 to 2018, partially offset by income tax benefits in 2019 from the release of our regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for the excess deferred income tax balances that the CPUC directed to be allocated to shareholders in a January 2019 decision. $51 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to increased revenues from rate updates to reflect invested capital and Oncor's acquisition of InfraREIT in May 2019. And $41 million of higher earnings from Sempra LNG's marketing operations, primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices. Lastly, I'd like to highlight that we're making a few changes regarding our financial guidance going forward in 2021 and beyond. We're continuing to work on ways to provide you a cleaner and clearer view of our operational performance and financial results. And after various discussions with a number of our investors and sell-side analysts, starting in the first quarter of 2021 we will be adjusting out foreign currency and inflation effects, as well as unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses. This change is incorporated into our reaffirmed 2021 guidance range. Reporting our earnings with these items adjusted out allows for greater focus on earnings from ongoing business activities, and we appreciate all the input we received on this change of convention. Please turn to the next slide. Over the last three years, we've successfully narrowed our investment focus to T&D investments in what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America. And those of you who have followed us over the last three years have seen the difference this has made. Since 2017, we've transacted on approximately $27 billion in enterprise value, while still growing our adjusted EPS annually by approximately 14%. Not only has our adjusted EPS growth been exceptional, but the overall adjusted earnings quality has substantially increased providing greater visibility into future cash flows. We're proud of where our business stands today and believe we're well-positioned to continue providing strong financial results. With that please turn to the next slide, where I will review our new five-year capital plan. Last year, we laid out our record five-year capital plan of $32 billion. And when rolling our plan for this year, we continued to see robust opportunities to invest in our US utilities and infrastructure businesses. In 2021 to 2025, the capital plan is anchored by $29 billion of US utility investments, which represents over 90% of our total capital plan and is the largest utility program in the company's history. For SDG&E and SoCalGas, safety and reliability continue to be at the forefront of our capital plan. We're making investments at both utilities to enhance our pipeline infrastructure through our risk assessment mitigation phase and risk spending accountability reporting. At SDG&E, we continued to advance our industry-leading Wildfire Mitigation Program by investing in innovative and cutting-edge technologies to keep our communities safe. And at SoCalGas, we're making strides toward achieving our greenhouse gas emissions reductions and executing on a strategy to achieve at least 40% reduction in methane emissions by 2030. Additionally in Oncor, the capital plan is attributable to tremendous organic growth that we're seeing. On the distribution side, Dallas-Fort Worth is the fastest growing metropolitan area in the fastest growing state in the country. This is coupled with continued investments on the transmission side, resulting from the increase in wind and solar generation as well as battery storage being interconnected into the ERCOT system. When compared to Sempra's capital plan we've shared with you last spring, we've identified an increase of roughly $1.1 billion of incremental utility CapEx in 2021 and 2022 combined. Lastly, we plan to fund our robust capital plan with cash flows from operations, as well as using some of the cash proceeds received from the proposed sale of a non-controlling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners, and other available sources. As we've historically done, we'll continue to be disciplined and evaluate all available financing sources based on the timing of our investments and what we believe is the most efficient for our shareholders. Please turn to the next slide, where I will review rate base projections. Our continued investment in safety and reliability provide strong projected rate base growth of approximately 9% annually from 2020 to 2025. By 2025, our combined total rate base is projected to be approximately $56 billion. Notably over that period, our rate base mix does not change materially with approximately 70% of total rate base from electric infrastructure, which reflects how well-positioned we are to continue supporting strong trends in electrification. Please turn to the next slide, where I will hand the call back over to Jeff to review our priorities for 2021. Jeffrey Martin : Thanks a lot, Trevor. As we turn our attention to the rest of 2021, we plan to continue our positive momentum. We've identified several priorities to capitalize on the critical role that energy infrastructure is providing in support of the energy transition. Our priorities include among others, executing health and safety programs to help mitigate COVID-19 risk for our employees, maintaining a focus on safety and operational excellence across all of our companies, continue to execute on utility-centered capital plan, delivering strong financial results and completing the Sempra Infrastructure Partners integrated set of transactions. I look forward to sharing more about how we're delivering on a sustainable future for all of our stakeholders at our Investor Day later this year. Please turn to the next slide. And finally, let me summarize for you our investment proposition, which we believe is differential to others in our industry and offers compelling value both in the near and long term. We're building a top-tier T&D infrastructure platform that's well-positioned to succeed in attractive markets, continuing to execute a robust capital plan with significant expected growth in rate base, growing our EPS and improving our earnings visibility, maintaining attractive and growing dividend and remaining committed to innovation, sustainability and leadership. Please turn to the final slide. In summary, 2020 was a record year for our company. Against the challenging economic and operating backdrop, we deployed a record amount of capital and produced the best financial results in our company's history, topping the prior year's record of adjusted earnings results by over $400 million. We look forward to continuing to execute on our value proposition in 2021 and remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks and we'll stop to take your questions. Before opening the call to questions, however, I'd like to remind you that we will not be discussing the exchange offer. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Martin : Morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : So as we're sort of thinking about the pending SIP so, Jeff, I know proceeds could be somewhat substantial, just given sort of the prior comments around the potential transaction multiple. In terms of use of proceeds, you obviously have an opportunity to reinvest for the buyback and de-lever. Any sort of priorities here and how much do you sort of envision could be recycled at the utilities just from an equity standpoint? And how should we sort of be thinking about potential limits with efficient redeployment of the proceeds in the near term? Jeffrey Martin : Appreciate the question, Shar. And I think the way we think about it is, we've gone through in our prepared remarks kind of what we think the critical success factors are for the transaction, and obviously one of the things we've identified in that order of criteria is to predict [ph] accretive transaction. So when you think about the use of proceeds, what I try to describe people is it's essentially dependent upon three factors. Number one, how well you successfully execute the general offer. Number two, how well you execute the sell-down process and that includes both the overall quantity of equity sold and the implied valuation. And to the point that you're getting to, the third part of that is a transaction, so to speak, is the use of proceeds. And one of the things we noted on the call is that you've seen not only the same $32 billion capital program roll-forward, but you're also seeing a higher portion of capital in the five-year plan allocated toward the utilities. So last year's plan was roughly 85% to 86% utility spending over the five years. This year's plans closer to 90%. And we did highlight for you that we think there's at least $1.1 billion of incremental CapEx just in our California Utilities in the next two years, and you've seen us raise the CapEx for Oncor by another $300 million over the five-year timeframe. So, we're going to look at both debt reduction, we're going to look at opportunities to fund additional utility CapEx. We will always test that against share repurchases. And there are scenarios where you could see us take in in-kind investments from investors, although it's probably a lower likelihood. So, what we're going to try to do is manage all three of those things; the tender process, the equity sell-down and then the efficient use of proceeds in a way that delivers all the critical success factors that we identified in our prepared remarks. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then just the amount of the sale kind of obviously remains unknown and we'll find out pretty sure where that stands, but should we be assuming sort of cash or a combo of cash and maybe an asset swap that could be like EBITDA-neutral or accretive, so swapping EBITDA for EBITDA, so how do we sort of just think about that? Jeffrey Martin : So, I wouldn't -- I mean, what we've said publicly is that we're going to sell a non-controlling interest, and so we'll always have controlled entity going forward. We have a very robust view of this platform and what the value can create over time. But the most important thing is we're going to focus on doing that those transactions as I described to you as efficiently as possible. And I would focus probably most likely on cash transactions, but we're not ruling out the idea that we could do an asset swap or allow some to contribute -- someone to contribute an asset as part of the overall value. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And just one last housekeeping and then I'll pass it off to someone else is you obviously -- you kind of reiterated the '21 guidance, which I think from prior comments may have had some upside. Is that simply just, Jeff, a function of not jumping ahead of the pending SIP deal and the Analyst Day? So how do we sort of think about? Jeffrey Martin : I think you probably summarized it better than I could. I think both of those points are accurate. And I think, Shar, you have followed our company for quite a while, and I would tell you that we went through a relatively thoughtful process with our Board in 2018 to make sure we had the right strategy. And we really wanted to focus on North American sell non-core assets, make sure we're in the right markets. And I will tell you, if anything about last week in Texas and some of the challenges you're seeing in your industry, if it points to anything it's really the value of investing in the grid. And as you recall from some of our prior conversations, we have specifically avoided the generation marketplace, we've avoided being exposed to commodities and that's why being in a decouple marketplace like California is so important. So, you've seen over the last three years us be able to grow our EPS at about a 14% CAGR. And as we think about 2021, I would probably go back and just mention to you that think about how we did our guidance last year. I think it was on this call that we talked about our guidance last year, and some people were a little bit disappointed in the Q4 call of the 2020 guidance. And you recall, Shar, it was on the Q1 call that we guided to the high end of the range. And later in Q2, we went ahead and revised our guidance upward of $7.20 to $7.80. In the Q3 call last year in November, we guided at the high end of the range and think about what we've done, right? During the pandemic, probably the worst economic downturn in the history of our country, Sempra Energy has produced record EPS, we've produced record earnings and all five business units for the first time in the history of this company, each one of them produced record earnings results. So as we go into 2021, you should expect us to basically continue to look at getting the SIP transaction done, get further along in the execution of our capital program, specifically in our utilities, and come back to you with a view toward trying to always under-promise and over-deliver. Shar Pourreza : Terrific. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Trevor. I'll jump back in the queue. Jeffrey Martin : Thanks a lot, Shar. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Shar. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Jeffrey Martin : Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Hey, Jeff, Trevor. Thank you. I've got a couple of questions. So first just a clarification because I think on the comments, Trevor, you said announce the SIP sell-down by Q2. But if you look at the slide on the timeline, it has the announcement by the -- still by the end of Q1. So is it announced by the end of Q1 and close Q2, or is it announced at Q2? Jeffrey Martin : I think, the game plan is the slide is correct. We're going to look to announce the transaction and the sell-down next month. We hope to also launch our tender process next month but both transactions, Steve, are geared to close in Q2. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. And then just one other clarification in terms of the transaction being accretive. Would that also be ultimately to earnings per share accretive, not necessarily during '21 but just beyond most likely? Jeffrey Martin : I'm sorry, Steve, I'm not sure I understood the question. We definitely believe that the transaction will be EPS accretive, if that's the nature of your question. Steve Fleishman : Great. That's all I -- yes, I just wanted to clarify that. And then maybe, Jeff, you brought up a little bit on Texas. Could you talk a little to how you're thinking about what that event, if anything, means for Oncor and any investment needs? I know at times there's been talk of the utilities maybe doing battery investments or other things that could help out. Do you see any political risk also to Oncor in this process, even though it was clearly not a distribution event? Thank you. Jeffrey Martin : Yeah. Well, look, I would start, Steve, by saying I think the events of last week, which were in the Midwest, obviously in Texas and obviously Northern Mexico as well, they also impacted California, which we're also comfortable talking about if you'd like to go into that, but it was the most important event in the energy markets globally last week. And we've always started by thanking our employees for their hard work in the Dallas community and across North Texas and certainly, there's been a lot of people have been hurt by this and our hearts go out to all those folks. But as for Oncor, you recall that their job is really as a grid operator is to execute the commands of ERCOT in terms of load shedding just to make sure there wasn't a complete failure of the grid. I think one of the things is taking place in Austin today is we're going through legislative hearings. Our CEO, Allen Nye, is going to also testify at those hearings. But I think the most important thing is Oncor stood tall during last week's event. I think they are one of the more positive participants in the overall marketplace. That's also a view shared by the Governor, by the way. And I think what's important as we think about future reforms is I just want to be a little bit cautious, Steve, that we don't front-run the activities that are underway today at the state. There's going to be a full-scale investigation. The Railroad Commission will be involved, the PUCT, the Governor's Office and the PUCT obviously, but and all the interveners in the marketplace. So, I think what will happen from this is you'll probably find opportunities for the state to improve its resiliency. There is also a lot of generation as we've talked about on prior calls, it's in the interconnection queue, and we certainly expect that that will lead to additional investments in the T&D space. But look, I don't want to start talking about capital at this point. I just think that as you think about building that marketplace, which has the strongest economy, at least the growth economy in the country, we don't think that we're going to be spending less capital. We think that spending more capital we'll certainly be part of the solution. Steve Fleishman : That's great. And just since you mentioned before, just I am curious kind of because I think gas got very expensive in Southern California too, and I don't know if there's any issue in Mexico, but just could you talk about the impacts of that from last week? Jeffrey Martin : Yeah. You'll recall that Texas took up most of the news cycle, but they had a DC time, the Midwest that went down, obviously there were impacts all across into Louisiana, which had some temporary disruptions to our Cameron facility. Cameron is fine and still online and operating well. You'll also recall at one point in time, the Governor issued an order that natural gas in Texas had to stay in Texas to meet electric generation needs first before being exported. That obviously has impacts to Mexico. Mexico had rolling blackouts in four or five of its Northern states. So, we're working very closely with Tania, and you'll recall that we've got seven pipelines where we've moved gas across the US-Mexico exchange. And she was being quite helpful to Texas to make sure that people were not unnecessarily scheduling gas across that interchange, but she was also working very closely with CFE. So, you think about our LNG facility in Baja, which is a giant storage facility, it was critical in that process of serving the needs of Northern Mexico and Southern California. And again, the State of California called on our storage network at SoCalGas, which is a very critical piece of infrastructure here in the state. And what people sometimes forget, Steve, is that California sits at the Western end of the pipeline system. We don't have much, if any, indigenous production of natural gas in the state, so we're very reliant on events outside the state, like you saw last summer, for us to import power from neighboring states but also to import gas, particularly here in the wintertime. So it was a system-wide event in the Western United States, and I think what we feel great about is we really have been hitting this pretty hard with our investment community, Steve, is we are the picks and shovels to the Gold Rush, right? We're the company that's investing in grids, we're investing in storage and we're a big part of the solution today. And I think if you look at where the market is going, I think we've got the wind behind ourselves in terms of our investment thesis and we should expect to see continued strong capital spending across our enterprise. Steve Fleishman : Okay, thank you. Jeffrey Martin : Thanks, Steve. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Steve. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, Jeff. Two questions on regulatory or policy theme. First of all, can you talk about when you look at the rate base growth changes, meaning the old forecast and the new forecast, one of the thing that stands out is the Oncor and the SDG&E kind of capital spend trajectory have pretty big step-ups relative to the one you gave last spring. The SoCalGas one much smaller percentage-wise. Can you talk about the opportunity set at SoCalGas, and especially given some of the legislative and policy pushes to limit the growth of the natural gas usage in the State of California? Jeffrey Martin : Yeah. Thanks, Michael for the question. I will tell you that we certainly think that the theme of electrification is a hard secular trend. And I think if you think back to the Oncor acquisition in March of 2018, it was really premised that on that expectation that that trend would continue. So as you see us lay out today, we've currently got 74% of our US utility rate base is exposed to that dominant trend. But I would go back to a point I was making with Steve Fleishman too, which is there is really an untold story of the criticality of natural gas to support the energy transition. So, Michael, 80% of the world's energy emissions today related to carbon come from oil and coal. And by the middle of next decade, the most dominant fuel in the world will be natural gas. In fact, Royal Dutch Shell came out just yesterday and forecasted that the LNG trade would double 2040. So there is a strong recognition that the one country in the world has got it right and has reduced emissions the most has been the United States. So for last two decades, we've led the world in emissions reductions. Number one, by committing to renewable capacity; and number two, making sure we fuel switch from coal to natural gas. So when you come back to California, clearly, Michael, we had blackouts last summer and that was because we were over-reliant on imports. I think there is a recognition that natural gas is the natural partner to renewables, so I think we're going to have headwinds. We've got to tell a better story. The most important thing we can do, and Trevor talked about this, is we have to make sure that natural gas plays the appropriate role, but it's incumbent upon us as a company to limit fugitive emissions around methane. And that is very critical all across this country that we're on top of that. I expect to see the Biden administration likewise continue to regulate that area. But longer-term, natural gas, which we think over time will be replaced by hydrogen and green molecules, that will be the best way to get after heavy-duty transportation and the industrial side of the equation. So electrification can take you so far, but it will be moving from natural gas to hydrogen, we believe, and the green molecules that will support what we need to do to reduce emissions both in industry and transportation. So, I think you're going to continue to see the type of rate-based growth that you see in front of our utilities. And I'll remind you that when we got our rate case at SoCalGas, it basically approved a record capital expenditures because as you go forward in time, Michael, you've got to make sure that you maintain the reliability of that system but also that it maintains it in a safe way. So, we're going to definitely grow our electric side of our portfolio and as you can see by the middle of this decade, we expect to have $55 billion in rate base across those three utilities. We're very excited about. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jeff. One other question. Mexico, there is some interesting legislation that's been battered around there regarding reforms to the power sector. It seems like that would present some challenges to all privately-held or non-government owned power generation renewable conventional, et cetera. Can you just talk about that or can your team about that whether they think that legislation actually happens and gets done, and what the ramification would be for IEnova? Jeffrey Martin : Sure, no problem. I think what the administration is looking to do is they've proposed a set of reforms for the power industry. And there is a complex set of things that are embedded in the proposed law, but the one that's probably received the most press coverage is the attempt to really reorder the dispatch curves. As you know, typically market-by-market in the United States, lowest cost generation dispatches first, and particularly plants that have no or zero fuel cost like nuclear renewables. And I think with the downturn in the global economy, you got to remember that Mexico is a member of OPEC Plus, so they are a participant in the oil marketplace. And they have a little bit higher sulfur content in their fuel oil, so this is an opportunity for them to use more of their natural resources in power production. And what they're really trying to do is privilege in that dispatch curve that CFE's oil-fired plants would dispatch first. And the one that impacts the most are the IPP market participants that are actually using oil or natural gas in a competitive format. We're not in that business line. The only electric generation plant we have is connected to California. In fact, it's not even connected to the CFE grid and that provides support here in Southern California. It does impact our renewable portfolio but keep in mind, they're net short in electricity, so renewables will always dispatch. And this -- I think our Renewable business represents about 10% to 15% of the EBITDA in IEnova, and IEnova represents roughly 10% of the overall earnings of Sempra. But we think it's a manageable situation and I would also conclude on one thing, which is if the law is passed and it clears the Senate Chambers in the next two weeks or three weeks, it's got three fatal flaws. Number one, under the Mexican constitution, there is an implied covenant of fair dealings and open competition, so there will be constitutional challenges to the law. Number two, under the USMCA Agreement, there is also a requirement that governmental entities will not be privileged over state-owned entities. And then secondly -- I mean thirdly, we also have arguments that you can't pass it all like that and then retroactively apply it to marketplace without [ph] bilateral agreement. So, we have tried not to be in the middle of that fight, Mike. I think we've really set a course in Mexico to be an active participant in helping Lopez Obrador and his administration be successful. And that's one of the top reasons I think it was important that Trevor said in his prepared remarks that the Ministry of SENER, Rocio Nahle, joined us last week at the Veracruz terminal. We also had senior officials joining us at other development projects. So our goal is to help Mexico be successful. They need more foreign direct investment. They have a deficit in their infrastructure and this administration, fortunately, has been very committed to fiscal discipline. So, I think our job is to make sure that we're working in partnership with the government to advance the government's goals and it'll be interesting to see how the legislation you referred to plays out. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jeff. Much appreciated. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Michael, for joining us. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Hey, thanks for the time. So\u2026 Trevor Mihalik : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. So a couple of clarifications, if I can go back, from the call here. So first off, with respect to your desire transaction and timing, when you say the timing is separate and parallel, you're not saying that you would close one and say we're going to separate this out. You're just saying that, frankly, you can close on them in parallel but not -- or at least announce them separately, but not necessarily close. That slightly [ph] still encompasses this Mexican tender presumably, right? I just want to clarify that. And then separately, did I hear right that you sort of deemphasized taking assets in-kind or some other kind of asset swap earlier? Jeffrey Martin : Sure, I'll take both questions. The first is what we're trying to convey is that one transaction does not have to happen sequentially before the other one, right? So these can be pursued in tandem but not chronologically committed to one methodology. We certainly are intent on closing both of them expeditiously, and I would also convey that they're going forward in the ordinary course. We've had no disruption to our expectation. It's probably taken a little bit longer than we might have forecasted before. And I was joking with some people on the team, rarely are we criticized for being overly optimistic when you think about our guidance. But in this case, and I personally take responsibility for it, we thought we could get it done in Q1, but I think we have a high confidence level it will happen in Q2. And then the second part of your question, if you don't mind reminding me, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, just were you trying to deemphasize the asset swap side of this or are you thinking it's a cash proceed sale or otherwise? Jeffrey Martin : No, I think what I'm conveying to you is that we have talked to a broad list of investors, so you think about -- I think we've had this conversation before publicly. You think about focusing on people who are traditional infrastructure investors, and you've talked about focus on people who might characterize the strategics or strategic infrastructure investors. We're looking for people that can come forward and have an identity of interest with Sempra to build a very successful business. We think this platform can grow and we think it can grow aggressively. And what we're really focused on is what investor out there has a shared view of the franchise value of Mexico and a shared view of the franchise value of LNG. And whatever consideration they bring forward, we're certainly open-minded. I would tell you that it's most likely a cash transaction. I've never signaled that a potential in-kind transaction was the most likely. Although, there are opportunities for investors to contribute cash and in-kind investments. I don't see that as a high probability, but we're open-minded about it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. And lastly, sorry -- if I can clarify this as well. On the use of proceeds question again. You've raised your CapEx, nicely done with this announcement here. When you think about other uses, is there another uptick here in CapEx that we could see? I mean, potentially types of the Texas annual rehash in the fall here, or should we really think about whatever cash proceeds minus this $1 billion, that's principally going to be allocated towards, shall we say, debt buyback dividend et cetera? Jeffrey Martin : Right. And I think the nature of your question goes to this issue of why we've raised in-kind assets before because as you think about use of proceeds, this entire discussion very much is geared to how much equity do you sell. What's the implied valuation? Because that creates a pool of capital. And is that all cash or is that cash and partly in-kind? And I would tell you, when you think about use in that capital, we've tried to think about all the different permutations of whether it's 50/50 incremental CapEx and debt reductions or some other ratio. And we're pleased to be able to come forward today and mention the fact that even on our slides just in two businesses, we've identified incremental CapEx of $1.1 billion at SDG&E and SoCalGas over the balance of this year and next year. We've talked about in the past, Julien, I think on the Q4 -- on the Q3 call, that Oncor raised its overall capital program from $11.9 billion to $12.2 billion. And this is something we're constantly assessing all the time, so I would not rule out the opportunity for us to source or identify additional CapEx as we go through the year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Excellent, guys. Thank you very much. Best of luck. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you for joining us, Julien. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. With regards to SIP, is your goal to self-fund CapEx through SIP contemplate kind of like the full scope of potential LNG development opportunities there? Are there any other considerations here? And just lastly, just wanted to clarify when you talked about the sell-down being accretive, if that was specific to 2021. Just want to clarify if that was your thought there. Jeffrey Martin : So what I would say is in terms of accretion, we've always said the transaction is accretive. We haven't talked about years but I would just say generally speaking, the transaction is accretive out of the box. And again, this turns on use of proceeds and the things that I've outlined previously. And I'm sorry, the first part of your question was? Jeremy Tonet : Just as far as if this JV could self-fund all of [indiscernible]. Jeffrey Martin : Yeah, thank you for saying that. That is definitely one of our goals. They've got about over $1 billion of annual cash flows. So the whole goal of this transaction is to make sure that we continue to unburden Sempra's balance sheet to really grow aggressively our regulated utility platform at the same time that we're freeing up the balance sheet of Sempra Infrastructure Partners to self-fund its growth. So one of the things we've talked about, Jeremy, is making sure that we're working with the credit rating agencies and we've been doing this since last summer to -- when we complete this transaction that Sempra Infrastructure Partners will have an investment grade balance sheet and it will be able to self-fund all of these expected capital needs. The one exception may be Port Arthur, but it depends on how we approach funding out our obligations there and we would even consider bringing in equity partners at the project level if needed. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And just a last one if I could. When you read from the 2021 guide there and you talked about switching out the FX and commodity mark-to-markets there, did that have any impact on 2021 at all? Just wanted to be clear on that. Jeffrey Martin : Well, I would say when you think about year-over-year, obviously in 2020 there were some earnings such as our discontinued operations. I think it was close to $93 million of contributions from our South American businesses before we sold those. Generally, there are positive contributions from the items you just mentioned because they're one-time and they tend to inject a small amount of entropy into our earnings, I think in the conversations we've had with various owners, we think that it's not material. And I think anything we can do to keep doing what we've done over the last three years to improve our earnings quality is really important to our owners and that's why we took that slight change. Jeremy Tonet : Appreciate that and welcome the change as well. I was just curious when you reaffirm 2021, did that change impact your view on 2021 at all? Jeffrey Martin : No, it did not impact it. Jeremy Tonet : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Hey, thanks so much for taking my questions. Jeffrey Martin : Good morning. Stephen Byrd : Morning. So yeah, there is -- as you mentioned there is a pretty compelling hearing going on in Texas as we speak. And I guess I wanted to revisit an area that you all focused on in the past, which was energy storage and just get your latest thoughts. And we can certainly extend it beyond Texas, but just lessons learned in Texas as well as in California. Just wanted to make sure I heard your latest thoughts on the potential role of storage and then up in Texas specifically, how you're thinking about that. Jeffrey Martin : Yeah. Look, there is no question that resiliency is becoming a more important theme all across the US energy space, right? So, you saw some of the challenges we had in California last summer. Obviously, the challenges that people met in Texas surprised a lot of people last week. And I think what we really want to do is make sure that people understand the importance of gas storage. So, Texas has a lot of geology that supports natural gas storage. One of the things, Stephen, that you've seen, particularly on the East Coast and the Northeast as you've covered utilities, is the importance sometimes of having liquid fuel on site. So peak-shaving LNG is quite common on the East Coast, I think there's over 50 facilities. So as you think about future solutions for the State of Texas, I think part of it is to make sure that they've got a balanced energy strategy to continue to make investments in green energy. That will require future investments in transmission. But also making sure that not only are the existing natural gas and coal plants properly weatherized, and that includes the nuclear plant that went down last week too, South Texas Power. It also means making sure that you have reliability. And there's this old saying from someone who was an old-timers who one time pointed to a cold stack that's at a power plant and said that's what reliability looks like. Well, I'm certainly not an advocate for coal but I do think that by privileging natural gas storage and the geology that Texas has and looking at ideas either around electric storage or particularly, LNG peak-shaving, one of the things you should expect to do is make sure that they've got the appropriate reserve margin and they've got fuel that is available and callable to meet the needs of the state during events like they had last week. Stephen Byrd : That's helpful, and maybe just related on transmission. Obviously, your growth in Texas has been fantastic. It does look like the state could certainly use more transmission. I know in general you're supportive of that. From a process point of view and just sort of next steps as we think about Texas and what could come out of all the lessons learned here from what happened last week, how can we sort of think about the potential for further enhancements in transmission, grid reliability upgrades? I think we all appreciate that it's a general opportunity, but just sort of trying to connect the dots to figure out kind of where we go from here and what the process might look like. Jeffrey Martin : Yeah. I said this in an earlier comment, I want to make sure that I don't front-run all the good folks in Texas. If I look at this thing fresh up, we've got Don Clevenger, the CFO of Oncor, on the line. And I'll pass it to him in a minute, but we've recently gone through a strategy session with our Board where we looked at what it takes for the United States to get to net-zero by 2050. And one of the key issues is the most important thing is we march toward more renewables, green molecules, like we talked about before and hydrogen, as a significant expansion of our energy networks. So the biggest issue -- and there's different studies out there. There's a Princeton study and other studies. Some of them even have the electric grid increasing by 5x by 2050. So it doesn't matter what market you're in. This idea of electrification being a hard trend and the idea that distribution and transmission networks need to be extended -- expanded is really, really important. And I think we're as well-positioned as anyone, given our footprint in Texas and California. But maybe, Don, if wouldn't mind talking about your thoughts on Texas. And I know you don't want to get in front of the regulators in terms of what you think might happen, but you may just talk about, Don, how well-positioned you are with 1,100 different points in your system where generators will be connecting. Don Clevenger : Yeah. Sure, Jeff. Thanks. And that's exactly right. And if you just look at ERCOT queue, putting aside the events of last week, there's 7,200 megawatts of gas under review. There is 26,000 megawatts of storage under review and that's ERCOT-wide. In our system alone, there is 5,000 megawatts of storage, along with 9,000 megawatts of wind and 25,000 megawatts of solar. So there is certainly a lot of opportunity for additional transmission and generation interconnection that's going to come out of that as that continues to develop. And then when you look at just West Texas alone, 40% of the Delaware Basin, the oil and gas facilities -- 40% of the oil and gas facilities out there are on self-generation waiting to be hooked up to the grid, so we're still catching up out there. And the big loops like the Culberson loop out there continues to set peaks every year. So there is still a lot of demand out in that area and we'll continue to build generation out there for the oil and gas, as well as the renewables and the storage. Stephen Byrd : Really helpful commentary. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : Hi, everybody. Is there a way to quantify or frame the cash flow implications to the Texas freeze events on Oncor and to the extent that there is any at Cameron? Jeffrey Martin : I'm sorry, would you mind saying that one more time, please? Ryan Levine : Is there a way to quantify or frame any of the working capital fluctuations or cash flow implications at Oncor from the events of the last two weeks? Jeffrey Martin : Yeah. I would just go back and say one of the interesting things about Oncor just remind you, Ryan, is we're not involved in the commodity marketplace. As you see other participants that have an obligation to go procure gas or generate electricity or produce electricity, we're not involved in that business so we don't have any direct bills to go to customers. We typically bill the retail energy providers. Oncor finished the year -- I think their December 31 balance sheet had about $2 billion of liquidity. So, we don't see any material issues of liquidity anywhere within the Sempra family of companies. And I think, Ryan, this goes back to a point I made a couple of times. We're an infrastructure provider, right? We did not want to own generation, we do not want to be exposed to commodity and we only participate in markets where we're decoupled from the volumetrics exposure of customers' consumption. Ryan Levine : Okay, so you're not seeing any change in your receivables related to the retail providers or any potential regulatory assets that may accrue related to that? Jeffrey Martin : So in Texas and in California, there is a moratorium on shut-off, right, and there is a regulatory process that allows you to record regulatory assets. But in terms of liquidity, we don't see anything of significance. And if there is any issues with retailers, one of the things you're seeing in Texas is some of the retailers have raised their hand to be providers of last resort and they tend to be the retailers, Ryan, that have a stronger balance sheet and also own generation, but we're not seeing anything of material concern. And if we do have any bad debt-risk in the future, we certainly have a regulatory model in Texas, in California, where we can file for a regulatory asset. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then within Texas, it looks like you increased your CapEx guidance for 2022. What was the driver of that -- looks like $100 million to $150 million worth of increase? Jeffrey Martin : Yeah. So one of the things we talked about in our prepared remarks was that we see incremental CapEx in California of $1.1 billion. We've also seen, and you may recall this from our Q3 call, we raised our overall CapEx plan in Don's organization over five years by about $300 million. So, they went, Ryan, from $11.9 billion to $12.2 billion. But in terms of maybe providing a little bit more color, Don, about where you're seeing some of those increases in Texas, could you please supplement the response here, please? Don Clevenger : Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jeff. Yeah, when we raised that by $300 million, the main things we were looking at is continued growth in Texas that just continues to exceed what we project out in each five-year plan, and then an increased emphasis on maintenance as well. Not only traditional maintenance, but system hardening and resilience and we're always looking at what we need to do in that regard, and cyber because cyber is where we also continue to make a very hard to look at. Ryan Levine : Okay, and then last question from me. Do the events of the last couple of weeks change the conversation around ECA in terms of its use as an import facility or any of the contracts there? Jeffrey Martin : Now, it's interesting. You recall that we built that facility last decade as a re-gas facility, and it's fully contracted for 20 years and those contracts are in place and it will continue to serve its current role through 2028. And so I think this was just making sure that that facility was available to support both markets in Mexico and the United States, and they have ongoing obligations and contracts with CFE down there. But it does highlight something that's important, Ryan, which is the value of storage. So there's been a lot of, obviously, discussions around the value of electric storage, which I think has a great future, but the value of storage in California and I think the increasing importance of storage in Texas has really been highlighted in the last couple of weeks. Ryan Levine : Okay, great. Thank you. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Ryan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Trevor. Hopefully, just two quick questions. If I can focus on California first. I guess strong CapEx growth, you got I guess gas rate plan I guess in the decision in 2019 to 2020, I forgot, really supported the gas infrastructure and everything. But is there -- has there been any pushback on bills in California? Given the wildfire spend and you guys are really helping with policy initiatives, have there been any policymakers or parties involved that have pushed back on customer bills? Jeffrey Martin : Yeah. It's interesting. Kevin Sagara is with us on the call as well, but when I was at SDG&E I remember looking at some of the old strategy books from 1987 and 1990, and there was an embodying focus on making sure that bills did not get too high. This is something that we've been very focused on over multiple decades to make sure that the value of what we're providing is consistent with the value of what they're receiving. And I will tell you, we have relatively high rates in California. We expect those rates to go higher because of the needed capital spending, but what's most important and people miss this sometimes is our bills are well below the national average. And that's largely because we have very moderate weather here. And so many parts of the year and many parts of San Diego don't even have air conditioning. So because of the moderate weather, because of the commitment to energy efficiency across the state, you're incentivizing customers to use less. And as you do that, the per unit cost of electricity goes up, right? So rates probably continue to go up. We try to do everything possible to make sure that we meet those needs with energy efficiency and come up with programs to help people save on their bills. But right now, the annual bill is below average for the United States. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And I guess more of a high level, just it seems that the Sempra model capital recycling maybe showing non-controlling interest is maybe getting replicated in the utility space. But I guess I think of the utility space, Sempra may be one of the last one or one of the few non-pure play utilities left. If I could just get your thoughts on being one of the last ones of not being a pure play, just thoughts on that business mix? Jeffrey Martin : Look, I think for a long period of time, we've tried to say that we want to have the right strategy and we want to make investments that are consistent with areas where we can produce the best financial returns at the lowest risk for our utility investors. And we tend to focus on businesses that have substantially similar cost of capital and a model that provides substantially similar risk-adjusted cash flows. I think we've been successful in doing that and if you've covered the industry for the last couple of decades, you've seen people move into unregulated businesses and out of it. But the common denominator for people who have moved out of unregulated businesses, maybe they had challenges growing those businesses in a way or they've got a straddle or a stray on the issue of having a substantially similar cost of capital. And I think what you're seeing us do is we've made a very clear statement. We're going to be what we think is one of the most important owners of energy networks, specifically utility networks in the country. And we're going to be as well-positioned as any other provider to take advantage of what we think is important trends around electrification. And what you're seeing us do with Sempra Infrastructure Partners is make sure that we've sourced the lowest cost of capital to ensure that that business can self-fund. And when it self-funds, it really unlocks Sempra's balance sheet to continue to fund our priority, which is building out this network platform that we have in California and Texas. So as you see people who cannot grow outside the utility, they may hang a label of simplification on top of it, but you have to look back at how those changes in strategy has been helpful or not helpful to investors. I'm very deferential to how other companies run it but at our company, as long as we have an opportunity to add more value for our investors, I think it's something we're going to [ph] continue to do. And I'll actually add something, which I've been really intrigued by. When you look back over the last 12 months and think about the fact that our stock was trading at about $160 on February 19 of last year and ask yourself, have we added value to our overall franchise, specifically including some of the diversified investments that you're referring to, we've been able to bring two trains at Cameron online. It's transformed our LNG business and led to record earnings last year. We were able to sell both of our utilities in South America and de-risk our business model and bring back $5.8 billion of pre-tax proceeds. We've been able to improve our credit metrics, Trevor talked about this, and strengthened our balance sheet. We finished the year -- we had a target of 16% FFO-to-debt and we finished with 17%, and we're below a 50% threshold in debt-to-cap. We had record capital investments last year across both business lines, utilities and non-utilities of $7 billion. We raised guidance and exceeded guidance. We secured a 10.6% ROE at FERC on SDG&E's transmission assets. We bought back $500 million of stock. We took FID, the only FID in the world around LNG last year, and we announced this two-part SIP transaction. So what you should expect us to do is be very active about de-risking the model, always challenging ourselves about whether our unregulated businesses fit in our portfolio. And actually this underpins our transaction assigning a co-investor that has a shared vision for that business at the same time that we unlock Sempra's balance sheet and support our credit initiatives by ensuring that on a going-forward basis, Sempra Infrastructure Partner both has an investment grade balance sheet and the capability to fund all of its development initiatives. Anthony Crowdell : Great. That was very helpful, Jeff. Thanks so much and hope everyone stays healthy. Jeffrey Martin : Thanks a lot. I appreciate you joining us. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Sophie Karp : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Most of the topics have been discussed. I just had maybe a housekeeping question here. Could you give us some -- remind us on the status of the San Diego franchise negotiations, please? Jeffrey Martin : Yeah. I've got our Group President of California with us, Kevin Sagara. And Kevin, perhaps you could update our audience on where we're at with the franchise. Kevin Sagara : Thanks, Jeff, and thanks for the question, Sophie. So as you'll recall, last year the city ran a process that culminated a bid from SDG&E. And in that process, there were no other bidders. Since then, we've got a new Mayor, we've got a new City Council and in the spirit of cooperation with that new government, we agreed to extend our franchise out June 1 of this year. We believe the city is getting ready to issue a new ITB. We expect that to come out in the next month, hopefully. And they're tracking currently to the schedule that the Mayor put out when he took office in January, so we feel constructive about the process. As Jeff has said many times before, we're going to put our best foot forward. We lead in all the areas the city wants us to be good in, which is safety, reliability, clean energy, and we firmly believe we're the right partner for the city. So we're just looking forward to the issuance of this next ITB and putting our best foot forward. Sophie Karp : Thank you so much. That's all from me for today. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Sophie. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my call. Jeffrey Martin : Hi. Jonathan Arnold : A quick one on the CapEx that you're showing for Infrastructure, the $3.1 billion green wedge. Does that assume your current ownership and proportionate or is there some kind of an assumption around the two transactions embedded there? Trevor Mihalik : Yeah. Jonathan, that's completely external of the sub-transactions. And nothing has been put into this plan with regards to Infrastructure Partners, and so this really just represents the investments made at LNG and Mexico. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And then if that's the case then could you maybe just bridge the 2020 to '24 plan was I think $4.4 billion between the two segments are now at $3.1 billion. So just a reminder what's going on there, the -- is it a bigger '25 than '20 or something else than sort of timing? Trevor Mihalik : Yeah. So the difference there from last year to this year is we did put in place the Mexican terminals. So those projects have gone into operations and so that's not reflected in this prospective plan. And then ECA is also now kind of layered in. And while we did have it in last year's plan, we've solidified with the EPC contractor and that's layered in here as well. But predominantly, it's just those projects in Mexico that came online. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, and on the current basis. That's great. Thank you. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks so much, Jonathan. Operator : That will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Martin for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey Martin : Now, let me just conclude by saying we appreciate everyone attending our call. I'd like to acknowledge the challenges of the last 12 months and the significant impacts that everyone has had. We sincerely hope you all are saying safe and appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Per our convention, please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any additional questions. This concludes today's call. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nelly Molina. Please go ahead. Nelly Molina : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call for Sempra Energy. A live webcast of this teleconference and a slide presentation is available on our Web site under the Investors section. On the line with us today, we have several members of our management team, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra LNG; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Kevin Sagara, Group President; Lisa Larroque Alexander, Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer; and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. All of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 5, 2021, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. Lastly, because the offer period for our IEnova exchange offer is open, we're limited in what we can say about the exchange offer, and we will be unable to respond to questions about this transaction. With that, please turn to Slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Nelly. I'm pleased with our first quarter results and I think it sets us up well for the balance of 2021. You'll recall we shifted our market focus back to North America several years ago and have been consistently investing new capital in our utility platforms in California and Texas. This strategic focus, together with strong operational execution, are continuing to drive improvements in our financial performance. A second part of our strategy is focused on consolidating our unregulated investments under Sempra Infrastructure and we're making great progress there as well. Just last month, we announced our agreement to sell 20% equity interest in that business to KKR, and it's an important step for two reasons : First, bringing in a new strategic partner allows Sempra Infrastructure to strengthen its own balance sheet while also positioning the business to self fund its future growth; and second, this transaction sends a clear market signal about the value and expected growth of our Infrastructure platform. Turning now to the company's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $2.95. We're also affirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range. Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide both business and financial updates. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. We've had several positive developments at our operating companies this past quarter. At our California Utilities, we received a proposed decision for 2022 and 2023 attrition rates, which if approved, will provide greater support for safety and reliability initiatives as well as improved visibility into future earnings. Moving to Texas. In 2020, Oncor experienced its highest organic premise growth ever and we're excited to see the growth continue this year. In the first quarter alone, Oncor connected approximately 19,000 new premises, greater than the connections in the first quarter of 2020. Again, validating the underlying strength of economic and demographic growth in the region. Now shifting to our Infrastructure business. At Sempra LNG, we have begun engineering construction of ECA Phase 1 and continue to progress our LNG development projects. At Cameron Phase 2, we continue to work with our Cameron partners on the technical design of the project and to advance commercial discussions. At Port Arthur LNG, we continue to work with partners and customers to focus on options to reduce the project's greenhouse gas profile and continue improving its competitive position in the global energy transition. At this time, given this work and the continued impacts of the pandemic on the global energy markets, it is more likely that final investment decision at Port Arthur will move to next year. We will keep you updated as things progress. Moving to our Mexican business. We continue to advance our pipeline of development projects, focused on diversifying its energy supplies and improving the country's energy security. In March, we expanded the renewable energy platform by finalizing the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in ESJ and placing the Border Solar project into operation. Also, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we're making great progress on Sempra Infrastructure and the associated series of transactions. Just last week, we received the necessary regulatory approvals to launch the IEnova exchange offer. As that process moves forward, it's important to note that it does not have a minimum requirement to close. With that, please turn to the next slide for a short update on additional details of the pending sale announcement in Sempra Infrastructure. With the announced sale of 20% equity interest in Sempra Infrastructure to KKR, we've gained a strategic partner to help fund future growth. The $3.37 billion in proceeds is expected to be used to fund growth at our US utilities and to strengthen our balance sheet, and also establishes an implied enterprise value of approximately $25.2 billion. Equally important, we're pleased to be partnering with an investment firm that has a shared vision for growth in North America. Lastly, we expect to close the transaction in the middle of this year, subject to customary closing conditions and certain approvals from third parties and regulatory agencies. Please turn to the next slide where I will review the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $874 million or $2.87 per share. This compares to first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $760 million or $2.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2021 earnings were $900 million or $2.95 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $741 million or $2.47 per share. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items : $73 million of lower losses at parent and other, primarily due to net investment gains, lower net interest expense, lower retained operating costs and lower preferred dividends; $62 million of higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase 1 commencing full commercial operations in August of 2020; $35 million of higher CPUC base operating margin at SoCalGas, net of operating expenses; and $30 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to increased revenues from rate updates to reflect invested capital and customer growth and higher consumption due to weather. This was partially offset by $56 million of lower earnings due to the sales of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020, respectively. Please turn to the next slide. We're pleased to report a successful quarter, both operationally and financially, and we are affirming our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. However, before moving to the Q&A, I'd like to remind you that we will not be discussing the exchange offer. We'll stop now and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Just a couple of quick ones here. Jeff, now that the SIP is fully announced the transaction, can you maybe talk a little bit about proceed, expectations? The $3.4 billion is a big number. So curious to maybe get a sense for the regions and the businesses for reinvestment. I mean, obviously, Texas is a logical option with the economic growth. Do you have a plan for regulated versus LNG? Is it delevering, buybacks? So I'm curious there. Jeff Martin : This is a conversation that we've had a lot over the last 90-plus days. And I will tell you that I think as you think back over the last two or three years, you've seen us really focus on funding our utilities, right? So we've got a $32 billion five year capital program. It's a very large capital project. Close to $29 billion of that is dedicated to our utilities. So as we think about how we would use those proceeds, certainly, we want to make sure that we're funding growth in our utilities. And there will be opportunities for us to look at paying down parent debt and continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We've made great progress also over the last three years of improving our equity layer. So what I would say is when we get to our analyst conference, so right now, we're targeting June 29, we'll look forward to reviewing our 2021 guidance by that time to see if there's any adjustments that are needed. We will also, for the first time, Shar, issue our 2022 guidance. And in terms of our use of proceeds and expected average accretion over three or four years, we'll announce that related to Sempra Infrastructure, and that number will be included in the guidance that we provide at that time. Shar Pourreza : You actually just answered two of my questions in one, so that was pretty good, Jeff. And then let me just ask one last one. Just on the stake of Oncor, the 20% or roughly the minority position you guys don't own with TTI. Any sense if acquiring that remaining stake will kind of ever be a near term driver? Are there any discussions happening at all there? Just how to think about that. Jeff Martin : We do a very periodic strategic review with our Board. And I think you've heard us talk a lot about this long term secular trend toward electrification and how we've continued to reorient our portfolio toward transmission and distribution. So as you think about the outages in California last summer and some of the things that Texas has gone through, we really think the best risk adjusted returns near term and long term for our investors is to continue to take a leadership position in owning more energy grids. So as you think about renewables over the next 20 or 30 years potentially doubling across the country, we really think this grid position is going to be very important. So you're right in your assessment. We find Oncor to be a very attractive investment. It has a wonderful management team. We think it has a really important leadership position in the Texas market. We have good relationships with GIC and TTI. As you know, as a matter of convention, we tend not to talk about M&A type of opportunities, but I do feel comfortable confirming that I think our T&D thesis has been validated several times over the last couple of years, and that will be a continuing priority for our management team. Shar Pourreza : And then maybe just a follow-up. Just there could be opportunities in Texas to look at other systems that may be coming about as a result of other utilities looking to delever or simplify their story or whatever. If you were to look at inorganic opportunities, do you need a closure of Oncor to grow inorganically in Texas, or should we assume these are mutually exclusive events if an opportunity does come about? Jeff Martin : Yes, I would go back and say that one of the things that Trevor and I talk about a lot, Shar, is really the importance of really thoughtful execution around our current capital program. And I think over long periods of time, we were reviewing our total shareholder return over the last two decades, so just over 1,000%. It all goes back to being a really prudent, thoughtful allocator of capital. So we're very much focused on the sheer volume of opportunities we're seeing organically. We do always look at a lot of range of things from an acquisition standpoint, particularly projects more so than large companies, so we don't rule those type of things out. But our focus is on delivering a very, very big program that's right in front of us. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : So just maybe first on Texas and maybe this question is for Allen. Just curious thoughts on just now that we're a few months further from the Uri event, what did that all mean for your business in terms of future changes or investment opportunities that might come up? And anything that we should be watching from the legislative session that could impact your wires business? Jeff Martin : Just for the benefit of the larger audience, Allen Nye, the CEO of Oncor, is on the phone with us. And I'll just make a quick contextual comment, Steve, before passing to Allen, which is really proud of how our team responded during the crisis in February. I mentioned this in the comment to Shar, but I think the importance of T&D in Texas, as the state thinks about adding new generation, as it thinks about meeting its growth prospects, I think, will become increasingly important. One observation I'll note before I hand it off is, there's a lot of conversations around PUC reform or market reform, or increased capital spending around weatherization. I think one of the takeaways, Steve, is this was a really remarkable weather event, really, really highly uncommon. And it's very much focused on the supply side and making sure that weatherization is a real priority from the generation assets, Steve, all the way up the value chain going toward the wellhead. So I think this is probably, in the long run, going to be more about how we prepare the supply side, including the fuel side more so than expected market reforms. But I think we've talked with Allen and we think we're probably not going to try to front run the state in terms of what the expected outcomes are, but we have a lot of confidence we'll get to a good outcome from the legislature. But Allen, perhaps you could comment more on the different buckets that you expect conversations to occur in the legislature and at the PUC, if you could. Allen Nye : Obviously, we had a very traumatic event here in the state. And I think it's getting an appropriate and a corresponding response from both the legislature and the regulators. We're obviously in the middle of session, getting towards the end. But as of now, we have over 180 bills dealing with issues associated with the winter event. To Jeff's point, we're not seeing things that are likely to have significant market redesign type implementation. But generally, we see the current legislative session kind of falling into six categories : market governance and oversight; winterization; communications, both within the market and the customers; obviously, gas and electric coordination; customer and market protection; and securitization. And while we don't see overall market redesign occurring, we think there's significant momentum behind any number of those issues, and we're likely could see legislation path addressing each of those concerns or issues, rather. But frankly, it's too early to tell. We've got session going through May 31 and the possibility of additional special sessions. Similarly, the PUC has addressed eight areas of inquiry. They basically overlap many of the categories coming out of the legislature. Those areas of inquiry could obviously change as we get new commissioners appointed to the commission. So overall, probably not wholesale market change, likely action on each of those topics that I addressed. Many of them, some of them could impact us. Some of them could require additional investment on our system. As I said when I testified before the legislature, I believe and I think the evidence shows that our system performed very well and we did what we had to do. But obviously, there are things we can improve on and the things that we intend to improve on. And depending on what comes out of the legislative session, we'll make the necessary investment to achieve those ends. Steve Fleishman : And I guess, one follow-up on that is just the renewables build out in the state. Are you seeing any either delay or acceleration in renewables and batteries coming out of this event? Jeff Martin : On the generation side, we've seen an uptick in requests in Q1 over Q1 of last year. Last year, we were -- end of the year, we were around 180 overall generation interconnection requests. As of Q1 2021, we're at 194. So we've seen that uptick. I can't tell you what it's related to or what it's not. I know there's a lot of legislative action, [SB3], in particular, that can have potential implications to renewables. But so far, those are the numbers that we have on generation for first quarter of this year. And obviously, much as you would expect when you look at the Q, much of those are renewable solar and wind. Steve Fleishman : And then one question, Jeff, on LNG. Just seems like market conditions remain pretty robust, obviously more at least spot market conditions. How is that impacting your discussions on new contracts and moving forward with your growth projects, and just how are you feeling overall there? Jeff Martin : We continue to be very optimistic about our development portfolio. Steve, you recall on our Q4 call, we commented on some of the spot prices, I think, which set records actually at JKM, at least at that marker in January. We were talking about looking back at LNG trade last year and for the first part of this year. It has been one of the bright spots in the overall global energy markets. I think in part, it's attributable to this robust demand response we're seeing in Asia and low inventories in Europe. The consultants we work with think that by 2030, you could see the market climb to about 550 million tons per annum, and today, it's right around 365 million. So we're pretty optimistic about where we're at in terms of our development portfolio and particularly being able to access Asia. We talked about, at least Trevor did in his prepared remarks, Port Arthur. Obviously, this is a really large project for the United States and obviously for our company. We expect that we will probably move that FID decision into next year. But one of the things that's interesting is we're trying to improve our portfolio. I'll look at things like carbon capture and move into electric drive supported by renewables. I think the greening up of the value chain here in North America is something that the sell side and the buy side should follow, because I expect it will make America increasingly competitive over time. I would mention that ECA Phase 1 are going very well. In fact, our EPC contractor actually mobilized last month to begin some of the site preparation work, and that's one that we'll look to make updates on going forward. Then at Cameron Phase 2 probably has had the most activity. We're working with our Cameron partners through the funding of the pre feed work. This will also help us advance and optimize the overall technical design on that project, which we remain quite bullish on. After pre feed, the next steps, Steve, will be the engineering work for feed and moving forward with the EPC contract. And we're also making great progress on the commercial conversations with both Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Total. So that's advancing quite nicely. So I think as we look at it, we think the thesis that we've laid out to Wall Street about this supply demand gap in the middle of the decade continues to be validated. We've talked about this now for three or four years. So I think our portfolio will be well positioned going forward. And I think as you see, the higher coal use right now in Asia, particularly this year as compared to prior years, I think the importance of LNG as part of the clean energy transition is increasing in importance. Operator : We'll go next to Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Jeff, just big picture. Wanted to get your thoughts on sort of how are you thinking about, a couple of years out, Sempra's profile regulated versus nonregulated? And specifically, given sort of the valuation marker on the private side for the gas assets, is there opportunity for you to kind of wind down or liquidate a larger portion of SIP moving forward? Jeff Martin : As we've thought about it, you look back over the last three years, I think we've shown a real willingness, as a management team with our Board, to make changes to the portfolio all through the lens of trying to see if we can improve our financial performance. And we found opportunities where we're a seller when other people value our assets at a level higher than we value them. And you've likewise seen us be a buyer, particularly around our T&D thesis where we feel like that we can pick something up at a fair price in a market that's strategic to us. And as you think about those activities and being thoughtful about our capital allocation, we've been able to grow our adjusted earnings per share at about 14% CAGR. So we feel very good about the portfolio. In fact, we did a look back to our portfolio over the last 2 decades, and we've been able to grow our total shareholder return at just over 1,000% versus the S&P 500 is right around 400% total shareholder return and the S&P utilities at right around 314%. So we've been able to, over two decades, outperform our sector by 3x type of performance. I think it's this idea that you can put together a portfolio. And if you're really thoughtful and disciplined about capital allocation, you're always taking what the market gives you. And right now, we think we want to focus on growing our utility platform, both in Texas and California. We think we have a leadership position in both markets. So I think in the near term, our focus will be on growing our utilities and try to meet and fund the most capital efficient way that $32 billion capital program. At the end of the day, we're very excited about our partnership with KKR, but this was also an opportunity for us to source the lowest cost of capital to fund our capital program. So we're actually quite bullish on both of these platforms and look forward to growing them into the future. Durgesh Chopra : Maybe can I just quickly ask you for an update on the San Diego franchise agreement, where does that stand? Jeff Martin : This is something that is obviously a big priority to us. The city issued a new invitation to bid back in March. And Kevin, if you have other comments, feel free to supplement my comments. San Diego Gas Electric responded, providing a proposal on April 16th. Again, they were the only bidder in the process, and they are currently in [bilateral] negotiations with the city, and it's probably not appropriate given the state of those negotiations to characterize where we're at in that process. I would go back though and mention a couple of things that Kevin and I have mentioned on prior calls, which is we continue to believe there's a very strong alignment of interest between what the city is trying to accomplish for its citizens and what we're trying to accomplish for our customers. We feel very constructive about the process and we certainly look forward to continue and engage with the new mayor, Todd Gloria and the city council. Kevin, would you like to make any additional comments? Kevin Sagara : No, I think you've covered it, Jeff. Operator : We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So if I can go back to perhaps where we started at the top of the Q&A here. Can you elaborate a little bit on the comments on balance sheet strength? How are you thinking about debt paydown? Is this just relative to the lost cash flow from the sale, or are you thinking about proportionately deleveraging from where you are today? I just want to clarify the comments that you made in the prepared remarks, as well as any tax leakage you might be willing to share. Jeff Martin : I think that on prior calls, you may recall that we mentioned that we did not expect to have any cash tax consequences associated with the transaction because of the buildup of NOLs we have the kind of the 2024, 2025 time frame. I think the most important takeaway from my earlier remarks is that we're going to be in a position at our analyst conference, Julien, to provide our 2022 guidance, and I think that's the appropriate thing to focus on. The use of proceeds for this transaction will be important. I've talked about the importance of making sure that we can fund our capital program. There's nothing unique or nuanced about the balance sheet issue. I think you've seen us go from an equity layer that was closer to 40%, 41%, 42% in Q2 of 2018, and we finished this year, last year, on December 31 with a balance sheet that had an equity layer at about 51%. So we really have improved our balance sheet and thickened our equity layer. But as we look at paying down debt, we'll look at our various maturities, we'll look at our make whole payments, we'll get to the right economic decision, and we'll balance that with other offensive opportunities to fund our capital programs. So we feel good about the Sempra Infrastructure transaction. It was premised on sourcing lowest cost of capital, right, finding a partner that has a shared vision for growth and it's going to be accretive. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Actually, Jeff, if I can follow up on that last comment here. I think I heard you say three to four years of incremental accretion is the expectation for disclosure. Are you thinking about providing something on a consolidated EPS CAGR, like some of the prior Analyst Days here, or is it just going to be very narrow in terms of what the incremental accretion from the sell down is? Jeff Martin : Yes, I would just go back and say that one of the things we're excited about is going to the analyst conference to review, number one, 2021 and to publish, for the first time, 2022. And if you harken back to the Oncor transaction, what we tend to do is make sure, number one, that any accretion associated with this transaction is included in the guidance that we expect to present, that has not been the case to date in terms of the guidance we put out for 2021. And we tend to look at the overall impact of accretion over multiple years. I think in the Oncor case, we provided three to four year average accretion, that would be our expectation would be to adhere to that convention in June when we're all together. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And perhaps provide updates on organic capital spending at the utilities as well\u2026 Jeff Martin : That's exactly right. Operator : We'll go next to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : When you were talking about the LNG, I think you were mentioning carbon capture there and just wanted to follow up on that a bit. Just want to see if you thought the current 45Qs as the written right now are sufficient to provide economics to go forward with those type of projects right now or if more support is needed. And also, there was -- Shell collaborated with their LNG provider to deliver carbon neutral LNG into Europe. And I'm just wondering if you see this as like a bigger trend in the industry and I guess how Sempra thinks about that in general. Jeff Martin : Look, I will start by saying that we've long talked about the competitive advantages of North America relative to other places like Australia or Qatar or Iran, or Russia. And I think when you think about the fact that we have ample resources for natural gas in the United States, low price volatility, you've got certainty of construction here relative to other jurisdictions and you've got deep capital markets. We have always said, and I think most forecasters agree, the United States will lead the world in LNG exports for the next two or three years. As you think about other competitive advantages, I mentioned this at Port Arthur but also at Cameron specifically, we're looking at opportunities to make sure that we can green up the value chain so we have the most competitive form of LNG possible. And I think what you talked about at Shell, that will become increasingly common. But I think the United States, in particular, will take its existing advantages and will become more advantaged relative to our competitors because of the very things you referenced in. And perhaps, Justin, who is our CEO of our LNG business, can talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the role of both renewables and carbon sequestration in your LNG program. Justin? Justin Bird : Yes, Jeremy, I think on the 45Q question, yes, we do think that will play an important part as we look at carbon capture around our LNG and I guess, broader within the company. And in terms of what we're doing at our LNG projects, we are always looking for ways to reduce our emissions both on site and then from the gas coming in as well as the power that's coming into the project. So as Jeff mentioned earlier, as we look to potential electric drives, trying to increase the percentage of renewable power that would drive those as well as other ways to capture and reduce methane on our site, I think those are important drivers as we look to keep greening our facilities and frankly, the supply that comes into them. You made reference to the Cheniere-Shell deal. I think you will start to see more of that in the LNG marketplace. We are working with our customers and potential customers as to how we will track the emissions associated with that LNG, and then as to ways that the emissions with that LNG can be offset. So I do think you will see that play an important role as the market continues to grow. But as Jeff mentioned in his earlier remarks, I think what excites us most about LNG is the continued growth you see in the LNG around the world, frankly, as the rest of the world and us move toward energy transition and cleaner energy. Natural gas is clean, affordable. We're seeing it supplement domestic gas resources around the world. We're seeing it provide support for renewables and supporting electrification. So we think LNG will play a critical role and particularly, American LNG in the global energy transition. Jeremy Tonet : Maybe pivoting a bit here, talking about RNG. I think you cite 20% RNG by 2030 here for your assets. And I was just wondering what line of sight that you might have to that number? And are there supporting policies or regulatory incentives that would need to be put in place to hit this or just kind of any other thoughts on the trajectory of the path there would be helpful? Jeff Martin : I'll make some comments and then ask if Kevin Sagara can supplement my views. But we've made some pretty bold commitments around going to Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions at net zero by 2045 in our gas utility. And many of you know, we own the largest gas utility here in North America, I think we've taken a leadership position in our commitments there. And to your point, we have made a commitment to be at 20% renewable natural gas by 2030. I think we're at about the 5% level today. And what's interesting is you get carbon offset credits if you can use renewable natural gas for marine purposes as well as for transportation purposes. And I think there's an opportunity to extend those type of offsets to pipeline utilization. We also think there's an opportunity here in California to see us move towards something that looks a lot more like the renewable portfolio standard that was used in 2007 to launch our renewable investments across the state. But we do think capturing biogas from landfill and from dairies has a huge impact on taking uncombusted methane out of the environment. So we're actually going to try to be a leader in that area. And this is something that we'd be even taking inquiries from some of our European partners about the progress and leadership that SoCalGas has shown. But Kevin, you want to comment on any of the regulatory issues or other issues around renewable natural gas? Kevin Sagara : Just as Jeff mentioned, we have a commitment at the gas company to have 5% of our core loads served by RNG by next year, and we're well on our way to meeting that. I think we're almost there right now. And then the larger commitment of 20% by 2030, I think for that one, we need some more regulatory incentives. Something like Jeff mentioned around an RPS standard would be very helpful ultimately. But this is an issue that we're going to have to tackle in the state. Methane is about 80 times, or you've seen maybe even more times worse, more times the net worse for the atmosphere and for the climate than CO2. And so there's going to be a need to be a regulatory construct in the end to drive kind of emitters of methane to capture that and use it or burn it, or put it back into the ground. So we're going to see more of that. But like you mentioned, I think an RPS standard will be very helpful in helping us reach our goal. Jeremy Tonet : Maybe just if I could squeeze the last one in with the Biden plan out there, early days. But just anything you see, I guess, that could help you on the transmission side or maybe aim any of your kind of growth in Texas or any thoughts there that you could share? Jeff Martin : No, I would just probably say that we're committed to work with this administration. Obviously, there's a little bit of a bid ask spread between both parties about the size of the infrastructure plan. But the area that there does seem to be a consensus beyond the normal bridges, roads and airports is around issues like telecom and number two, in expansion of the transmission system. So these are very, very hard to site and build. These are long lead time projects that can take up to a decade to complete. And it's one of the reasons I think that we feel so constructive about the transmission and distribution positions we have in Texas and California because we think the lion's share of these upgrades that will be extended will come from the existing owners of the existing rights way and existing land positions and infrastructure. So we've had a team on the ground in Washington led by Trevor and Lisa Alexander in the last two weeks, meeting with policymakers on this point. And I do think -- we expect to see some support in the infrastructure bill for transmission. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : A lot's been covered but I wanted to maybe go back to your investor event in June and just make sure I'm thinking about all the key focus topics. I heard a couple through Q&A like '22 guidance and a discussion of CapEx opportunities. But are there sort of other focused topics or sort of key messages you wanted to reinforce at that big event? Jeff Martin : No, I think we've had a fair amount of optimization in our portfolio over the last three years. And I think what we're going to try to accomplish at the analyst conference is make sure that we present a very clear runway of growth. You recall, one of the things that's new this year is that we've continued to make strides in reporting higher quality earnings, so we've backed out FX and mark to market and inflation from our results. You saw that in our recast comparison for last year. Secondly, you're going to hear us talk about the growth that we expect in our California and utility platforms in Texas and how we expect to fund that going forward. There will be a lot of focus, in Trevor's presentation in June, around our approach to funding our capital program. And I would also mention we expect Steve to have spotlights on technology and innovation in all of our business unit presentations. So it's very interesting. We had a conversation with Fatih Birol from the IEA not too long ago who met with our Board. And he made the point to us that for the world to reach net zero by 2050, it's the view of the International Energy Agency that 50% of the required technology, and that includes new fuels, do not exist today. So we think that industry controls the tools of decarbonization, and the research and development and innovation that's needed needs to come from industry. So you'll expect to hear us not just talk about sustainability but our role in taking a leadership position in our industry about what we're going to do in each business unit to improve sustainability and focus on innovation. Stephen Byrd : And maybe just on innovation and following up on the questions around California and natural gas. I mean, you all have been leaders in innovation in terms of thinking about renewable natural gas, how to pivot your business model to achieve a variety of goals. I was just curious, though, as you talk with the CPUC and talk with California legislators on the more negative end of the spectrum in terms of just any new developments that you see in terms of wanting, from a variety of folks, to move away from conventional methane more quickly or changes, pushes towards electrification. Anything else that you're sort of seeing in terms of your dialog with policymakers? Jeff Martin : I might ask Kevin to supplement these comments. But I would tell you that I think we benefited from positive and progressive regulation in the state for a long period of time. And there's no question that electrification will be a dominant near term and long term secular trend. But what's interesting to me is there's this growing convergence around the role of not just electric infrastructure but natural gas infrastructure because natural gas is what's allowing us to find that efficient frontier. I hosted a guest in our Center of Excellence here yesterday and we were looking at our real time board. And I think we were at right around 82% renewable penetration on SDG&E's system at a point in time yesterday afternoon. And that's only possible because you've made those investments in a resilient grid backed up by batteries, and you've got all the peaking and necessary load support from your natural gas side. So this was one of the lessons learned from our blackouts in California last summer. So I think there is this kind of convergence that over long periods of time to continue to push cleaner forms of energy, natural gas has a role, and we're still using a lot of natural gas, obviously, in power production. So there will always be points of differences. There will be robust dialogs. There will be conflict of discussions around energy policy. But over long periods of time, I think the state has done a great job. And you'll recall, in the most recent GRC, the PUC approved the largest capital spending program in the history of SoCalGas, and it's really a flexion of their commitment to safety and reliability and I think the long term importance of that system. And Kevin, would you like to make any more comments about natural gas generally in the state? Kevin Sagara : Yes, I'll just echo really what you said about, it's really clean electrons and clean molecules working in tandem. I think that's becoming clear as we progress on this continuum of the energy transition, Stephen. It's not really binary, it's not electrification and then forget about natural gas or forget about hydrogen, or forget about other clean forms of molecules. It's really some combination of both, because you can't really decarbonize the industrial sectors, the heavy duty transportation sectors without the clean molecules. And really, what you need to make the clean molecules is more renewable energy. You need more clean electrons, which means more investment in the transmission grids. And so it's really these two systems working together, which is going to result in achieving this net zero GHG emissions by 2045 goal that both the state has, but both of our utilities have announced their alignment with as well. So that's the key takeaway, I think. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : You brought up the very long term kind of share price and total return outperformance of Sempra over the last 20 years. And it's interesting, just curious, if I just look at a more recent, even though like over the last year, maybe even last two years relative to the main sector index, the shares have actually underperformed. And I'm just curious because you've made lots of great transactions to simplify the business and to monetize some of the valuable assets you own. Do you worry there's a need to diversify further away from California? Meaning do you worry and does the Board have a concern that California Utilities, whether it's due to wildfire risk, whether it's due to the move away from natural gas, whether it's earnings risk due to the cost of capital mechanism kicking in and low interest rates. Do you kind of worry that relative to the rest of the sector, that California Utilities are kind of, I guess, use the term discount stocks? Jeff Martin : Well, I would start by saying that -- and you've followed this for a long time, Michael, that we tend to take a long term view around how we try to create value. And we don't have knee jerk reactions to short term changes in the marketplace. And I know that's not what you're implying but we are always tying ourselves to that long term view. And you'll recall, I went back and looked, at the end of 2017, 88% of our earnings were North America and 12% were in South America, and we had roughly 70% of our earnings composition came from California. And today, that's just less than 50%. So there has been a trend in terms of how we've managed Sempra Infrastructure Partners and how we've managed our growth in Texas, namely through the acquisition of an 80% interest in Oncor. And then as you recall, we also bought InfraREIT, which was a public company. And then you've seen at Allen's capital program went from what was about $7.4 billion commitment in his November of 2017 for five year capital program to today is closer to $12.2 billion. So we're now forecasting $55 billion of utility rate base by the end of 2025 and at least based upon current returns is on a weighted ROE basis of about 10.1. But I think you're on a good point. We're going to continue to manage this portfolio and we're going to continue to grow at, number one, weighted toward utilities. And number two, if there's opportunities to expand, we have a huge leadership presence in California. We like the state. We think we have the chance to take some of the economies of learning here around sustainability, and that influences why we're a better stakeholder and investor in other parts of our business. Yes, we'll continue to look for opportunities to expand outside of California. And frankly, Mike, when you look back on the last three years, you've seen us execute that way. Michael Lapides : And then one follow up, kind of a more detailed one on LNG expansion and growth projects. Just curious, you've got, if I remember correctly, almost 7 million tons per year largely contracted at Port Arthur, the 5 million tons with Aramco and 2 million. How much more do you think you need take the project FID? Do you need the full [10 million] to take an FID, would you need something a little bit less than that to make it economic to do so? And do you think kind of the contracting market this year isn't robust enough just to get another 1 million or 2 million tons contracted? Jeff Martin : Well, I think what we try to do in our unregulated business is make sure that we exercise our capital allocation strategy to produce cash flows that have substantially similar risk reward to our utilities. So Port Arthur is an opportunity where we've got seven today. I don't see any scenario that we would probably take FID without having it fully contracted. I would mention, one of the things that was attractive, Michael, about the Sempra Infrastructure Partners portfolio is, you're hard pressed to find someone that owns a business like that, that has average contract tenure across LNG and our contracts in Mexico at 21 years. So all the lessons from last decade and the decade before about merchant positions and commodity exposure and exposure to generation, we paid our tuition back in those decades. And I think what we're focused on right now is aggressively growing our California and Texas utility platform. And inside of Sempra Infrastructure Partners, there's no question, we have an industry leading development platform. But we think that we have competitive positions that will allow us to fully contract those businesses before they go forward. And I'll make one last point. You may remember that we announced early on the MOUs, Michael, for ECA Phase 1 and that was fully tied up by MOUs before we progress to SPAs. We're in that exact same position today with Cameron expansion. So even though we're bullish long term about Port Arthur, that can be a remarkable project. We're even more bullish about Cameron expansion. So that's one that Justin and the team will be speaking more about at our analyst conference. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : A couple of questions. One, in terms of the SIP entity on a go forward basis, given your assets in Louisiana, curious if there's any efforts to develop hydrogen related infrastructure, specifically around your LA storage in Hackberry? Jeff Martin : I think we've talked about on prior calls, hydrogen is a very important development all across the Sempra family of companies. When we get to the analyst conference, Ryan, we would definitely have some spotlight discussions around our progress, both in our utilities and outside of our utilities on hydrogen. But perhaps I could turn it over to Justin to talk about as you think about creating more competitive projects, how are you thinking about hydrogen either at Port Arthur or Cameron? Justin Bird : I think we are looking at hydrogen opportunities at all of our LNG facilities, particularly those in the Gulf Coast. I think the other thing, and you mentioned Hackberry storage, the other thing that's interesting, Ryan, is we're also looking at carbon sequestration. So how can we not only take the carbon from our own liquefaction facilities, but is there a way to develop a facility that can take carbon from some of the adjacent industries in that area, whether they be LNG or other things to help reduce CO2 there. So I think we are very excited about these opportunities. We are thinking along the same lines as you, Ryan. And I think, as Jeff mentioned, when we talk about innovation at the Analyst Day, this is one of the areas that I think you'll see us focus on. Ryan Levine : Maybe switching gears, as COVID related restrictions continue to ease, how are you expecting O&M costs to trend in the back half of the year? And are there any meaningful opportunities you have to reduce some of your overall costs across the businesses? Jeff Martin : It's interesting because of our geographic exposure to Mexico, obviously, Texas, here in California and Louisiana, you can imagine, Ryan, that each jurisdiction has been a little bit impacted differently. We've been a little bit further behind in California. For example, we have not even begun to have or authorized discretionary business travel. We also have not really had a return to the office program across Sempra yet. So we're still working more in a virtual mode, except for our central workforce, which is in the field. But things that we're looking at, you may recall, over the last three years, we've had these programs we call the Janus program, where we try to take costs, particularly out of the parent company. We've had a consistent process in '18, '19 and '20 of reducing costs at the parent company. At our California utilities, they're also being thought. But one area that we're going to track well into the future, Ryan, is our real estate needs. We have a lot of office space, storage facilities all across Southern California. I know Allen has looked at this in Texas. And once we get back to a more normalized return to work profile, I think this will be an opportunity to look at our fleet vehicle program. We'll look at our real estate costs. All these also impact our ongoing O&M, entertainment and travel costs as well. And Trevor, would you like to add anything to that in terms of how you're thinking about it? Trevor Mihalik : Ryan, I would just point you to the appendix where we kind of lay out where we had lower parent costs, and that was really $15 million of lower operating costs at the parent. So you can see where we're looking to try to find efficiencies across the board and hope to continue to do so. Ryan Levine : And last question for me. In terms of the federal legislation that's being discussed in Washington, you highlighted additional investment opportunity around transmission. Curious your view around the necessary permits there to be able to execute on some of those opportunities. And if there's any assistance or policy that may be supportive of facilitating that further transmission method. Jeff Martin : I think it's one of the things that's kind of plagued kind of the policy environment about how you address issues like this. You've obviously seen it in the pipeline industry as well. But particularly because transmission and pipelines involve interstate commerce, that's one of the reasons that the federal government has such an important role here in terms of policy making. But a lot of those land and those rights issues fall to the state. So I think this is something they're going to continue to grapple with. We found no silver bullet in the last couple of decades in this area. What I would say is the ability to develop, whether it's generation spurs, 230 kV lines, 500 kV lines, it's a little bit different by jurisdiction, whether you're in Louisiana, or you're in Texas or Mexico relative to California. You may remember the last large scale transmission line we built here was the Sunrise power line, and it took up almost $1.9 billion to build 90 miles. So it is a very costly, challenging permitting project, particularly in California. And that's one of the reasons, Ryan, that we have a thesis that when you talk about transmission and distribution and the importance of grids towards accepting more renewables, it will fall largely to upgrading existing facilities and making sure that more renewable clusters can access existing infrastructure. Operator : We'll go next to Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : If I could follow up on Michael's question earlier. I mean, the company makes a compelling argument for the growth of the Sempra\u2019s LNG platform and also the diversification of utility earnings from California. Recently, we have seen really high multiples on LDC transactions, similar to what CenterPoint has just announced and also maybe a transaction like Duke selling a slice of its Indiana utility. Is that something Sempra would consider selling a portion of its regulated utilities as a low source of capital or cost of capital to either fund LNG expansion, or organic or inorganic utility expansion? Jeff Martin : I appreciate the question. We spend a lot of time thinking of opportunities to continue to improve our portfolio. We certainly wouldn't take any option off the table. But I would call your attention to the fact that if we're trading at 16 or 17 times now, we just announced the transaction a couple of weeks ago at a 21 PE effectively. So raising $3.37 billion at something close to a 13 to 13.4 times EBITDA and 21 PE, that was the cheapest source of capital for us to fund our $32 billion capital program. So I can guarantee that we will be thoughtful in this area. But right now, we have a tremendous amount of growth in front of our utility platform in California and in Texas. And right now, our focus is on making sure we can meet our organic capital program with the lowest cost forms of capital and we'll provide updates as we go forward. Anthony Crowdell : And then just lastly to that, I mean, what limits the growth? It seems that as you highlighted, the company has done a great job of sourcing capital, finding projects. What limits that growth? Is it bill intact, is it finding more projects? Just because it looks like the company is hitting on all cylinders, whether it's sourcing capital. You talked about how Allen's projected CapEx has just really hockey sticked up since 2017. Just what are the limitations there? Jeff Martin : Well, I think the most important thing is that you align your capital programs with the regulatory priorities of your local commission. So here in California, there's a big emphasis around safety and resiliency, and reliability. In Texas, Allen's challenge is a little bit more different. He's got really enormous growth challenges in terms of making infrastructure investments to accommodate growth. I participated in the Board call with Allen and Trevor recently at Oncor. And in the far west region, they saw something close to 5% to 5.3% quarter-over-quarter electricity growth. So I think the challenge will be different by jurisdiction. I would say this, one thing that intrigues us is, we spend a lot of time not just investing in our high performing culture but building a business system that allows us to effectively manage our businesses, manage risk effectively, invest in our culture and be good allocators of capital. And I think we have the real opportunity to build a bigger platform of scale. I think it was one of the outcomes from the pandemic last year was this belief that it's important to be larger and a market leader in every market. So when you think about our position in California, you think about our position with Allen's business in Texas and you think about Sempra Infrastructure Partner, we've added scale at all three of those growth platforms. And what we want to do is continue to assert those advantages in those markets to meet the needs of our regulators and our customers. And I think we'll find opportunities around that along the way, but we feel very good about how our business and our portfolio is set up, we believe, to provide differential growth around the dividend and earnings going forward. Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Arnold with Vertical. Jonathan Arnold : Just a couple of quick ones. And I apologize if I missed this earlier, but do you anticipate starting to report SIP as an entity anytime soon or guiding to EBITDA reporting that, or do we stay sort of within the current reporting segments and earnings focus as the main currency? Jeff Martin : Well, I would tell you that we've spent time talking about this. You've heard us on this call talk about our three growth platforms. And perhaps, Trevor, you could talk about the process we've put in place going forward as we think about our segments and also our focus on EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA going forward. Trevor Mihalik : So Jonathan, as you've seen, we do have this platform that is the combination of two businesses. At some point, I think we would like to get to Sempra Infrastructure Partners as a segment. That probably would not happen on an interim basis during the quarter, we would do it on an annual basis when we get to an end of a year period. Right now, I think there is an overlap between Mexico, given the LNG assets that they have in Mexico and the LNG business. But as we're putting this together and working through the structure, both internally here and as with KKR, we will be making that determination as to what the reportable segments would be on a prospective basis. Jeff Martin : And I would also follow on that, Jonathan, to say that we will be expecting to report adjusted EBITDA for Sempra Infrastructure. Jonathan Arnold : So you'll start that, but the segments may come later perhaps? Trevor Mihalik : That's right. I think you can see, at least until we get the transaction closing through a period, we will still be reporting on the Mexican business and the LNG business. But then as we put the management team in place and as we manage that business prospectively, it would be managed as a single unit then at some point in the future. Jonathan Arnold : And then just one other thing, like when you announced the SIP stake sale in the 8-K, you talked about these priority distribution rights that KKR was getting based on deviations on project cash flows. And I think there was something in there, too, about a priority distribution if SIP did not take FID on certain projects by a certain time. Just any incremental insight you can give us to materiality and what these sort of time frames and projects would be. Jeff Martin : What I would say is that we want to make sure that we're transparent in all those 8-K filings. We obviously have done a great amount of work about how we structure these partnerships. And it's not uncommon to have different distributions around different issues within a business or member loans. I would tell you, from our perspective, we do not view these as rising to any level of materiality in terms of the overall business. So I would say, I would characterize them as ordinary course and adequately disclosed based on how we think about it. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Jeff Martin for additional or closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Yes. I just wanted to close by thanking everyone for attending. I know there was a lot of other calls today so we appreciate you spending time with the Sempra team. We also look forward to providing you with further updates at our upcoming Virtual 2021 Investor Day, which we expect to be held on June 29th. So please take a moment at the end of today's call just to mark that date on your calendar. It's something we always look forward to. Thank you again for joining us and feel free to reach out to our IR team with any additional questions per custom. This concludes today's call. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Nelly Molina. Please go ahead. Nelly Molina : Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our Second Quarter 2021 Earnings call for Sempra. A live webcast of this teleconference and this live presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.  On the line with us today, we have several members of our management team, including Jeff Martin, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra LNG; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Kevin Sagara, Group President; and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.  Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. All of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Please refer to the presentation of slides that accompany this call for a recompilation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today over the 5th 2021, and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.  With that, please, turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Nelly. I want to start today by thanking those that attended our virtual Investor Day this past June, and also mention that the team and I really enjoyed getting back on the road this past month and seeing many of you in person.  As we discussed at our Investor Day, we've simplified our business model, narrowed our investment strategy to attractive markets, and improved Capital discipline, all with the goal of offering a competitive value proposition, including consistent and attractive returns, strong Earnings visibility and EPS growth, and a sustainable and growing dividend.  Additionally, at the Investor Day, Allen and I highlighted the robust growth that Oncor continues to see all across its service territory. And as a result, Oncor is increasing its capital plan, which Trevor describes in further detail later in today's presentation. Shifting now to the quarter, I'm pleased with our financial results, and I think it's a testament to the affirmative steps we've taken to simplify our business model and focus our capital investments on top-tier infrastructure growth platforms. We're reporting strong earnings and affirming both our increased 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range and our 2022 EPS guidance range.  I'm excited about the progress we've made so far this year, and I'm proud of the broad support we're seeing all across our operating businesses. Now, please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide both business and financial updates. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. To begin, we have had several positive developments at our operating companies this past quarter. At SDG&E in July, we received CPUC approval for our 2021 Wildfire Mitigation Plan Update, building on the utility\u2019s long-standing commitment to advance fire hardening and public safety. SoCalGas began flowing renewable natural gas at two additional biomethane projects in support of their goal to provide 20% RNG to core customers by 2030 to help the state reach its de-carbonization goals.  In Texas, Oncor has provided visibility to their 2022 to 2026 projected Capital plan, which has increased to approximately $14 billion over the five-year period. Additionally, Oncor did receive PUCT approval to extend its rate case filing deadline to June 1, 2022. At Sempra Infrastructure, we completed the exchange offer for IEnova's shares, resulting in a 96.4% ownership interest, and we plan to launch a cash tender offer for the remaining 3.6% interest. We're also advancing the sale of the non-controlling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to KKR.  And while I may have been a bit optimistic at Investor Day, we now expect to close the transaction around the end of the Third Quarter subject to the Mexican Competition Commission completing its economic and market analysis and issuing the regulatory approval.  With that, please turn to the next slide for more details around Oncor's capital plan update. Oncor continues to operate in one of the fastest-growing states with strong macro fundamentals. As a result, Oncor is announcing its 2022 to 2026 projected capital plan of approximately $14 billion, nearly a $2 billion increase over the 2021 to 2025 capital plan. Furthermore, Oncor is increasing its 2021 to 2022 Capital plan by approximately $425 million, consistent with what Allen outlined at the Investor Day and is largely incorporated in the new $14 billion five-year capital plan.  Oncor's robust Capital plan supports the economic development seen throughout its service territory, increases in generation interconnection requests, strong premise growth, and investments in grid resiliency.  A good example of this robust growth can be seen in new relocations, expansions, and electric service to Oncor system, which are on pace to exceed 2020 values by 70% and to exceed 2019 values by 170%. Please turn to the next slide where I will review the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported Second Quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $424 million or $1.37 per share. This compares to Second Quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.239 billion or $7.61 per share.  On an adjusted basis, Second Quarter 2021 earnings were $504 million or $1.63 per share. This compares to our Second Quarter of 2020 adjusted earnings of $501 million or $1.71 per share.  On a year-to-date basis, 2021 GAAP earnings were $1.298 billion or $4.24 per share. This compares to year-to-date 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.999 billion or $9.91 per share.  Adjusted year-to-date 2021 Earnings were $1.404 billion or $4.58 per share. This compares to our year-to-date 2020 adjusted Earnings of $1.242 billion or $4.20 per share. Please turn to the next slide.  The variance in the Second Quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items : $126 million from a CPUC decision that resulted in the release of a regulatory liability at the California utilities in 2020 related to prior year\u2019s forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account, and $22 million of lower earnings due to the sale of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020 respectively. This was more than offset by $38 million higher equity earnings from the Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase 1 achieving full commercial operations in August of 2020. $35 million of lower losses at Parents and Other, primarily due to lower preferred dividends and lower net interest expense, $34 million of higher income tax benefits from forecasted flow-through items at SDG&E and SoCalGas, and $22 million income tax benefit in 2021 from the re-measurement of certain deferred income taxes at Sempra LNG.  Please turn to the next slide. We are pleased with our strong operational and financial performance this quarter and are focused on continuing to execute throughout the remainder of the year. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Now, I will stop, and we can take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone to signal they have a question. Thank you. We'll now take the first question from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hi, everyone. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Jeff, could you maybe just talk a little bit about the visibility into '22? I mean, you obviously -- you and Trevor reiterated guidance. There is more Capex coming into Texas, which includes some contemporary instrument recovery. Can you maybe talk about the other moving pieces or changes in assumptions for '22, i.e., maybe cost of Capital, anything else that could move you in the range or actually incremental to the range? Jeff Martin : Right I would start Shar by indicating that we're very pleased with our first half results. To be able to produce $4.58 of adjusted EPS from the first half, I think is an extraordinary outcome. And that does cause us to be fairly bullish against our increased guidance for 2021, and we certainly think there will be some pull-through of that strength into 2022. And I think it's a function of the growth that we're seeing in front of all three platforms. I think there's a portfolio of opportunities here in California and in Texas in the Sempra Infrastructure, which really highlights why we need to perform and execute well. I could not be more pleased. We obviously did this transaction back in March 2018 with Oncor. We forecasted internally with our Board that there would be increased capital opportunities. We were pleased at the time that they had a $7.4 billion commitment to their regulator, about their capital program. In November 2017, they launched a great CIS program. What we were not prepared for was the quality of that management team. So, Allen Nye is on the call with today Don Clevenger, who is the CFO; Matt Henry, the General Counsel; and Jim Greer, the COO. They are knocking the socks off of it by prioritizing what we think is most important at Sempra, which is strength of operations and safety. More to your point on what we can expect next year, you did raise cost of Capital. We talked a little bit about that at the analyst conference. And in our assumptions for 2022, we indicated that we did not expect in those assumptions to include any type of triggering at SDG&E or SoCalGas, though we did mention, Shar, that there is a trigger to occur which looks more likely now, it would probably be limited only to SDG&E and within the confines of that business, Kevin Sagara and his team thinks that they can limit the impact to that forward guidance to roughly $0.05 to $0.10 cents. So, I would just summarize by saying the first half of this year causes great optimism for our performance even against the increased guidance we provided for this year. I will be disappointed if we're not back in front of our investors taking an increased view of what our performance might be in 2021. We do expect some of that pull-through to continue into 2022. We're obviously not prepared to revise the guidance for 2022 yet largely because this cost of capital mechanism is still out there. But we think at least at SDG&E, it's well managed to something around $0.05 to $0.10 of impact. Shar Pourreza : Perfect, I think that message is pretty clear. Thank you for that, Jeff. And then, just on -- I mean, you set a clean path on LNG at the Analyst Day. Since then, some contracts have been moved over from Port Arthur. Do you anticipate Cameron Train 4 is now close to being fully subscribed between existing MOUs and the Polish Oil? And as a follow-up, can you characterize if the economics of Cameron 4 are better than Port Arthur? And is there a way to make Port Arthur more competitive to potentially get the off-take interest back to that site? Thank you. Jeff Martin : Sure. Let me take a step back and take a little broader view, and I'll come right back to your question. We talked a little bit at Investor Day about our focus right now is on making sure that ECA Phase 1 is delivered on time and on budget. We have that coming into our planning period in the second half of 2024, and that's proceeding quite well. We've been managing the COVID environment down there and the work environment, and we remain optimistic about continuing to meet that deadline. Secondly, I think we have been consistent, really, over the last 18 months about continuing to have a more bullish view on Cameron Expansion. We're working closely with Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Total. We will be continuing to have those conversations throughout the fall. We do think that project will have superior returns, which is one of the questions you are indicating. And that's largely because at a high level, you can always expect the economics of Brownfield Projects to be generally superior to Greenfield Projects. And the key for Greenfield Projects like Port Arthur is it's much more advantageous to do that project at multiple phases at scale, which makes it increasingly more economic. But right now, bringing online Train 4 at Cameron is a top priority for Justin and Faisel on the team. And being able to do that, Shar, at the same time that you debottleneck trains 1, 2, and 3, really adds to its cost advantage. And you mentioned Port Arthur; that continues to be a remarkably well-situated site. The team is going to ground right now to make it more competitive, and we've outlined some of the steps we're taking to reduce the emissions profile. And I think the recent announcement regarding the Polish Oil & Gas Company, really is a reflection of the strength number one of that customer relationship, and their confidence in our ability to deliver them into a project that meets their long-term needs. So, I think that relationship is in good stead. I certainly think ECA 1 is going well. We continue to be quite bullish on Cameron Expansion, and Port Arthur is probably a longer-term opportunity, but we have more work to be done there. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. That's very clear. Thanks so much, Jeff. Congrats. Jeff Martin : Thanks. Thanks, Shar. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for having me here. Just want to start off if you might be able to talk a bit about timing considerations that went into the choice to raising Oncor Capex now versus at the Analyst Day or waiting until 3Q? And then could you help us think through what some of the limitations might be to add even more Capital just given all the opportunities down there in Texas? Jeff Martin : Well, I think there's a series of questions there, and let me try to take them seriatim; and then Allen, I'll pass it to you to provide some more color, but let me just start with a couple of highlight points. Number one, Jeremy, the growth that we're talking about and the adjustments to the capital program are really around, number 1, strong premise growth; number 2, active transmission interconnection requests, primarily focused on renewables and some baseload generation, and new T&D investments. In terms of the timing around revising our plan, we had a Board meeting with Oncor last week. Allen is very good about bringing back to the Board not only the approval of next year's plan for 2022, but taken the opportunity to review longer-term what the opportunity really was to meet some of the growth needs in Texas. We feel quite bullish about that opportunity. I would add one final comment. We've seen some questions earlier this morning, but the raised expectation that Allen's team has put forward -- they've also got a press release out that provides more detail -- does not impact the continued expectation of incremental Capital in the $775 million range to 1.27 billion. We've had the opportunity to reevaluate the needs of that business and the needs of our customers over the next 5 years. We'll go into the fall planning cycle with the view toward updating our Board in October -- in November, but I thought the opportunity here was really one of providing our latest view as transparently as possible to the street. Allen, I know covered a number of these points, but I think if you don't mind, talk a little bit more detail about the growth that you're seeing across your system and maybe your approach to governance with your Board last week. Allen Nye : Yeah, thanks, Jeff, and thanks, Jeremy. I think Jeff covered it to a large degree, but let me just give you a little bit of color. With regards to why now, it's exactly what Jeff said. You know why? I mentioned at the Investor Day that we had a need to go to our board in July to increase our expectations for 2022 in order to get ahead of the game to make sure we have the resources and the equipment to actually execute next year. And so as Jeff said, we did that, we raised 22 from what we previously said was 2.4 to 2.5, up to 2.8. We also took this opportunity to let you all know that we are seeing some opportunities this year and so we've upped our 2021 from 2.4, which is what we previously had told you all, to 2.5. And then just given the fact that we're going to go ahead, and talking about increasing '21 and '22, we had the opportunity to discuss with our board. Thanks for seeing some of this growth that Jeff is talking about. And so we've been spending a lot of time on Capex here at Oncor because of what we're seeing. And what we're seeing is, to Jeff's point, and Trevor talked about it earlier, premise growth last year, we had the largest organic growth rate ever in our Company 's history. And we're on pace this year through two quarters. Both quarters this year were higher than the corresponding quarters last quarter -- last year. Transmission points of interconnection on both the retail and the generation side are above the levels end-of-year last year and above the similar quarters of last year. Economic development, which I think is in Trevor's earlier remarks -- economic development is another thing we look at. Requests for information which are basically project location-specific discussions we're having with potential builders are up 72% approximately year-over-year. And then always talk about West Texas when we're talking about growth. The West Texas story continues to be really strong. The latest trend is electrification of fields, people considering ESG ramifications, emissions. So we're getting some uptick there, but we have another peak on our Culberson Loop transmission system in July. It hit 760 megawatts versus 678 last year. That's an all-time high. Another peak in the Far West Texas weather zone in June. So we're seeing growth all over our system, really strong, which leads to these Capex discussions we're having. And since I told you all at the Investor Call, our investor meeting, that we're going to address '22 with our board in July. And since we've adjusted '21 up, we thought now is a good opportunity to just provide you all with our expectations of the management team of what we're seeing with regards to those outer years. And those outer years, as you can see in our documents are, we're looking at 2.7 to 3.0 for the 4 years of the -- outer years of the plan. And that's our expectation right now. But as Jeff said, we're going to go into October like we always do, and have our meeting on our 5-year plan with our shareholders, with our independent directors, and with our board. And we're going to review the information available to us at that time, and we'll have a number then. It may be 14, it may be something else, so we feel very good about 14 right now. And we'll see where we are when we get to October, and we'll have something to announce after that. To Jeff's point as well, we added about 1.8 billion to our 5-year expectation right now. The incremental capital that we have talked about in previous meetings and investor calls in the range of 775 to 1,275, which I think is on page 45 of the Investor Day the last time we talked. That remains available. We have -- sometimes, new projects from that incremental bucket into our Capex plans. Sometimes, we have Capex that comes from outside that incremental bucket, and it goes into our plan. But notwithstanding the fact that we've raised to, right now, our expectation to around 14 billion over 5. They are significant, they remain significant opportunities to invest on our system. And those additional opportunities are in part reflected in that incremental Capex bucket that we've discussed before. I'd be glad to answer any questions, but thanks a lot. Jeff Martin : I would just mention that I appreciate that color, Allen. And for your benefit, Jeremy, remember we as a management team and our Board of Directors underwrote a transaction in the fall of 2017 and we closed it March of 2018, based on the belief that they had made a regulatory commitment to spend roughly $7.4 billion over five years, or roughly $1.48 billion a year on average. And now we're outlining something that looks like on the back end of the plan, that could be looking more like $3 billion a year. That's an almost doubling of the average output in terms of Capex at that Company, so we're very pleased with the growth in the state. And I think Allen and his team have a great plan to meet that growth in a way which is the most cost-effective for ratepayers. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That was very helpful. Thank you for the thorough answer there. Maybe if I could just pivot to RNG here, if that's okay. Just want to see if you could provide some color on how California customer demand for RNG has been trending over time. And do you see any kind of policy or regulatory items that you're watching that could support the 20% goal for 2030? And then maybe, even though RNG has negative carbon attributes, how do you see competing for customers versus the electrification? Do you see customers choosing one path or the other? Jeff Martin : Look, I think if we're going to meet our long-term climate goals as a nation, we need on all the above strategy. Electrification is going to be a long-term secular trend. We certainly have the opportunity to play that in a big way, just as Allen described. In Texas, we expect to be a leader in that market in connecting renewable grid solutions to our -- to load centers. Here in California, we did something that no one else has done across this country. We made a commitment that we would deliver roughly 20% of all of the natural gas delivered on the SoCalGas system, not 2030 using renewable natural gas. You may have seen the press release in the last week or so. We just connected 2 new biomethane plants to our systems. So whether it's a transportation opportunity, whether it's a maritime opportunity, or an opportunity to basically deliver renewable natural gas across our network; it's a priority. We have set a goal of being at the 5% level next year. We remain on track to hit that goal. Scott Drew and his team are doing a hell of a job at SoCalGas to transform that business. And by doing so, as you know, exogenous methane in environment has an 80 times higher detriment than gas which is combusted in the ordinary course. And there has been some exciting developments in terms of how the Commission and the other stakeholders in the state view RNG. I thought maybe Kevin Sagara as our Group President for California could talk about the recent report that came out of the PUC regarding this. Kevin Sagara : Yeah, I think -- Thank you, Jeremy, for that question. And yeah, as you might expect, we've had a great run so far with the low carbon fuel standard in this state creating a good amount of demand for RNG buttering through to go to the next level and help meet the state's very ambitious climate goals. We saw that the legislature passed SB-1440. And then recently the PUC staff -- this PUC energy division issued a staff report recommending, essentially an RPS for RNG for the California Utilities. And really, the levels are based on the California statutory obligation to divert organic waste from landfills. So when you look out to 2025, they're supposed to procure the utilities -- are supposed to procure biomethane from organic at least equal to about 75% of the state's obligation to divert this wastes from landfills, which is about 5.5% of core load. To my 2030, that goes up to about 12.3% of core load. You asked about creating more demand, that would be a good opportunity. That stack of work hasn't yet been active on, but we are hopeful it does shortly. Jeff Martin : That's why I think we are glad you asked the question because it really is a priority to our Company. And I think that Scott Drew and the team continue to innovate at SoCalGas. We have opportunity to be a leader in RNG. We've also made some commitments, as you've seen Jeremy, to be a leader in hydrogen. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Super helpful. If I could slip in one last quick one here, just given some of the resource adequacy concerns that have come up this summer in California, what's your latest thinking on some of the Capital opportunities that might present themselves here? Jeff Martin : Yes. This is a great opportunity to go back and talk about our base business model. We're a T&D Company. So one of the things that has privileged our commitment to California and our commitment to Texas is we've moved away from being an owner and operator of electric generation, either fossil or renewable, with exception of Mexico. And likewise, we don't have a lot of exposure because we're decoupled on whether consumers consume more or less, so we very much like that sweet spot of building that long-term growing bond Portfolio and not being exposed to those issues. In terms of Capital opportunities, there has been a new announcement in the state where they're looking for 11.5 gigawatts of new capacity additions in terms of generation, energy efficiency, and long-duration storage. And we certainly think long-duration storage in particular is a unique opportunity where we've developed a capability there at San Diego Gas Electric, and that will be a continued opportunity. But in the near term, the state is really being aggressive about making sure we find more needs -- more ways of supporting our resource adequacy. And I think one of the great challenges, Jeremy, is traditionally during some of the highest demand times of the year, we're importing about 25% of the state's power needs from outside of California and it always makes us subject to what's taken place in those other jurisdictions and what their demand needs are. Over a long period of time, California's got to take steps, and it could take 5 to 7 years to get ahead of these demand needs through new capacity additions. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Makes sense. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Jeff Martin : Appreciate you joining the call. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Durgesh Chopra at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jeff Martin : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Jeff. Thank you for taking my question. I have a -- Jeff Martin : No worries. Durgesh Chopra : I have a clarification and then a follow-up question. Just -- I know you've talked about Oncor at gun, but just -- so the '21 to '25 Capex as it sits now, is it closer to 12.6 billion, 12.7 billion with the 400 million incremental. Is that the right way to think about it or is it still at 12.2? Jeff Martin : That's the right way to think about it. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just on SIP getting to the close here. Is -- you have a cash tender offer for the balance of like 4% that you currently don't own for Mexico. Do you have to get to a 100% to close SIP? I'm just thinking about what the -- is it more so a procedural delay in the SIP or does the Mexico -- like owning a 100% of the Mexico needs to get you to take that box before completing that transaction with KKR? Jeff Martin : Yeah, I would think about it as two different disjunctive ideas here. Number 1, our long-term goal is to take the IEnova business platform private. As you've indicated, we -- there is still about 3.6%, which is floated to public investors. And the process that we're following is to set up a cash tender process, which will happen over the next week or two with a view toward taking out that additional pri -- public float and delisting that business. If there's any remaining shares, we'll look to clean that up by a separate mechanism. In terms of closing, that's not really the pacing item for closing. The pacing item for closing is there's a small number of CPs related to regulatory approvals, and right now we think the pacing item is the Competition Commission in Mexico. And once they finished their analysis, we think we will be in a position to close the transaction, which we're forecasting is around the end of Q3. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you, guys. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot for joining us. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Just curious. Jeff Martin : Hi, Mike. Michael Lapides : Hi, Jeff. Commodity inputs are up a ton. How are you thinking about what this means for the construction cost per ton of any new LNG trains, whether it's Cameron 4 or somewhere else, that haven't already gone FID and don't have the lump-sum contracts? And therefore, what that means really for the economics of North American LNG versus LNG coming from other sources around the world? Jeff Martin : Right. So, look, I think you're asking a great question. I think input cost to all infrastructure businesses are being impacted. You're also seeing it in other commodity costs as well. We probably have a multi-pronged strategy here. I would tell you at ECA Phase 1 obviously we've got an EPC wrapped contract. We feel good about the contract at ECA, but that would be a near-term focus for us. In terms of input costs for future projects, that goes through our whole feed and pre-feed process to make sure we get to the right number. But I think it does go back to this issue, Michael, that Greenfield Projects which tend to have a little bit of a higher per-unit costs in Brownfield Projects. This will continue to put pressure on that dichotomy. But keep in mind that all the other projects in the world are subject to those same cost pressures. At the same time that you're seeing cost pressures around construction, you're still seeing a lot higher LNG stock prices around the world. And most people who are observing this industry think it will be the most dominant fuel used in the world by the early part of next decade. And the only way that's going to occur is, is you are going to see a massive build-out of continued LNG development, and U.S. should expect to take its fair share. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jeff. Much appreciated. Hey, one for Allen. Just curious. What's the latest on being able to push out the rate case? And I guess a follow-on with the higher Capex budget, how do you think about what that means for regulatory lag? Allen Nye : Yeah, you bet Michael. The answer is yes. We received approval on July 29 by the Public Utility Commission to move our rate case filing deadline to 06/01/2022 of next year. So we're off the calendar for this year, and we're on the clock for 06/01/2022. Second question with regard to lag, and was lag associated with this additional investment; is that right? Michael Lapides : Yeah, just -- if you raise Capex, do you -- does that also -- I know the trackers for distribution and transmission could capture much of that. But just curious about the forward versus historical-looking nature of those trackers, as well as what happens to other parts of the income statement that could drive regulatory lag? Allen Nye : Let me answer this way. 97 -- approximately 97% of everything in this plan that we have now, the 5-year plan, is tracker eligible. And those trackers -- as we talked about for the trackers decreased the lag on the transmission side, the interim key cost tracker decreases lag to about 5 months, approximately. While the distribution cost tracker, while it's good, is not quite as efficient and the lag on the distribution side is about 15 months. So about 97% of everything we've talked about this morning, that's a net 14 billion over five, the lag associated with that investment was generally consistent with these two periods of time that I've just described. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Allen. Much appreciated. Allen Nye : Yes, sir. Thank you. Jeff Martin : And I would just mention the following for the audiences that volume growth, which they are experiencing in Texas can also offset some of that lag in the regulatory model. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Sophie Karp at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sangeeta: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. It's actually Sangeeta for Sophie. Jeff Martin : What's the question? Trevor Mihalik : She's [Indiscernible] for Sophie. Sangeeta: Just a couple follow-ups on the Texas Capex. Should we think of inflation as being any factor in the increase in the front-end of the Capex? And then, as a follow-up, my question is, does the recent Texas legislation build into your Capex at any point or do you see upside from that? Jeff Martin : So what I would try to do is I'll answer the first part of the question and pass it onto you, Allen, for the legislative question. But the way to think about it Sophie is that, Allen and his team, particularly Jim Greer, deserve a lot of credit because as they've been looking at meeting the needs for 2021 and planning to meet both the hard costs and soft costs needs for 2022. This is one of the reasons that the timing of these conversations with the board was moved forward. In other words, there are some inflationary and competitive pressures to access the equipment and materials they need to meet their growth needs in the state. And they deserve a lot of credit for being proactive to go ahead and secure and lap those resources well in advance. But I don't think beyond that it's had any influence in terms of how we're thinking about the recast over 5 years. But Allen, maybe you could talk about the various builds are continuing to -- our pending in the legislature and how you might think about forward Capex related to those bills. Allen Nye : Yes, thanks, Jeff. I agree with that, the answer on the inflation. And with regards to legislation, there's 2 things to think about here. There's what was passed and has been signed by the Governor in the regular session, which has now to large degree, been shifted over to the PUC and to ERCOT. There's over 30 Rulemakings presently going on at the Public Utility Commission that's basically going to set out how this legislation is going to be implemented. And then there are a number of bills that have been filed right now in special session. So I'll address it this way. Special session, the governor did not include electric issues in the charge and -- in the call rather and the call is what limits the topics that can be addressed by the legislature. So we're monitoring what's going on with the legislature with these bills that relate to the electric industry, but we don't believe they're going anywhere without the charge or the call being changed, which we don't anticipate happening. Our focus really is more on the activities of the PUC where the rulemakings are going on. I talked about this, I think during the Investor call, there are quite a few bills, a bunch of rulemakings, a lot of them have to do with PUC ERCOT issues, there is some coordination between agencies and industry participants, and then there's some general costs for weatherization and things like that. We'll have to see, it's too early to predict, what's going to come out of those rulemakings. They are just at the beginning. But to the extent anything comes out of that, that would be incremental to what we have in our Capex plan right now. The other thing that I mentioned in the investor call, there was another bill that was not related to winter storm Uri, but it added an economics benefit test to the transmission approval process at ERCOT. And we think that has the potential to potentially allow us to get more projects, economic projects through ERCOT, but again, we'll have to wait and see how that all shakes out before we'll know for sure. That's my answer. Thanks. Jeff Martin : And Sangeeta, I just want to make sure we answered both of your questions. Did that answer for you? Sangeeta: Yes. Yes, if I can just add a follow-up, I share a different question. Now that we know that the Texas GRC is pushed to 2022 and otherwise their regulatory calendar kind of looks light through the end of the year, how would you characterize the Puts and Takes that could lead you to the high end of your 2021 guidance versus the low-end? Jeff Martin : Well, I would just make a couple of comments. One was the movement of the Texas rate case was assumed in our planning numbers that we provided at the Investor Day. I made some comments earlier on this call that I could not be more pleased with the strength of our financial performance in the first 6 months to be able to post $4.58 of Adjusted EPS. I think that really bodes well for the second half of this year. And I do expect, Sangeeta, some pull-through into 2022. And I mentioned one of the offsetting considerations was the cost of capital we talked about earlier. Sangeeta: Right. Okay. That answers my questions. Thanks so much. Jeff Martin : Wonderful. Thank you for joining us. Operator : We'll now take the next question from James Thalacker at BMO Capital Markets. Please, go ahead. Jeff Martin : Good morning. James, you may be on mute. James Thalacker : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the call. Jeff Martin : Good morning. James Thalacker : This might be a question for Allen. And I'm not putting the cart before the horse, but traditionally, T&D companies in Texas, have been viewed as a smaller risk, and the capital structures have reflected this. Over the last couple of years, we've obviously seen with the impact of the area and increased hurricane risk, and now we've got a new PUCT coming in. Has there been any discussion potentially about thinking the equity layer as the one way to beef up the credit in anticipation of maybe more widespread system hardening? Jeff Martin : And Allen, I'll make a quick comment and turn it over to you, and I appreciate that question. I would just make one comment, which is, we as a management team have spent a lot of time in the last 3 years really trying to distinguish what we think is a unique benefit of T&D investments relative to other businesses that are either weather-exposed or consumer volume exposed or exposed to stranded cost risk with generation. So as you think about in California, the blackouts that happened last summer, you think about how we operated through the pandemic here in California and in Texas, and you think about Storm Uri, which you referenced. All we've really done is raise our guidance and exceed our guidance. This is the strength of having a T&D model that we think gives us unique visibility to consistent financial performance. So I just want to make that point because we talk very consistently about the value of the model that we're pursuing and why we think it deserves a higher valuation, and I think it really is very much true with the T&D business in Texas. Allen, feel free to go ahead and add some additional color around how you think about your equity layer. Allen Nye : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jeff. I agree. Look, I think our equity layer is lower than, maybe the national average. Things that are going on in other parts of the country. It's something we always look at when we're putting together a rate case. We're probably about, even with CenterPoint API right now. But now, we've got a little time going into June of next year. Some will spend a lot of time on, figure out what we can accomplish. We have a long, long history, as I've said many times on these calls, of working with the -- all the constituents in our cases. And that was demonstrated again by the support we got for looking this rate case off. And we'll see what we can accomplish, yeah. Uri, things like that, certainly impact our thoughts and our analysis, and -- but yeah, maybe cart -pull the horse a little bit right now, seeing as we won't go until June of next year. Thanks. James Thalacker : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the thoughts. Jeff Martin : Thanks, James. Operator : [Operator instruction] We'll now take the next question from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Please, go ahead. Paul Zimbardo : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the time. Jeff Martin : Good morning. Paul Zimbardo : I want to follow up after the significant Oncor Capex increase that you've talked all about. How should we think about the potential for share repurchases and just overall thoughts on the balance sheet targets that you've previously articulated? Jeff Martin : I'll start with share repurchases. If you recall, Paul, that last summer we did an accelerated share repurchase program where we put to work about $500 million. I think the weighted average cost of that program was right around a $123 plus or minus. The Board also supported a new authorization of $2 billion. And the way we've long time thought about this is, we're really stewards of capital for you, our owners. And whatever creates the best pass for owners, that's what we're going to do. So we have a current outstanding authorization, as I mentioned. We actively review this as an opportunity from time-to-time, and we expect to be opportunistic in our approach. It's something that we continue to evaluate and it's something that we will use as we have in the past, opportunistically. In terms of the balance sheet, Trevor, you made some comments in terms of how you think about we ended last year in terms of FFO to debt and how you've grown the equity layer. Trevor Mihalik : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jeff. Paul, as you know, last year we ended right around 70% on the FFO to debt, and we're still tracking around that plus or minus 1% and feel good about where we are on the metrics. We also talked about our debt to equity layer, and we're also at the end of the Second Quarter at sub 50% right now. And again, we have the proceeds that will be coming in from the Sempra Infrastructure Partners transaction that we will be really utilizing to continue to shore up the balance sheet, and as Jeff says, looking at opportunities to deploy that in the most effective way for our shareholders. And we couldn't be more pleased about the opportunities around organic growth, share repurchases, or other opportunities to create shareholder value. Paul Zimbardo : Okay, great. And thinking -- and just to follow up on Jeremy 's question about some of the resource adequacy concerns we've seen in the West. Are you seeing any opportunities potentially increase or accelerate within the plant? Some of those I believe was 2 billion of clean power investments you detailed at the Analyst Day. Jeff Martin : Yeah. We talked about a couple of things. On Jeremy 's question, I was speaking more to what the investor on utility opportunity was. Obviously there are opportunities there around energy efficiency, primarily at SDG&E, the big focus on long-duration battery storage, which is desperately needed in the state. And the state has circled at about an 11.5 gigawatt opportunity for new resources. What you're referring to is on the unregulated cyber business in Sempra Infrastructure. You'll recall that Justin Bird is leading three separate P&L 's with Tonya and the team, one of which is clean power. So we do have about three gigawatts of development opportunities on the border. And we did preview a very interesting project, by the way, at the Investor Day, which is our battery storage projects. You may recall we have a combined cycle plant on the border. We've got 2 underutilized transmission systems that dispatch directly into the California Independent System Operator. And that thermal plant also has a second plant that was targeted 15 years ago for construction.  We've got all the transmission in place and that's been redesignated as a 500 megawatt opportunity for battery storage. So our goal is to be able to dispatch out of Northern Mexico with both wind and solar resources backed up and supported with its own resource adequacy from its battery production. You are making a great point. That is an opportunity we're going to be active to pursue it. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. Thank you again for the time. Jeff Martin : Thank you very much. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Jeff Martin, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or question remarks. Jeff Martin : Just a quick couple of comments here. As I know, it's a busy time of the year as people head into the summer vacation period, particularly on Wall Street but we look forward to seeing some of you in person at the Wolfe Conference in September. Steve always runs a great conference and we're looking forward to being back on the road. Additionally, I would mention that we're going to do some virtual conferences with Goldman and Citi, as well as some NDRs this summer in Asia. I hope everyone has a great rest of your summer and thank you again for joining us and feel free per custom to reach out to our IR team with additional questions. This concludes today's call. Operator : That's it for today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Nelly Molina, please go ahead. Nelly Molina : Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings call for Sempra. A live webcast of this teleconference and a slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors Section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure, Faisel Khan Chief Financial Officer of Sempra Infrastructure.  Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor, Kevin Sagara, Group President, and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today.  The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are these calls in the Company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q file with the SEC. All of the earnings-per-share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Nelly Molina : I would also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 5, 2021, and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Nelly (ph). Several years ago, we revised our business strategy to narrow the focus of the Company, to invest in an energy infrastructure and markets where we expect high-growth. Today, there's a growing in recognition about why these types of investments are increasingly important. Whether it's the current dislocation in European energy markets or high prices for RNG in Asia, or even challenging weather events here at home that call for greater resiliency. New investments in energy infrastructure are certainly needed.  Bipartisan support in Washington for the pending infrastructure bill provides further validation of this trend. In addition to help meet the needs of the market at Sempra, we certainly believe energy infrastructure right here in North America is a key driver of job creation, economic growth, and competitiveness across the economy. Moreover, maintaining the modern, flexible and secure network of electric transmission and distribution lines, natural gas pipelines, and storage facilities is essential to delivering affordable and increasingly clean energy to U.S. businesses and consumers while promoting growth across all sectors of our economy.  Against that backdrop, we'll provide a business update today On the key activities in our California and Texas utilities. Also, Justin Bird, our new CEO of Sempra Infrastructure, will provide an update on how he's organized that business to capture exciting new growth opportunities. This will be followed by a summary of our financial performance. As an overview for the quarter, our strategic focus on investment in energy infrastructure across each of our three growth platforms together with a commitment to operational excellence, continue to drive strong financial performance.  As you know, we have a long track record of continuing to raise our guidance, and then working hard to meet or exceed that guidance This is a result of our high performing culture and continuous focus on improving the quality of our operations. As a result of these efforts, we expect to be at the upper end of our full-year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range and we are reaffirming our full-year 2022 EPS guidance range. Now, please turn to the next slide where Justin and I will provide business updates.  Let me start with our California utilities. In August, SDG&E filed an off-cycle application with the CPUC to update its cost of capital effective January 1, 2022. This application would increase SDG&E's equity ratio from 52% to 54% ROE from 10.2% to 10.55%, while also lowering cost of debt from 4.59% to 3.84%. The application, if accepted by the CPUC, would supersede the automatic cost of capital adjustment mechanism. In terms of timing, SDG&E has requested a decision in the first half of 2022.  Also, at SoCalGas, we recently announced agreements expected to resolve substantially all material civil litigation against SoCalGas and Sempra, related to the 2015 Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility leak, with net after-tax cash flows for SoCalGas expected to ultimately be up to $895 billion after taking into consideration collection of existing insurance receivables and other adjustments. These agreements are important milestones that will help the community and our Company work toward putting this difficult chapter behind us. In addition, last month, SoCalGas issued an important technical analysis underscoring the essential role of clean fuel networks that leverage existing gas infrastructure to help California achieve its net 0 goals and more importantly, to do so more affordably and more efficiently than other alternatives. Moving now to Texas, Oncor announced this updated 2022 to 2026 capital plan of approximately $15 billion. It's important to note that this plan is a $2.8 billion increase over its 2021 to 2025 capital plan, that was presented at the 2021 Investor Day in June. At Sempra Infrastructure, we recently finalized a series of transactions, including the sale of a non-controlling interest to KKR. Completing the exchange offer and subsequent cash tender offer to purchase the publicly-owned IEnova shares and delisting IEnova shares from the Mexican Stock Exchange. Addition I'd like to note, related to the formation of Sempra Infrastructure, we've updated our GAAP guidance range for 2021 to include items expected to be reflected in our fourth quarter results. You can find the GAAP reconciliation in the appendix to the slide decks.  Please turn to the next slide. Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I want to make one follow-on point about Oncor. We've talked a lot in the past about being in the most attractive energy markets in North America, and Texas is certainly an example. Oncor today operates in one of the fastest-growing markets in the country with some forecast estimating that the Texas population will nearly double by 2050. With strong macro fundamentals across its service territory, Oncor just announced a record-high 5-year capital plan of $15 billion. This capital plan is primarily ear-marked to meet load growth with 2/3s of the plan, dedicated to expansions of the Company's transmission and distribution network.  Oncor's robust projected capital plan and rate-based figures are expected to support economic development across its service territory, increases in generation interconnections, strong premise growth, and critical new investments in grid modernization and resiliency. And finally, Oncor now expects to grow its rate base to nearly $28 billion by 2026, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of about 8% over the 5-year period. The growth the Company is experiencing is just remarkable. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll pass the call over to Justin, to review the latest updates at Sempra Infrastructure. Justin Bird : Thanks, Jeff. I'm excited to present the newly formed Sempra Infrastructure platform. We expect the formation of Sempra Infrastructure along with the financial strength of KKR to give us added scale to execute on a wide range of energy infrastructure opportunities across Sempra Infrastructure's 3 business lines. Since closing this transaction, a month ago, we're already seeing the benefits of combining the 2 organizations through financial synergies and commercial optimization. For example, we've been able to restock our capital structure to create meaningful cost savings. To capture new development opportunities, we've organized into three business lines, LNG and Net Zero Solutions, Energy Networks, and Clean Power.  We expect this structure will enhance growth and quality execution. This also strategically positions us to benefit from North America's continued trend toward the clean energy transition by optimizing the natural partnership between natural gas and renewables to help meet decarbonization goals here in North America and abroad. Energy infrastructure, as Jeff described at the top of today's call, is the focus of our development program.  Now, please turn to the next slide where I'll briefly discuss how we're advancing growth in each of our business lines. First at LNG and Net Zero Solutions, the LNG market has recovered quite dramatically as evidenced by the spot market with record high prices being seen in Europe and Asia and a recent uptick in long-term contracting activity around the world. With that constructive backdrop, our LNG development portfolio, is expected to benefit from the strategic advantage of being situated on both the Pacific and Gulf Coasts with direct access to both Asian and European markets. As a reminder, ECA LNG Phase 1, was the only LNG export project in the world to take a final investment decision last year, which reinforces the competitive advantage of Brownfield sites, that can dispatch into the Atlantic and Pacific basins. Now looking forward, we remain focused on the construction of ECA LNG Phase 1, working with our partners to optimize Cameron LNG 's current operations, as well as the development of the Cameron LNG expansion. And finally, working on an exciting new Pacific opportunity in Topolobampo, Mexico called Vista Pacifico LNG. at ECA LNG Phase 1, engineering, equipment, fabrication, and site preparation are well underway.  The project is on time and on budget, and we continue to expect first LNG production by the end of 2024. At Cameron LNG, the current facility is running well and hit record production levels during the month of October. Together with our partners, we're developing a projected 7 million tons per annum expansion project benefiting from 1 million tons per annum of debottlenecking trains, 1, 2, 3. With innovations and train design coupled with the high performance of trains 1 through 3, we expect this to be a very competitive, capital-efficient expansion. In terms of next steps, we plan to move to feed early next year to file an amendment with FERC to build Train 4 with electric drives in order to reduce Scope 1 emissions, and to work closely with our partners as we advance toward FID. Lastly, Vista Pacifico LNG is a new development project located adjacent to our Topolobampo refined products terminal. This new project is expected to be a mid-scale facility connected to two existing pipelines. One of them being the high-pressure pipeline system we own in Sonora. The project would source lower-cost natural gas from the Permian Basin for export to high demand Asian markets. At our Energy Networks in clean power businesses, I'd like to highlight two important projects. The expansion of the GROE pipeline and the expansion of our ESJ wind farm. The GROE expansion is a pipeline project in development that is expected to increase gas delivery capacity to the Baja Peninsula and play a critical role in supplying gas to the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. We continue to advance a series of our cross-border renewable projects that are expected to dispatch directly into California. Specifically, the ESJ Expansion, leverages the existing power transmission capacity that we own on the U.S. and Mexico border. We're the only Company that owns cross-border transmission lines that can connect into the California electric grid and that allow us to have a competitive advantage in helping the state meet its growing need for new renewable energy resources. I'm excited about the team we put together and about the business we're building. It's a unique opportunity, where well situated to compete and we certainly expect to play a crucial role in investing in energy infrastructure right here in North America that supports the global energy transition. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll pass the call to Trevor, to review our financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Justin. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $648 million or $2.03 per share. This compares to third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $351 million or $1.21 per share. On an adjusted basis, third quarter 2021 earnings were $545 million or $1.70 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $432 million or $1.49 per share. Please turn to the next slide.  The variance in the third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items; $35 million of higher earnings at Sempra, Mexico due to higher ownership of IEnova, $35 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas, $29 million of lower losses at parent and other primarily due to lower preferred dividends and $29 million related to the energy efficiency program refund in the third quarter of 2020 at SDG&E. Please turn to the next slide. We are pleased with our operational and financial performance this quarter and are focused on continuing to execute through the remainder of the year. We also think our strong year-to-date performance, sets us up well to have a great year in 2022. With that, this concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now stop and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] If you're using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Jeff Martin : Good morning Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to touch on the LNG market a bit here, interest and heard about the new prospects in Mexico that you were talking about, but just curious, I guess for your thoughts on the market. Right now, we've seen some others kind of signed some contracts close to 20 years pretty recently here. And so, it seems like the market could be improving. And I understand that there's two types of markets, the spot obviously being very strong right now, but you guys are looking at the long-term contracts and there's some different dynamics that go on there. Just wondering if you could help us think through how the market looks at this point for the longer-term contracts. Jeff Martin : Yeah, appreciate having the opportunity to answer that question. I'll pass it to Justin here momentarily, but I would just start by saying, in the LNG trade, the spot market's roughly 30% of the overall market. We think the market backdrop is quite constructive. We've been fairly bullish on LNG, as many of you know, for quite a long period of time. And I would say that we're quite optimistic based upon the level and nature of our current conversations with counter parties. But let me just pass it to Justin. Maybe you can give an overview of what you're seeing in the marketplace, Justin. Justin Bird : Thanks, Jeff, and hi, Jeremy. Yeah, I think we've seen a dramatic improvement in the market, both on the spot market, and I think importantly, you're starting to see some of these long-term contracts come back. Also, importantly, we're seeing higher forward curves over the next few years for deliveries into Asia and Europe. And I'd say the final thing that we're seeing that I think is important is you're seeing China 's reentry into the long-term market.  We are seeing a real uptick in our discussions, both in Asia and Europe, and frankly, as well as South America. So, I think we're going to see some exciting things coming over LNG portfolio and we should benefit from this constructive market backdrop. Again, we think we have a competitive advantage, the ability to dispatch directly into Europe and Asia. And again, over the long term, it's nice to see that we still see demand for LNG growing mid to high single-digits, which supports our long-term very bullish view on LNG development. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. Thanks, and maybe peeping towards California here. And thinking about the California investment opportunities and some of the reliability considerations that remain in focus, are there any near-term opportunities you see for San Diego Gas & Electric at this stage? And just you see smothers in the state in a moving forward and different initiatives. What do you think are next steps for you guys there? Jeff Martin : I'll give you a couple of fault. We're actually quite constructive on California. A couple of things I'd mentioned, as you may have seen the decision yesterday, where the PSC approved increasing the capacity utilization at Aliso Canyon, like they increased it from roughly 34 Bcf to 41 Bcf. And I would tell you, we're certainly committed to supporting a much cleaner economy in California. But the expectations today, Jeremy, is that traditionally, California uses roughly 39% to 41% of natural gas for its electricity production in the winter time because of low hydro levels.  I think there's much more focus now on that being closer to 45%. We could see record utilization of natural gas here in California in the winter and I think the PUC decision reflects that. More broadly both SoCalGas and SDG&E have made a commitment to be a leader in the clean energy transition, and this is going to inform not only our current investments, but how we're stacking capital investments going into the GRC next year. And Kevin, maybe you can talk about some of the things that you are seeing around battery storage and other things that could be near-term opportunities for SDG&E. Justin Bird : Thanks for that, Jeff. Thanks, Jeremy. Yes, we are seeing a lot of opportunities at both utilities. Jeff mentioned at the gas Company obviously, a lot of clean fuels opportunities around RNG and hydrogen. But you specifically asked about SDG&E. At SDG&E we're seeing a big push in the state, given what we've seen in the last couple of tight summers around more storage capacity, more generation capacity. I think SDG&E will have some filings in the next few weeks around more utility-owned battery storage.  I think you'll also see a lot more activity in the coming months and years around electric vehicles too. California has made a lot of bold commitments to move -- much more strongly toward electric vehicles. And, I think you'll see a lot of grid enhancements and good modifications in that area. But I'd also remind you that, climate resilience is a big thing here, and so continues to be a lot of wildfire mitigation opportunities to invest capital as well. Jeremy Tonet : Got it, that's helpful. I'll leave it there, thanks. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Jeff Martin : Morning Shahriar. Constantine Lednev : Good morning, team. It's actually, Constantine here for Shahriar. Thanks for taking our question. Just following up a bit on the LNG market question. As you're putting out a more discrete SIP project pipeline, are there big economics for the projects within that pipeline still in the same low-teens IRR range that you've targeted before for some of the discrete projects? And how do those differ between the 3 categories that you outline? Jeff Martin : So, I think you're talking about the return expectations across all 3 platforms? Constantine Lednev : Yes. Jeff Martin : What I would probably say is, in this midstream space, we target mid-double-digit levered type of returns. We think those are consistent across all those. Interestingly, on the Clean Power side, you may recall that we've seen returns come in here in the U.S. That's one of the reasons we exited that business two or three years ago. In Mexico because of our border position and the access we have to two very important transmission lines that bring power into the U.S., we think we have a real competitive advantage in that region.  So, we expect relatively higher returns in which, you might find in renewables here in the U.S. So, I would stick to say an overall of Justin 's portfolio, is going to manage toward mid-double-digit equity returns. One other thing I'll mention too to the broader LNG story, Justin and I got back from a recent trip to Europe, where we visited Warsaw, and Dusseldorf, and Berlin, and Brussels, and other places. There's a tremendous amount of recognition in Europe about the role for natural gas and specifically LNG. And there's certainly a new risk premium being assigned to pipeline gas. There's even discussions at the highest level of the EU about creating a strategic natural gas reserve. We've got a team on the ground next week in Asia. I think going back to the original point with Jeremy, there's a tremendous amount of conversations today. And I think this continues to reinforce our bullish case for LNG Constantine Lednev : Excellent, that's great color. And I guess also shifting to the updates and regulated CapEx. I mean, we're obviously seeing a healthy on core update, and do you anticipate a similar entry year cadence of an update for California? And maybe you could be a little bit more specific, as you're thinking about the opportunities that you outlined, is there any anticipation they are going to realign the focus with policy, both in state and federal, and the next iteration of those filings and GRC I suppose? Jeff Martin : Let me start a little bit more broadly. I think there's been a lot of interest as people have engaged with us over the last couple of months, about having better visibility into Sempra 's long-term growth rate. You've heard us talk about our track record in the past of growing this business. Whether it's a 10-year period or 20-year period, at an EPS growth rate of around 7% or 8%. I must tell you; we feel fairly confident in our ability to produce similar growth in the future, over 7 to 10-year period of time.  And part of that, is bolstered by this continued point that we make about the quality of the markets we're participating in, right? So, you've got the number 1 market in America is California. And the number 2 market is Texas. And I think Allen just has a remarkable story in Texas which keeps getting better. And to your point, we're going to have an opportunity to restack our capital program here in California. It's part of our GRC filing next year. And I think you should expect to see us to make filing requests around many of the things that Allen's doing, which is around resiliency, modernization of the grid, and making sure we're making those investments today that ensure that our infrastructure is future ready for what we need in the future, such as hydrogen and other things on the system. So, we have a fairly clear pathway to grow the business in California, very similar to Texas. And I think one of the things you're seeing on today's call is a pretty bullish case by Justin about what we can do in the Sempra Infrastructure business as well. Constantine Lednev : Well, I think that that's an abundance of clarity. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thanks, Constantine. Operator : We'll take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Jeff Martin : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just -- I wanted to go back to the Analyst Day and you specifically disclosed roughly $2 billion to $3 billion in additional CapEx at the utility. So, would this update -- what portion of that CapEx you've locked in or have included in the plan? Jeff Martin : So, I think, there were a couple of things I have to make sure I don't misunderstand your question. The difference between the 5-year strip from Oncor that we presented in June, which went through 2025, as compared to the new 5-year strip, which goes to 2026 is a difference of $2.8 billion. We also talked about the Analyst Day, the intra-period change in 2021 and 2022 from the prior year's period. So, I think that you've seen two things take place. Year-over-year, you've seen the 2021 and 2022 CapEx for our utilities increase. But since June of this year, you've seen Allen 's numbers increase by $2.8 billion. So hopefully that's helpful. Durgesh Chopra : Yeah, absolutely. But just -- in terms of like the Oncor CapEx itself, I think the number out there was like $775 million to $1.3 billion. Jeff Martin : Yeah, Yes let me address that and hopefully, this will be helpful. So, a couple of points. The 5-year strip, going back to June has increased about $2.8 billion per Allen's organization, and Allen had an incremental bucket separate from that of $775 million to $1.275 billion, and that incremental bucket has been unchanged. And maybe Allen, it would be helpful if this is the right time to maybe do things for our -- 2 things, for our listening audience, Allen, talk a little bit about what's in your $15 billion CapEx plan. And separately, what's not in the plan related to future rulemaking and related to your incremental bucket, which I think is the nature of the question. Durgesh Chopra : Sure Jeff. Yes, thanks. So, I think you described it very well. And what we've done today, is announced another billion dollars of Oncor CapEx over 5 years or $2.8 billion since the Investor Day, like Jeff said. That is really backed up by what Jeff mentioned in his opening remarks. Just tremendous growth that we can talk about across our system in a minute. But that $15 billion over 5 year is our new plan. To just point, a couple of years ago, we introduced this idea that, we had this other bucket, this incremental bucket of potential CapEx. And to just point that incremental bucket which we -- I think announced at $725 million to $1.275 billion. Trevor Mihalik : remains there unavailable. And so how does that work? Well, what we do every year when we sit down with our Board and come up with what is now the $15 billion plan, there will be some projects that come out of that incremental bucket and go into that $15 billion plan. However, at the same time, we're also looking out further on the horizon and seeing things that we think could be included in that second bucket, which is the incremental bucket. That is separate and apart.  As Jeff said, we have announced a 5-year $15 billion plan, that's where we are today. We, in addition have another bucket which remains around -- these are estimates, but $725 to $1.275 that is available. And in that incremental bucket, in case we get to this in a minute, are also things -- another thing that we've added to that bucket is potential CapEx related to legislative activities in Texas and those fall in several categories. One is this possibility that we can participate a little bit in the storage market in Texas. There's a 100 megawatts available for the entire state.  So, we think there is an opportunity there, about $20 million for RPs and we're hopeful that that will grow over time. The Second Bill SB1281, which Related to CCNs and an economic benefit test specifically related to those CCNs. We think there is about probably 50 million a year in those incremental transmission projects. On the emergency generation side, I know there's been a lot of interest in that. We're working through acquiring some capital leases on the emergency generation side right now.  We're planning on having about 10 megawatts under contract. By January 1, the CapEx impact of what we do on emergency gen, like several of these categories, will depend on how much we ultimately end up leasing. But right now, the -- we're seeing kind of 5-megawatt emergency gen, 2 to 5 megawatts, around $2 million, and bigger 30-megawatt kind on the back of trailers, around $10 million. So, we'll make -- we'll make an appropriate reasonable decision for our customers in the ERCOT market on how much of that will require -- we will acquire, and that will determine the ultimate CapEx impacts of emergency gen.  Then on similar -- that same bill also provide us the opportunity to acquire long lead time equipment that we might need for service restoration. We think we're probably around what I would call $10 million for general plan for 2022 with an additional potential 100 on top of that for the remainder of the five-year plan, a $100 million worth of equipment. But again, that ultimate number is going to depend $10 million on general equipment is one thing. But if we get into stack comps and SVCs and some of the larger equipment.  That equipment goes from -- it can be anywhere from $50 million to $70 million per site. And so, we're still looking at all these legislative opportunities, that's just a general approach at what we're thinking right now on each of those. And as I said, these dollars associated with potential CapEx, associated with the legislation coming out of Storm Yuri are right now in our incremental bucket. But as we refine them, they will ultimately be moved at some point -- could be moved at some point into our 5-year plan. Jeff, is that what's you're asking for? Jeff Martin : It is and I'll tell you the reason, there's so much enthusiasm from our team, as we've seen a $2.8 billion restack in that capital plan up to $15 billion since June. It has had no impact on the incremental bucket, which is still there as Allen described. And hasn't picked up yet some of the forward-looking opportunities around rulemaking in legislation. So, I think it's a very important story. And the last thing Allen, you might speak to is, the expected impact on rates. Allen Nye : You good Jeff. So, here's how the rate impact works. Of the $15 billion over 5 years, that we're talking about today, about 2/3 of that, is growth-related. So new customers, more or less, or expansion of customers. Of the increase that we're talking about today, the billion-dollar increase, about 80% of that increase is directly related to growth. And I should mention also 97% of that total amount of $15 billion over 5 is tracker eligible. So, as we make these investments, keep in mind that we are presently the low-cost investor-owned utility in the state we have the lowest rates, of all the investor on utilities.  We believe that because of this substantial growth we're seeing on our system -- even after 15 billion over 5, we will remain the low-cost provider, or at least close to the low-cost provider on the right side of that chart of the rates with all the investor-owned utilities. Generally, I think we're probably thinking rates could increase somewhat similar to inflation. But again, we're the low-cost provider now and we believe will be the low-cost provider at the end of five years in $15 billion. Thanks. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot, Allen. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you both. Appreciate you breaking that down that down for us. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to talk about federal legislation and in particular, green hydrogen, though there are other elements here that could benefit Sempra. You all have been innovators in a number of areas that could get support at the federal level. And I was just curious at a high level, I know the exact composition of the bill could change and obviously we are not even sure it's going to pass at all, but to the extent that we did see the framework that's been laid out, what are the areas that you're most excited about in terms of what that support might mean in terms of accelerating your plans or changing your plans? Jeff Martin : I appreciate having the opportunity to answer that question. I think back in 2018, you may remember Stephen that, there was a lot of discussion around being in regulated businesses -- unregulated businesses. And I think, we took the opportunity to redefine an investment-class. That said, at the end of the day, these are all energy infrastructure investments. And how you make money may be different in the regulated framework versus outside of the regulated framework.  And we really went to ground this idea of being ahead of others in define in the markets where energy infrastructure would grow the most. I think in my opening remarks today, I tried to really emphasize the point that energy infrastructure's quite hot in Europe and Asia, and the U.S. I think there is really well-positioned and the infrastructure bill that you're referring to, is certainly strong confirmation bias of the importance of this to U.S. And there's really a tailwind for Sempra around this clean energy transition. So, 4 topics I think come out today's Bill, could pass as early as today out of the house. One of which is we're tracking the private activity bonds. These are ones that allow you to finance carbon sequestration and carp carbon storage devices.  We think that's important for the sector. The IEA says there will not be a net-zero 2050 without carbon sequestration. And that's one of the reason that Justin 's business is focusing on this opportunity. Second to your very point, green hydrogen is a big part of our country's future. We've made a decision to participate in all the appropriate trade associations. We've got something like 10 to 12 different R&D Projects in hydrogen today. But specifically, in the legislation, the bill contemplates 4 regional hydrogen hubs in the country -- we think this will be important -- as you think about distribution centers. And one thing that people sometimes missed even as the number one manufacturing facility in the U.S., by a wide margin, is the LA Basin. And the number 1 industrial segment for the U.S. is the Gulf region between Texas and Louisiana.  So, both of these are areas that geographically we have a vested interest in, I think we've got a leadership interest in. So, I think hydrogen in both of those markets will be important. Two other quick points from today' s Bill : 1. is the focus on wildfire management, we talk about this Stephen, a lot in California. It's obviously a western region issue, It's an issue today in Europe and Australia and Ukraine and in different parts of the world.  But the build does contemplate support for vegetation management and improving resiliency, which is a very important topic here in California. 2. there's a lot of focus in the bill and electric vehicles. Trevor and I participated in the strategy session with Allen's board last week in Texas, the electric vehicle market in Texas is enormous.  Today, there's about 30 thousand vehicles on Oncor system In comparison, we're 120th the size of Oncor System here at SDG&E and they've got 70,000 vehicles on our system. So, I think electric vehicles will be very, very important and the bill is very specific, about funding opportunities all across the country to promote electric vehicles. So, those are the 4, we're probably following most closely. But we do share your optimism around green hydrogen. Stephen Byrd : Well, that's a really comprehensive answer. Thank you very much. Helpful to understand the areas you're focused on. Shifting gears just back to LNG, you raised a lot of good points earlier, about the strength of this market. The excitement around this market, and you guys are well-positioned, does that sort of level of excitement globally provide additional opportunities to either monetize some of your assets or to find just very low-cost ways -- low cost of capital ways to pursue additional growth like the additional opportunity Mexico you mentioned. In other words, could this be both the way to monetize as well use other people's money to help achieve better growth and better returns overall? Jeff Martin : Yeah. One of the things I would start with saying is the priority of our capital program is our U.S. utilities. And what we want to do is be able to grow our utilities at a rate faster than our peers and do that without coming back to the capital markets to issue separate equity. And that's one of the reasons that the KKR transaction was so important. It gave us a chance to crystallize and highlight value in that business and recycle capital back into reducing parent debt and meeting to the capital needs like Allen described today but I would tell you, I don't think we're finished, right?  That business now has been valued at roughly an enterprise value of $25 billion, so, we think about going forward. We think there will be strategic opportunities to bring that business to the market, but those are conversations we would obviously have with KKR and to your point, if we have the chance to further diversify the capital structure at higher valuations, that's something you should look for us to do. And we will be looking under Faisel and Justin's leadership at bringing in project equity on some of these projects to reduce the call of capital from Sempra Infrastructure. But right now, they are very, very focused on growth, and there's a lot of enthusiasm, of what they think they can accomplish. Stephen Byrd : That's great. Thank you very much, that's all I had. Jeff Martin : Thank you for being on the call. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Jeff Martin : Good morning. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my -- morning Jeff, thanks for taking my questions. 1 short-term, 1 long-term, 1 -- the short-term 1 is, can you remind us what's in guidance, what's assumed in your 2022 guidance in your growth trajectory for what happens in the California cost of capital dock and the mechanism. That's question A. Question B, longer-term, on the potential new Mexico LNG project, can you talk about what kind of pipeline development is needed to get the gas from the Permian to the site. Thanks, guys. Jeff Martin : Thank you. I'll pass the pipeline question in a second to Justin. And it's a really positive story there actually. But I would mention obviously, many of you on the call have been following the cost of capital developments, both for SDG&E, PG&E and Edison. I will remind you that, the SoCalGas mechanism did not trigger. We're going to follow this closely. I think the key gating item that, everyone in the state has fallen is the forthcoming scoping memo that, we expect from the commission.  But, in terms of forward guidance, what we've indicated in the past Michael was that, whether we get the automatic triggering mechanism or whether our application's approved, it is contemplated within our guidance for next year. And because of some other steps that, the business has taken to mitigate and become more -- mitigate cost and become more efficient. It's probably in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 either way.  But well, within our guidance range. And we would not expect to update guidance independent of that outcome. And then Justin, I think, a lot of times, particularly in domestic LNG development, there's always issues related to pipeline development. I think it'd be helpful to help our listening audience better understand what's unique about the pipeline system that supports Vista Pacifico? Justin Bird : Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Michael. Yes. Vista Pacifico would effectively source gas from the Permian from the U.S. basin and deliver it in the form of LNG to Asia. There are two existing pipelines that basically converged very close to the site, so there would be a very small spur type pipeline that we would build that we connect to PacificO2 existing pipelines, both of which are underutilized on a transmission capacity basis. So, I think very little pipeline construction associated with this. This is part of the strategic location of the project is its proximity to pipelines and the fact that 2 of those pipelines are very underutilized. Michael Lapides : Got it. And just 1 quick follow-up. Are you the only LNG, or potential LNG project competing to utilize those pipes? Justin Bird : Sorry, Michael, can you repeat that question. Jeff Martin : He is asking is your project the only one that's competing relative to those pipeline? Justin Bird : I think there is another existing development project that is north that is trying to get some capacity from one of those pipelines. Jeff Martin : Which we own. Justin Bird : Which we own. We own the pipeline, yes. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thanks, guys. Jeff Martin : Thanks, Michael. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : Good morning. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Levine : Hey, Jeff. Given the political uncertainty related to CFP contracts in Mexico, are there any proactive steps the SIP or broader Sempra organization is considering to mitigate the counterparty risks or other broader opportunities to capitalize on the growth in Mexico? And then related, did Sempra have any differentiated impact relative to its SIP partners in any policy change in Mexico in conjunction with the KKR agreement? Jeff Martin : I would start with your second question, which is KKR has their own infrastructure presence in Mexico, both on the refined product side of the value chain, as well as with renewables. They are certainly collaborating with us constructively with CSE, so that's been helpful. I can make a couple of comments to Ryan that because of our headquarters be in here in San Diego. You'll recall that we've been investing pretty consistently down in Mexico for close to 25 years. And what excites us back then still excites us today is you've got about a 130 million consumers. It's one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the Western Hemisphere.  And most importantly, is the largest synergy export partner for the U.S. at about 7 to 8 BCF per day. And I think even though we've got leading scale and expertise at Sempra Infrastructure, we're still very selective about the projects we expect to invest in. And even the Vista Pacifico project that Justin was describing, those capacity releases on some of these pipelines that, would be needed would come from the government. And this is really a government-sponsored project, and one that they've been quite public about supporting from a permit and pipeline capacity standpoint.  But curious you, I think is quite topical that, there are reform being proposed in electricity market. I think you'll expect to see the lower house vote on that, in the fourth quarter. But it would not clear the legislature until probably April of next year, and we handicap that, as a low probability. And what's interesting about this is, those reforms largely target to the point you made Ryan, generation assets that are connected to the CFE system. And today, we have a relatively small footprint in generation across all of Sempra because we're a T&D business.  I think the electric investments in Mexico account for roughly 1% of our consolidated earnings, and more importantly, the vast majority of all those projects, something like 80% are on the border with California are not connected to CFE and dispatch directly into the Cal ISO. But I will leave you with one thought which is probably the most important. We made the decision several years ago that what we really want to do is help President Lopez Abra be successful.  So, the majority of our conversations are focused on ways that we can partner with his cabinet to make Pemex be successful and make CFEB successful. So, when you see us announce projects like Vista Pacifica is because those will be done largely in tandem with the objectives of the government. That's one of the reasons we still feel good about those types of projects in Mexico. Ryan Levine : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Ryan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Paul. Paul Zimbardo : Hi, good morning, team. I said a question, if you could discuss at a high level, just how you think some of the latest cost estimates change for the Brownfield and Greenfield development projects? However, you want to frame it, what percentage changes, or just how to think about the latest commodity backdrop. Jeff Martin : So, I think there's 2 parts of that question. Number 1 is this issue of, how much inflation are we seeing in terms of, how we source our soft and hard costs at any of our projects, including our utilities. And we've got obviously some building mechanisms that help us with that on the utility side. In Justin's business, you recall that, we were very reliant on EPC wrap contracts, so the procurement and exposure to costs, we shift that risk to the construction contractor.  And that's why, it's important that they have strong credit counterparties. But in terms of Brownfield versus Greenfield, I think the way I would answer that, a very general levels to say, Brownfield projects always have a cost advantage, and Greenfield projects can be also quite viable. Typically, they B2B to be done at scale, and Port Arthur would be an example that, but coming back to our projects, think about this.  For us to have the opportunity to turnkey 6% to 7 Bcf -- I mean, 6 to 7 MTPA at Cameron expansion, Our view internally as it could be one of the lowest cost projects for new capacity in the world. So, our likelihood of going forward that we account as being relatively high and that's why we've got a 100% of MOUs in place to get to the next step and move to heads agreement from the SPAs there.  And then this to Vista Pacifica o, this is the type of price very similar to ecoPhase 1. Our expectation is it will be oversubscribed. That is a greenfield project but the geographic location to be able to have direct pipeline access from 2 different pipelines to Waha and to be able to dispatch directly into the Pacific, will be a tremendous and competitive advantage where we market that project. Paul Zimbardo : Okay, now that's great. And then shifting back to Oncor, thank you for that super detailed breakdown. Given the robust opportunity set should we think about October 2022 board meeting as the next opportunity for refresh, or should we think more of the 2021 pattern where those update sprinkle throughout the year? Jeff Martin : It's such a great question and I hate to foreshadow that we're going to be sprinkling things throughout the year. But I'll give Allen great credit. It wasn't that they had an ongoing process just to update their plan. They were looking at issues in the market around inflation and how they supply chain issues in advance. So, the real genesis of Allen updating Capex guidance was he came back to the boards so they can make forward purchases that allow them to keep their 2021 and 2022 capital plans in place. What they were doing is they are reaching forward to source what they needed to execute those capital plan. So, I think you would expect his team to do something very similar. Is there watching the marketplace if there's opportunities to adjust that they will.  And I think he made a great case for We didn't cannibalize that incremental bucket list. That's been replenished as we look going forward, I think that they will continue to look for opportunities to take price risk away from their capital program, and ensure that they can deliver the plan they have on the street today. Paul Zimbardo : Okay, great to hear. Thank you all. Jeff Martin : Yes. Thank you for joining us. Operator : We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Jeff Martin : Hello, Craig. Craig Shere : Hi, good morning in your time. So, do you see the potential for Topolobampo jumping ahead of Port Arthur, in the new project cue. And did I hear correctly that, the focus will be on securing equity from partners outside of SIP, where needed, If external equity is required for construction of 3 simultaneous accretive LNG product -- projects: ECA Phase 1, Cameron Phase 2, and of course something else. Jeff Martin : A couple of things here is the Topolobampo project will be very similar in scale to ECA Phase 1, kind of that 3 to 4 million-ton-per-annum size. It definitely can jump ahead of Port Arthur, so that's the answer to your first question. We certainly are quite bullish both on Cameron expansion, which is 6 to 7 MTPA, as well as the Vista Pacific project, which is closer to 4 million tons per annum.  In terms of equity, we're very comfortable with the level we're at today with KKR. Certainly, if we saw opportunities to diversify the capital structure at Sempra Infrastructure at points in the future at higher valuations, we would evaluate that against the opportunity to bring in equity down to project level. But definitely there's an interest to attract equity participation at the project level, given the size and scale of our expectations around LNG. Craig Shere : That's very helpful, and the last question, maybe Justin, if you want to opine, but we've kind of noticed that equity cargo capacity that can be delivered years in advance of new trained construction appears to be a major selling point for new long - term contracting. On track doing, like the latest Venture Global announcement included some short-term supply off their [Indiscernible] house. How do you see this market dynamic playing out with respect to SIPs portfolio? Justin Bird : Yes. It's a great point, Craig and I think you even saw Cheniere's deal today, had a lead into the bigger capacity coming at the long term. So, I would say, I wish I had capacity I could sell right now to bridge some of the construction on these other projects. Because I do think it is a competitive advantage. The market is very hot right now, and people are looking for volumes in the next few years. I think for us, it's a question of maintaining our financial discipline, potentially looking for partners where we can provide some bridge volumes into volumes coming from our facilities.  And then looking for potential excess volumes that could be available via the partners out of Cameron or when ECA Phase 1 comes online looking for some additional volumes as production actually starts and we see what production looks like. Yes, I think you raise a great point having volumes to bridge into these long-term contracts, I would say is a competitive advantage and it's something that we're focused on and looking for opportunities to find those types of bridging arrangements. Craig Shere : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. that we will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff Martin for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Martin : I just want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. We're certainly pleased to join the EEIC, EEI Conference virtually next week. And we're looking forward to spending time with as many of you as possible. Thank you again for joining us. Feel free to reach out to our IR team per custom with any additional questions. This concludes today's call. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today's conference. We appreciate you participation.",

I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nelly Molina. Please go ahead. Nelly Molina : Good morning everyone and welcome to Sempra's fourth quarter 2021 Earnings call. In live webcast of this teleconference and a slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Lisa Lorac Alexander, Senior Vice President Corporate Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer. Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure. Faisel Khan, Chief Financial Officer of Sempra Infrastructure, Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor, Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President, and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. All of the earnings-per-share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31st, 2021. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 25th, 2022, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide four and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Nelly. And thank you all for joining us today. In 2021, we delivered another year of strong performance. We'll discuss some of the operating highlights in a moment, but on the financial side, we invested over $7 billion in critical energy infrastructure, a record amount for our company. And we delivered full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $8.43 well above our increased adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.75 to $8.35 per share. The strength of that performance together with a portfolio of investment opportunities across all three of our growth platforms, gives us a lot of confidence in the future. Today we're announcing approval by our Board of Directors of an increased annualized dividend of $4.58 per share, consistent with our longstanding commitment to return value to our shareholders, record five-year capital plan of $36 billion with nearly 94% dedicated to our utilities continued confidence in our full-year 2022 EPS guidance range and the issuance of our full-year 2023 EPS guidance range. And finally, we're announcing a projected long-term EPS growth rate for the company of 6% to 8%. Please turn to the next slide. Next, I'd like to highlight a few of our accomplishments. From a strategic standpoint we've made great progress over the last four years, in updating our portfolio with three goals in mind. First, prioritizing markets with strong fundamentals and constructive regulation. Second, simplifying our business model to improve execution. And third, building scale, financial strength, and a high performing culture to deliver improved financial results. 2021 was another key milestone in that journey. We've completed a series of transactions to form Sempra Infrastructure a simplified growth platform with scale and portfolio synergies. All while generating over $3 billion by selling a non-controlling interest to support growth and the return of capital to our owners. Furthermore, these transactions highlight the underlying market value of this business and demonstrate Sempra's continued ability to source lower cost of capital and recycle it into organic growth at our utilities. Moving on, we continue to advance our capital plan in 2021 deploying over $7 billion with a continued focus on supporting the strong growth at our utilities. From a safety standpoint, we had record employee safety results at Sempra, California and Sempra Infrastructure also had a great year. Advancing construction at ECA LNG Phase 1 on-time and on budget with over 1 million hours work without a lost-time injury. Taken together, these accomplishments and the quality of execution we're seeing across our businesses, gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth opportunities. Please turn to the next slide. Sempra's growth platforms are strategically positioned in highly attractive and contiguous markets in North America, where we serve one of the largest utility consumer bases in the United States. Each of these growth platforms have both scale and a leadership position in our core markets, and that is central to our strategic execution. Please turn to the next slide. Our growth platforms benefit from three main competitive advantages : size and scale in attractive markets, lower risk and strong recurring cash flows associated with T&D investments, and positive growth trends centered on the expansion of energy networks to support cleaner forms of energy, improved safety and reliability, and the continued integration of North American energy markets. Our three platforms combined for nearly 300,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines, all in key markets in North America, while serving nearly 40 million consumers. These integrated growth platforms generated approximately $2.6 billion in 2021 full-year adjusted earnings and position us to grow earnings well into the future. Trevor will walk through the details on our long-term growth drivers later in the presentation. But at a high level, our projected growth of 6% to 8% is supported by strong continued investment at Sempra, California to support safety, reliability, and the state's ambitious energy transition goals, investment in our Texas utilities to support strong economic growth, and a significant interconnection queue loaded with renewables and disciplined investments at Sempra Infrastructure for fully contracted assets currently under construction, and potential upside to projected growth from projects we currently have in development. Finally, I think it's worth noting that the vast majority of our assets have some form of inflation protections built into them either through regulatory constructs such as upcoming rate cases or pass-through mechanisms on our infrastructure projects. Additionally, given our strategic focus on T&D infrastructure, the lower risk section of the energy value chain, we believe we reduced our exposure to many of the traditional risks in the energy space. Whether it's commodity exposure, extreme weather, retail credit, or stranded generation investments. As we continued to advance our role as a leader in the energy transition, we're also creating an opportunity on this call and future calls for our Chief Sustainability Officer, Lisa Alexander to update you on our progress. Please turn to the next slide. Lisa Alexander : Thanks, Jeff, for two decades, Sempra has been on a sustained path to decarbonize our business operations and the markets we serve. Innovation and new technologies are central to a clean energy future enabled by investments in three key capabilities : decarbonization, diversification, and digitalization. This past year we summarized our aspirations in each of these areas as part of Sempra's energy transition action plan, and I'm pleased to update you that we're making great progress. Here are a few examples. In California, SDG&E completed its inaugural issuance of $750 million in green bonds and secured regulatory approval for three new energy storage projects expected to total 161 megawatts. Additionally, SoCalGas achieved over 4% renewable natural gas deliveries to core customers in 2021. Moving to Texas, Oncor is doing an excellent job connecting customers to cleaner renewable sources of energy by expanding and modernizing Texas as fast transmission and distribution network. In 2021, Oncor connected nearly 2,200 megawatts of wind and solar generation bringing the Total renewables connected to Oncor system to approximately 15,500 megawatts. In addition to progress on its operations, Oncor has also entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility with sustainability linked to performance metrics. And lastly, at Sempra Infrastructure, the newly consolidated platform is advancing opportunities in renewables, hydrogen, ammonia, LNG, and carbon capture infrastructure. The company recently filed an amendment with FERC to incorporate electric drives that are proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project, which could help reduce facility emissions by up to 40% while continuing to help de-carbonized global markets. Earlier this year the company also announced an MOU with Entergy to develop options intended to accelerate deployment of renewable energy to power primarily LNG facilities. Across our industry, companies are adjusting their business models to meet customer demands for increasingly cleaner sources of energy. At Sempra, we think these trends play to the strength of our company and effectively create a tailwind for new and cleaner investments across our platforms. Please turn to the next slide where I'll hand the call over to Trevor to provide business and financial updates. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Lisa. To begin, we've had several positive developments at our operating companies. In the third quarter, SDG &E filed an application with the CPUC to assess its cost of capital for 2022, as a result of the extraordinary event of the COVID-19 pandemic. In December, the CPUC issued a scoping memo with a final decision expected later this year. Also, the CPUC authorized a memorandum account effective January 1, 2022, to track any differences in revenue requirements resulting from the interim cost of capital decision expected later this year. Additionally, the CPUC is working through the implementation of our renewable natural gas procurement standard. We're excited about this development and view it as a significant step forward in advancing the future of cleaner fuels here in California. Lastly, SoCalGas recently announced a bold new vision to develop a proposed green hydrogen infrastructure system to serve the Los Angeles basin called Angeles Link. As contemplated, this project would be the nation's largest green hydrogen infrastructure system and will deliver green hydrogen to the country's largest manufacturing hub to help decarbonize electric generation, industrial processes, heavy-duty trucking, and other sectors that are challenging to fully electrify. Shifting to Texas. Oncor set a company record for the number of new and active requests received for transmission interconnections in 2021, demonstrating the rapid growth in Texas and continuing opportunities for Oncor to grow its system. Oncor service territory continued to grow as well, with Oncor connecting approximately 70,000 additional premises in 2021. At Sempra Infrastructure, we signed two MOUs to advance our unique capability of delivering LNG into both the Atlantic and Pacific basins, the first with Entergy that Lisa discussed earlier and the second, an MOU with CFP to jointly develop Vista Pacifico LNG as well as the new regasification project in La Paz, Baja, California Sur. Additionally, Sempra Infrastructure established a new credit facility in the fourth quarter and issued its inaugural investment-grade bond last month. All with the intention of efficiently financing its growth along with internally generated cash flows. Please turn to the next slide where I'd like to go into additional detail. On an update relating to Sempra Infrastructure. Here the key takeaway is that we are making progress on our announced sale of an additional 10% interest in the business to audio. This transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions and third-party and regulatory approvals valued Sempra Infrastructure and an enterprise value of approximately $26.5 billion, which was $1 billion higher than the KKR transaction. We expect to use the proceeds to fund utility capital, execute share repurchases, and continue supporting improvements in the balance sheet. Please turn to the next slide where I'll review the financial results. Earlier this morning, we recorded fourth-quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $604 million or $1.90 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $414 million or $1.43 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2021 earnings were $688 million or $2.16 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings of $668 million or $2.28 per share. Full-year 2021 GAAP earnings were $1.254 billion or $4.01 per share. This compares to 2020 GAAP earnings of $3 billion, $764 million or $12.88 per share. On an adjusted basis, full-year 2021 earnings were $2 billion $637 million or $8.43 per share. This compares favorably to our previous full-year 2020 adjusted earnings of $2,342 billion or $8 per share. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in full-year 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the prior year was affected by the following key items. $78 million of lower earnings due to the sales of our Peruvian and Chilean utilities in April and June of 2020, respectively, $126 million of lower earnings from a CPUC decision in 2020 that resulted in the release of regulatory liabilities at Sempra, California, related to prior year's forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account. This was offset by $216 million due to higher earnings from Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase 1 achieving full commercial operations in August of 2020 and asset and supply optimization primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices in higher volumes. $139 million of lower losses at parent and other primarily due to the lower preferred dividends from the mandatory conversion of preferred stock and lower net interest expense. $52 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas, $44 million charge in 2020 for amounts to be refunded to customers related to the energy efficiency program at SDG&E, $37 million of higher earnings at Sempra Texas utilities, primarily due to increased revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital and customer growth. Please turn to the next slide. We continue to see robust opportunities to invest in our utilities and infrastructure businesses, resulting in a $36-billion five-year capital plan, the largest in our history, and notably at $4 billion increase over the prior plan we announced last year. This plan is anchored by $33 billion of utility investments, representing nearly 94% of the total capital plan. For SDG &E and SoCalGas, safety and reliability continue to be at the forefront of our planned expenditures. This is important. Our investments in California centered around the State's regulatory priorities, including wildfire safety and integrity and safety of our gas infrastructure, along with technology investments. Additionally, at Oncor, the capital plan addresses the strong organic growth. For example, the population of Texas increased more than any other states in 2021, continuing the need for further investments to support this growing demand. Please turn to the next slide. These capital investments in top-tier markets in North America are driving tremendous growth in our projected rate base. In 2017, we had $14 billion of rate base at the California utilities. And through adding our interest in Oncor, as well as organic growth at both our California and Texas utilities, we grew our rate base to $41 billion in 2021 and expect to grow it even further to $62 billion by 2026. Just as importantly, we expect to support the strong projected growth without issuing common equity. Notably, over the next five years, our rate base mix is not expected to change materially with approximately 70% of total rate base dedicated to electric infrastructure, which reflects how well-positioned we are to continue supporting strong trends in electrification in our core utility markets. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll provide additional details on the opportunities we have to efficiently fund our growing rate base. As we think about our financing strategy, we have multiple opportunities to efficiently fund the expansive growth that we're experiencing at our utilities. Over the past few years, you've seen us rotate capital to fund utility growth, while also strengthening the balance sheet, finishing 2021 in a strong position with 47% total debt-to-capitalization, an 18% FFO -to-debt. Looking forward, our financial plan is underpinned by a portfolio of strong operating cash flows that are backed by regulated returns or long-term contracts. Our robust utility capital plan is further supported by cash generated from Sempra Infrastructure, where projected cash distributions to Sempra combined with the proceeds from the sales to KKR and adia are expected to provide over $7 billion from 2021 through 2026. Turning to the dividend we continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 50% to 60%, which allows us to aggressively invest in utility growth while supporting the dividend. In addition to the dividend, we see opportunistic share repurchases as a way to efficiently return capital to shareholders from time-to-time. We remain focused on delivering shareholder value and through this efficient financing strategy, we expect to deliver strong EPS and dividend growth without issuing external common equity. Please turn to the next slide where I'll discuss our near-term EPS guidance ranges and projected long-term EPS growth rate. We are reaffirming our 2022 EPS guidance range of $8.10 to $8.70 per share, and we're introducing our 2023 EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20 per share. The aforementioned guidance includes plans to continue returning capital to our owners in the form of $1 billion of share repurchases. This would be an addition to the $500 million of share repurchases we recently completed. Now, let me talk about our longer-term growth. Our historical execution combined with the growth opportunities in front of us, give us confidence in providing a long-term EPS growth rate of an annual average of 6% to 8%, starting at the midpoint of 2022 EPS's guidance through 2026. This 6% to 8% growth is driven by our five-year capital plan and continued operational excellence across our businesses. It is anchored by an 8.5% projected rate-based growth at our utilities and only includes projects currently in construction at Sempra Infrastructure. Importantly, we see opportunities to outperform this projected growth rate through incremental investments across our three platforms. A few examples would include additional spending on energy storage, wildfire mitigation, electric vehicle infrastructure, and related make ready work, and pipeline safety and reliability in California further economic growth driving transmission and distribution expansion in Texas, and lastly, executing on incremental LNG and other development projects at Sempra Infrastructure that are currently outside the plan. Please turn to the next slide where I'll highlight our historical execution. This slide is a good depiction of how we've historically met or exceeded our published EPS guidance ranges. And done so consistently, reflecting our long track record of disciplined capital allocation, thoughtful execution and a commitment to deliver on our financial projections. Please turn to the next slide. Let me summarize our investment proposition. We've invested time and energy in building a high-performing infrastructure company that is well-positioned in some of the fastest-growing markets in North America. Overlaid with a commitment to capital discipline, we have a track record of operational excellence, disciplined financial execution, and dedication to consistently returning value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Bottom line, we're excited about the future of Sempra and the critical role that our infrastructure will play in supporting future economic growth in the energy transition. Please turn to the last slide. Over the last four years, we've continued to update our portfolio with a view towards prioritizing markets with strong fundamentals, and constructive regulation and simplifying our business model to improve execution and building scale, financial strength, and a high performing culture to deliver improved financial results. With the benefit of those strategic efforts, it allowed us to end 2021 in a strong position. And looking forward, we have three integrated platforms with improved visibility to future growth. With that, this concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now stop and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : Morning. So really comprehensive update Jeff and Trevor, but I just -- starting off as we look at your 6% to 8% growth profile, we get a pretty good sense of the utility growth, but as we think about maybe drilling down a bit further and bifurcating the growth, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of SIP? Any color on the cadence of growth there, as ECA phase I moves to completion in \u201824, do you see a more level earnings contribution from renewables and energy networks? Jeff Martin : Thank you for that question, and certainly, I think you're making a very interesting point. You can tell that 94% of our five-year capital program is dedicated to our utilities, and this is not the first year that we've made that type of prioritization. You've seen us grow our U.S. rate base from the end of 2017 which was about $14 billion to roughly $41 billion today, so that remains an ongoing priority. The capital that is in the plan today for Sempra Infrastructure, it is fairly conservatively projected, as you know Shar, our convention really is to focus on projects where we have already taken FID and they're in construction. I might refer you to Slide 34, where it outlines a basket of incremental opportunities that we certainly think could be quite positive for the company. There is about $5.2 billion to $5.7 billion of incremental opportunities. I think part of that informs our view that our projections are fairly conservative. Shahriar Pourreza : Jeff Martin : Shahriar Pourreza : Jeff Martin : Shahriar Pourreza : Jeff Martin : Operator : We will pick our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rich Sunderland : Jeff Martin : Rich Sunderland : Jeff Martin : Rich Sunderland : Jeff Martin : Rich Sunderland : Jeff Martin : Justin Bird : Great. Thank you, Rich. And thank you, Jeff. So I think as Jeff mentioned, given the robustness of the LNG market and what we view as our privilege platform in the Pacific Gulf -- Pacific and Gulf Coast locations, I think you're seeing two things. One, we're seeing a dramatic increase in the market interest for our facilities. And two, I think you're seeing heightened confidence in our ability to execute on our development projects. First, speaking of Cameron, we're making great progress on the expansion. Project at Cameron, given the timing of the filing of the amendment to the FERC permit, we're now targeting FID in the first portion of 2023. We're also making great progress on Vista. We are actively marketing about 10 million tonnes per annum of offtake and we're seeing. Extremely high levels of interest. So make no mistake, we're working with our partners and customers to get them supply as soon as possible. I wish we could give them more now, but as many of you know, the projects take time to develop, permit, and build. Also, we've made great progress in the last 24 months on Cameron. We reached full COD in 2020, hit record production last quarter, and we're working with our customers and partners to accelerate the debottlenecking of the phase 1. We took FID on ECA in November of 2020, as Trevor mentioned, the projects on time, on budget and being done safely. We expect first LNG there towards the end of 2024, and you should expect us to optimize volumes out of ECA once we reached full production. So to really sum it up Rich, we're focused on delivering LNG to our customers under long-term 20-year contracts. LNG demand is growing about 5% to 10% per year. And you should expect us to grow with the market or better, and lastly, we think we can deliver superior risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders by making disciplined investments in our LNG infrastructure. Rich Sunderland : Greg thank you for the commentary there. Justin Bird : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey. Good morning, team. Thank you for taking my question. Jeff, big picture, what do you see of the regulated versus non-regulated earnings mix evolving here from '22 to 2026 in [Indiscernible]. The majority of the increase in capex is dedicated towards utilities. How are you thinking about that? Any updated thoughts there? Or how should we think about that business [Indiscernible] over time. Jeff Martin : Yeah. One of the things that was excited about for today's call was one of the slides that showed that at the end of 2017, our U.S. utility rate base was $14 billion. Today, it's $41 billion and by the end of the five-year period that you are addressing is going to be $62 billion. And we have a fair amount of confidence to be able to grow that size of rate base. That's a 4.4 times growth over that nine-year period of time. And I think what that really reflects is the benefit of over the last four years, our capital recycling program and our focus on these T&D marketplaces where if you're in the right markets with good regulation, you can continue to produce higher recurring cash flows and grow your business faster than your peers. We certainly think that one of the arguments that comes through in our materials is the important role that Sempra Infrastructure plays in supporting that growth. So if you go back to the December timeframe of 2020, the market was valuing the IEnova business and LNG business at about $9 billion. We have a slide here today that shows our ability to basically extract roughly $7 billion out of that business to support the type of growth you're seeing in our utility. So I think my conclusion would be we have three very strong platforms that are very capable of growing. Each of them have scale and a leadership position in the markets they serve. I think we've got this thing teed up to deliver really good results in the years ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. That's helpful, Jeff. Thank you. Just one quick clarification on the MOUs at Cameron LNG and the Vista Pacifica. That would be the additional capex there. What kind of the balance sheet grew? Would you need equity for that additional capex or you think you can absorb that would in the context of upside to the capex plan? Jeff Martin : Right. Yeah. Justin talked about this opportunity that we're working on for $10 million tons per annum of new capacity. They have a self-funded business model today where they can resource third-party equity at the project level. They can also call in their equity partners. And one of the things that's really exciting about the Sempra Infrastructure transaction was, we set that business up with an investment-grade balance sheet and a mandate that they self-fund their business. And when they can return capital to the parent to support our share repurchases and our dividend program and our growth and our utilities, they can do that. So I think one of the things that Trevor oftentimes says is, that business produces a flywheel of cash, and that has been very instrumental to Sempra success in growing this utility platform, and we'll look to them to help finance their growth on LNG side. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thank you so much, guys. Appreciate the update today. Jeff Martin : Thank you for joining us. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hey, hi. I guess it's afternoon here. The -- just a follow-up on LNG and specifically Cameron. If you do get to FID in first half of '23, when would Cameron likely be online, expansion? Justin Bird : So in terms of the additional train, it would roughly be four years. After that I think the other thing to remember about the Cameron project as a whole, as I mentioned, we're looking to accelerate the debottlenecking, which we think can produce an incremental 1 million tons per annum. And we would expect that to come online prior to the full second train. Sorry, the full additional train at Phase two. Jeff Martin : So the way to think about Steve would be fully online by 2027, which is about a 48-month period of time. Justin is making a great point, we're looking to have access to additional volumes from debottlenecking, probably within our five-year plan period. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And that would be incremental to the plan, the debottlenecking [Indiscernible] Jeff Martin : That's correct. That's something we're following very closely. It's important. Steve Fleishman : Okay. That's great. And then Jeff, obviously you've got a new long-term growth rate out, the stock has been doing better this year, and that's great. And so -- but I'd be curious if you were to -- what would make you consider changing the structure of Sempra, i.e. breaking off SIP or selling more SIP. What are the things that could change the way it is or you're likely, given the way this is all coming together just to continue the path you've laid out today? Jeff Martin : I will give you a couple of comments, Steve and I mentioned some of this earlier in the call, but I think today's call really is a combination of what we've been talking about in terms of our strategy and the value being focused on T&D platform that really privileges U.S. utility growth, right? So we're very pleased with the progress we've made over the last four years and be able to grow our earnings per share over that four-year period at about 11% rate and fund these record capital plans while returning capital to shareholders. So we've got a pretty virtuous model going for us right now. One of the things I would ask you to think about is we have a very rigorous strategy discussion with our Board we met earlier this week. Strategy is discussed at every single regular meeting of the Sempra Board through the lens of how we can push more and more value back to our shareholders. And I think you can tell from the last three or four years, we're not going to be bashful. If we see an opportunity to unlock the balance sheet and buyback more shares or adjust our dividend policy, we're going to do that. But I think right now the key takeaway from this call is we have a record capital campaign. We've gone from 2017 when I was the CFO of having a $16 billion five-year plan, Steve, it's 20 billion higher in over a four-year period of time. So our number one opportunity is to make sure that we're funding as a first priority, what we think is a very attractive capital program and continue to look for opportunities to unlock value. And I think we've demonstrated a willingness to do that. Steve Fleishman : Great. Just last question on the balance sheet. I appreciate the FFO to debt metric and the like. Just have the -- have you gotten any comment from the rating agencies on the updated plan and how they are thinking about it? Jeff Martin : Thank you, Steve. I'll pass that to Trevor for commentary. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. Yes, Steve, we have gone and highlighted the plan with the rating agencies and gotten some of their feedback. We will do it in a bigger way in subsequent weeks here. But they understand where we are on things. And again, we feel very good about the 18% FFO to debt that we ended the year at and continue to strengthen the balance sheet, that is a priority of mine and continued to fund the capex plan. Justin Bird : I would also mention, Steve, and we've talked about strengthening the balance sheet, probably every year for the last four years, and I think you're seeing that benefit. So you think about the high watermark in the second quarter of 2018 when we finished the completion of the Oncor acquisition, our debt-to-capitalization was about 57%. So we've really sickened our equity layer today. At the end of the year of 2021 it was 47%. So you're seeing us Fortress the balance sheet with a view towards supporting more growth for our shareholders and the return of capital in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. Steve Fleishman : Great, great. Thank you for the thorough update. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Steve Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jeff Martin : Hi Michael. Michael Lapides : Hey, Jeff. Congrats on a good end-of-year call and a great start for 2022. Lots of exciting things going on. Curious, a couple of questions on the core utilities. One of which is that if I look at your rate base and your net income guidance. Your net income growth rate that the California utilities are mid-single-digit range. I think I just invented a word [Indiscernible]. Mid-single digits for '22 and '23, but rate base growth is double-digit both of those years from '22 and '23 and then at Oncor, it's kind of the opposite. The net income growth is low double-digit in '22, but the rate base for it kind of in that 8% to 9% range. Can you just remind us what's driving the big spread between rate-based growth and net income growth, albeit it's a little different in California, [Indiscernible]? Jeff Martin : Let me just start with a little bit of context. I think one of the things we're excited about and you've seen us dedicated our focus to improve the quality and scale of our us utilities that's reflected in our rate base numbers, Michael. But California rate base projections are clipping along at about 9% CAGR. And that Allen's organization, Oncor is growing at roughly 8%. And on average, you put those two together and they're growing about 8.5%. I'll take your point, which you would expect earnings to roughly over long periods of time to reflect that type of rate-based CAGR. In California, you recall that we're going into a rate case cycle. That first year where rates are in effect, you usually see a large step-up and it's that portion of the new rate base that's coming into that cycle. And at Texas, you have a little bit of a lag in terms of how they're mechanisms work. But I think the larger point you're making is you don't have visibility to year three or four or five from a growth standpoint. But that differentiation you're seeing should basically come together closer to the overall rate base growth over the five-year period. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. And then this is a busy regulatory year. I mean, you got a file rate cases in California. And I think you have to file in taxes. Is there any scenario where hopefully more so on the Texas side, you could get an incremental one-year delay? There are a bunch of other utilities like into deep taxes and others filing in Texas this year. Do you have -- do you feel you have the need to file in Texas or is this some filing but that you're kind of required to make. Jeff Martin : Yeah. Let me make a couple of contextual comments and I'll pass it to my partner, Allen and I here in just a second. But you remember here in California, we're going to follow our cases later this year, both for SDG&E and SoCalGas. Those cases will flow into 2023 with a view that those rates will be effective on January 1, 2024. In Texas, Allen has prepared his team for his rate case filing. But Allen, I'll let you speak to how you're prepared for that case, how you think about the timing of that case relative to some of Michael's comments. Allen Nye : Sure, Jeff. Thanks, Michael. Yes. Just initially, let me say, when we extended our rate-case deadline filing last year, we got a deadline set of on or before June 1 of this year. So right now, we're required to make the filing on or before June 1. I'll tell you, probably looking at call it mid-May for a filing. We're putting together what we think is a very strong case, we have obviously very aware of what other utilities have done down there recently and what the outcomes have been. I feel strongly, I've said it before, rate cases are very company-specific, very fact-specific. They relate in a large way to the way you've run your company over time. Your relationships with your constituents and the PUC. And we feel very good about all those connections in the history of how we perform with these rate cases. So I'm not going to front run my lawyers and my experts, my witnesses, and I can't really get into what we think we're going to file, obviously, ROE and Cap structure are always big in these cases, and that'll be a focus of our cases as well. And then just the only other thing I would add, I think somebody said in the opening comments, I think everyone is where -- we do have the lowest rates of any IOU in Texas. And if you're going in for a rate case, that's a good place to be. So all-in-all, right now we're looking at mid-May, we don't think there's going to be another extension. There's obviously a lot going on at the commission right now, but we feel good about where we are and that's our current plans. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Allen. Thank Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Michael. Operator : We will take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi, please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Hey, everybody. Jeff Martin : Hey, Ryan. Ryan Levine : Hey. What's included in the $1 billion to $1.1 billion of Energy Networks potential project? And how is the contracting in developed environment today in light of the commodity and political backdrop to comparison with previous quarters? Jeff Martin : Thank you, Ryan for that question. You recall that we announced a recent MOU with CFE. And one of the things that the country is trying to address is, as they went through their reforms from 2013, they've essentially overbuilt their pipeline network at the time with a view toward building a lot more natural gas-fired generation to replace a lot of their oil-fired plants, so their older plants. Some of that pipeline capacity is unused. So one of the things that's important in that MOU is that our partnership with CSE is designed to basically utilize some of their pipeline system to support the Vista Pacifico project, which reduces the cost that they are bearing for that capacity. And secondly, there's a work around planned where they've agreed to help us put the Sonora pipeline back into service network, involve additional capital. And we've got our opportunities here, particularly in Baja. One of the things that Tonya always reminds us up is Baja California and Baja Sur is literally disconnected from a gas and electrical standpoint from Mainland Mexico. So this situation where San Diego Gas, Electric sits and this North Baja position that we picked up in terms of our power position in renewables, as well as our pipeline position, we think there will be continued opportunities there and in the future for pipelines to be built to support growth in Baja. Ryan Levine : Thank you for that. And then in terms of your guidance, what are the components of the parent costs reduction between 2022 and 2023 that you're guiding towards? Jeff Martin : So I will tell you that we're managing a number of things. The biggest obvious issue in our parent costs is how we manage our overall interest cost. And the second thing, when we talked about that in the prepared remarks about some of our preferred equity going away year-over-year. But we also have been managing down our overall SG&A for the parent. I don't know if -- Trevor, if you want to add any additional remarks on our parent costs year-over-year? Trevor Mihalik : Yeah. No, Jeff. I think you pretty much touched on it. The higher parent losses were primarily due to less interest savings driven by a higher capital plan. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then last question for me in terms of battery outlook, recognizing the recent regulatory filings, do you see any upside to the spending in California? And are you looking at any electric batteries for Mexico? Jeff Martin : Yes. We definitely have a Volta project very much adjacent to TDM in Mexico. You may remember that when TDM was built back in the 2000 period, they had plans for a second combined cycle plant to be built adjacent to TDM. That project has now been dedicated to batteries and Justin's teams evaluating a 500 megawatt battery project out of that location. I'll turn it over to Kevin. We actually are quite bullish on batteries here at San Diego Gas & Electric, and maybe Kevin you can contextualize that opportunity for the utility. Kevin Sagara : Yeah. Thank you. Hey, Ryan. So we were happy to see the PUC approved earlier this month. Our advice letter around three new energy storage projects that total ed of about a 160 megawatts, that's about $300 million -- $380 million capital investment. There were three different projects there, all lithium-ion. I think we're going to see more and more of this. We are seeing with the Cal ISO study that came out, there's a big need for a lot more resources like this and I think we're going to see a tremendous amount of energy storage still to get built. And what will get our fair share of that like we did here. Thank you. Operator : [Indiscernible] next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeff Martin : Hi, Julien Dumoulin. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Congratulations on the continued results. Jeff Martin : Thanks. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Just with respect to Ryan's last question, maybe I'll start with the strategic one here. As you think about the Sempra Infrastructure side, you all have done a lot in the gas-based. You also, obviously located in California, principally. Renewable natural gas was mentioned in your comments here, how do you think about leaning into opportunities that might avail themselves specifically as some of those opportunities become perhaps more right, if you will, across the Western U.S.? Jeff Martin : I'll give you a couple of thoughts and maybe Kevin, you can follow me. But I think one of the things, and I actually had the opportunity to follow Edison's call yesterday too, that you're seeing is there is no longer a conversation about whether there's going to be a clean energy transition, Julien. The conversation now is about how fast it can happen and what the different mix of technologies in fuels will be. And I think in California, one of the areas that we're fairly prideful about our leadership position is we see a marketplace here where there there's a big and growing role for electrification in the form of green kilowatt, but there's also big role for green molecule. So I think this decision you saw yesterday very much validates the adjacencies in the existing value of SoCalGas system. They just completed 4% of the core deliveries last year from renewable natural gas and this new mandate will up that number to about 12.5% by 2030. And that ruling came after SoCalGas had already committed to get to 20% by 2030. So I think the role of renewable natural gas, our recent announcement around the Angeles Link for hydrogen. These are going to be big opportunities. I think our footprint to your point, it's going give us a lot of opportunities, both on the regulated and unregulated side. And Kevin, you've long been a leader in our innovation at the company. Maybe you can provide some color around how you're thinking about renewable natural gas and hydrogen. Kevin Sagara : Yeah, I think we've spoken about this before to Julien, which is just around this idea that clean molecules have a big role to play in this energy transition and I think obviously, you saw what we announced with Angeles Link. We got some favorable feedback from various stakeholders around the state around that project. And you see this decision by the CPUC authorizing this renewable natural gas standard for the utilities, which is an acknowledgment that, hey, the gas companies\u2019 infrastructure are going to have a big role to play in this clean energy transition within the state, helping the state reach its aggressive decarbonization goal. So we view this as all of like a positive step and it's demonstrating that there is a role in the state for clean fuels along with a lot of electrification. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent guys, I'm curious to see when it becomes more material. Maybe if I can just talk on numbers here. As you think about this new CAGR that you've all laid out, can you talk a little bit about the funds ability between buybacks and used deployment just in share repurchase versus today, going to an LNG FID or the debottlenecking. Obviously, there's several different scenarios that could play out here. Can you talk about how maybe capital going into an LNG FID could potentially effectively delay so that earnings recognition in the 27, but ultimately be accretive to your CAGR as I understand it? So maybe what's assumed in the form of buybacks and then ultimately, what is that incremental opportunity if you can kind of define it relative to the CAGR? Jeff Martin : Well, let me take a shot at it. And if I don't answer it accurately, please come back and we'll try to make sure I get a more fulsome answer. But I would start with the fact that you've seen our capital program grow from about $16 billion over five years in 2017 to $36 billion. So the cornerstone of our program going forward is the fact that all three of our platforms have very strong growth. And against that backdrop, we understand that we're accompanied where we need to privilege the dividend, right? So our investors expect us to return capital in a very competitive way with our dividend and what you've seen us do in the summer of 2020, Julien, and now most recently in the last 90 days, it put a billion dollars of share repurchases to work. And again, as someone mentioned earlier, flexing the balance sheet a little bit, between now and the end of 2023, to put another billion at work. So when we think about that return of capital, it's really a two-pronged opportunity, of dividend, juxtapose beside the share repurchases. Now, to your point, as you go forward in the plan, there are a variety of things that could cause our plan to get bigger when you think about LNG, I've made this comment earlier in my prepared remarks. But we certainly think what's unique about Sempra Infrastructure is we've given them a mandate to be self-funded, right? So they are in a position where with an investment-grade balance sheet that can source the capital markets, they can source debt, they can raise money at the project level. They've demonstrated a willingness to do that. So think about Cameron as example. We originally owned about 50% of that project. And through our sell-down at Sempra Infrastructure to 70% level today, our look through equity participation at Cameron today is roughly 35%. So we have a lot of flexibility under Faisel's leadership and Justin's leadership to make sure that we're very disciplined before we spend dollars on the LNG business. But their job is to risk adjust those cash flows in a way that makes sure these accretive opportunities for the Sempra shareholder. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. So just on buyback commitment, that's assumed in the plan, there is no specific number per se? Jeff Martin : So I think what we're saying is that we have identified programmatically that we're going to spend another $1 billion around share repurchases between now and 2023, and beyond that will be opportunistic based upon what's in front of us and what we think creates the best, kind of adjusted Total shareholder return for our investors? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely a lot of moving pieces here, thank you again and congrats once more. I'll speak to you guys soon. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Julian. Appreciate it. Operator : We will take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Craig Shere : Hi. Congratulations on another good quarter and the ongoing growth. Jeff Martin : Thank you Craig. Craig Shere : Jeff, you mentioned the stressed and uncharted global energy markets and the related opportunities on slide 34 for more Sempra Infrastructure projects. Now, up to $9 billion of incremental accretive projects, it's certainly nothing small. But that seems to ignore Port Arthur and ECA Phase 2. I realize for various reasons, some of these additional projects may be more towards the end of the decade, but in a perfect storm of global energy and security, there may be quite an appetite for multiple large-scale projects that while mainly not FID exactly the same time, maybe they can overlap in construction of our one or two years and be quite a bit to digest in terms of their overall size. So the first part of my question is, in a perfect storm where the world needs help, would you be willing to take on that much? And if we're looking at perhaps $20 billion of SIP, growth capex two decades then. And I notice this is -- was asked in a different manner. But what I'm trying to get at is it got to be that big. Does that necessarily augur for additional structural change? Jeff Martin : Yeah. It's a really interesting set a question and I want to compliment you because you have long been a follower of the LNG markets and we've always appreciated our dialogue with you and your firm about this. But you used twice this reference to a perfect storm and we don't take too much confidence or happiness in the fact that we've been predicting this for over five or 10 years. This need for what needs to happen in the middle of decades and we certain no one forecasted what's currently taking place. And I think perfect storm is the right characterization of it. Look, there's no question that there is a commitment globally to clean energy transition, but there's a growing recognition that that transition, Craig, has to happen in an orderly way. As you think about both developing markets and OECD nations, there is a strong and growing role, a very important role for natural gas, and LNG is really going to be the feedstock that allows both Europe and Asia to make that transition with order in a way which is affordable. It is the natural partner to renewable, so I think we're in a very fortuitous position. I think you're really describing for us a high-class problem, so we do have a unique set of assets both from the West Coast, and the Gulf that can be responsive. Now we can't suggest this point be responsive in the short-term, but over the long term, we have a very bullish view of what can happen in our portfolio. Maybe Faisel, who is the CFO of that business, maybe you can think about to Craig's question, Faisel, how you think about that opportunity and how it could be flexed and how big it could be for our company. Faisel Khan : Yes, Craig, I think that would the awesome if we could do all these projects all the same time. But obviously, you have to be disciplined about how we do it. So if we think about over the long run how we're going to source that capital. So at Sempra Infrastructure, obviously when ECA Phase 1 comes online, we're going to have a step-up in cash flows there. So we have very strong internally generated cash flows to fund growth projects in the future. The second part of it too is we have our partners now in KKR and ADIA, they can also be a source of capital for big projects like that. And thirdly, we can pull capital at the project level. So similar to what we've done at Cameron, we can do that with other projects too. So I'd say, as we think about the future of funding these projects, we feel very good about how we can source the capital into that growth. Jeff Martin : And I'll just maybe Craig as a final comment say, in the perfect storm you're describing, I think there will be a lot of alignment, around government agencies and support across our industry to pull projects forward as necessary. If we can to be helpful to improve the energy security of our allies. Craig Shere : One would hope our studies would be so integrated. Jeff Martin : We're in agreement. Craig Shere : Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you very much. Operator : We move to our next question from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Sunil Sibal : Hi. Good morning, folks. And -- Jeff Martin : Good morning. Sunil Sibal : -- thanks for all the clarity. Actually, I had a couple of follow-ups on the LNG discussion. It seems like the European utilities over the last few years have been evolved to taking on long-term commitments, the 20-year contracts or so. Considering that the changes we are seeing currently, has that kind of discussions opened up again? I was just curious on that. Jeff Martin : Yes. Sure. A couple of things have taken place. One is European utilities are doing several things. They are taken on longer-term contracts. Number one, you're seeing other companies make more investments in pipeline, what they call future ready pipelines for hydrogen, which is probably further along than we are in the United States. But Justin talked about really the improvement in how he's envisioning the long-term contracting environment and maybe Justin and you can just recap that in terms of the nature of the conversation you're having with counterparties currently? Justin Bird : Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. Yes, Sunil, I think you had been seeing some reluctance on the European utilities to really go out on long-dated contracts. I think a lot of that was driven by uncertainty around the taxonomy, as well as carbon tax related questions. So I think some of that overhang is still there, but I will say we're seeing a significant uptick in interest, particularly given, some of the things that we've described it, as Jeff described in the global markets. The forwards clearly currently affected by what's happening in the Ukraine. But we're still seeing significant interest in the 10 million tons that I'm talking about marketing in Europe and Asia, all of it on a 20-year basis. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Justin. Sunil Sibal : Thanks for that. And then one clarification on the one MTPA that mention for the Cameron debottlenecking. Is that capacity all spoken for between your partners in that project? Jeff Martin : So yeah, that capacity would go to the current off-takers. And so basically represent in a sense, captive customers for the marginal earnings that would come out of those additional volumes. Sunil Sibal : Got it. And then last question on that, I think you mentioned improvement in return profile on these projects. Could you give us a sense of directionally what kind of improvements that you are seeing? And I presume that contract construct with regards to the nature of the contract it's pretty much similar to what we did for Cameron. Jeff Martin : Yeah. I'll pass this to Faisel, but I think one of the things we're referring to here is the nature of scarcity that you see in the marketplace, and the growing recognition that you're seeing about the growing role of natural gas. This calls in two things to happen. Number 1, increase openness by customers to enter into long-dated contracts. And Number 2, greater competition for the capacity that we're looking to market both in the Gulf and the West Coast, and Faisel, you want to add anything in that in terms of what we're seeing, Faisel Khan : I mean, Trevor is also laid this out in his capital allocation framework, but it's targeting those mid to high teens equity levered IRR is what we look at. Sunil Sibal : Got it. Thanks for that. Jeff Martin : Thanks, Sunil. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jeff Martin : Hi, Nicholas Campanella. Nicholas Campanella : Hey, team. Hey, long time no talks. I guess, just on the California utilities and in terms of what's assumed in the broader six to eight CAGR here. I know we talked about the GRC cycle coming up. You also have cost of capital coming. Are you just kind of assuming status quo through 25/26, or how should we think about that? Jeff Martin : Couple of things for you in terms of the five-year plan. Two of those years are under the old rate case and then three of the four or five years will be covered by the rates case that goes into effect on January 1, 2024. In terms of cost of capital, we're obviously following the proceeding very closely. I think our current range for 2022 is contemplated whether the trigger mechanism applies or doesn't apply, it's contemplated in the range we viewed as having between $0.5 and $0.10 impact either way. And then in terms of the GRC assumption, as we think about forecasting in future periods, you recall [Indiscernible] convention has been to use substantially similar attrition mechanisms from the past. So if you look at the attrition mechanisms that PG&E and Edison recently got. And our average attrition mechanism across both utilities over the last five years. That's a good proxy for our expectation in the plan going forward. Nicholas Campanella : Great. Thanks a lot. And just one more cleanup question here on LNG or sorry, SIP EBITDA, you gave '22, we have earnings guidance for '22 and '23. Is there any reason why '23 wouldn't track similar to how you framed the change in earnings, from an EBITDA perspective, just trying to think about EBITDA at SIP for\u201923? Thanks. Trevor Mihalik : So the earnings for -- the earnings you see in our guidance range for '22 and '23, assumes the proportional amount of earnings, the NCI's in there. For example, in '22, you're seeing roughly 25% interest to our non-controlling shareholders. And then in '23, you're seeing 30% non-controlling interest. That's why you see a little bit of a change there. But on a gross basis, the EBITDA is basically fairly straightforward. Justin Bird : But let me just say this, the reason we just put '22 in there, there was nothing with regards to why we didn't put '23. It's largely the same. Nicholas Campanella : Yeah. Just wanted to confirm that. Thanks for the time. Really appreciate it. Jeff Martin : Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session at this time. I will turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Sure. In closing I wanted to make sure we took the time to summarize some of the highlights from today's call. We've nearly tripled our U.S. rate base in four years to $41 billion. That includes current authorized blended ROE. Today they're slightly higher than 10%. We posted record adjusted EPS results print in a number today of about $8.43. This was the 12th consecutive year that we've been able to raise our dividend. And today, we announced our long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. And by the way, over the last 10 years, we delivered a 7% to 8% annual CAGR in terms of EPS growth. I would also note that we're really benefiting from a simplified business model with three T&D platforms with scale and the biggest economic markets in North America and all of these results are being backed by shareholder-friendly repurchases; $1 billion in the summer of 2020 and another approximate $1 billion through 2023. We appreciate everyone joining the call. Trevor and Justin and our IR team will be attending the Credit Suisse Conference next week in Vail and also the Morgan Stanley Conference next week in New York. We hope we have the chance to see many of you there in person at both of those events. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donovan. Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sempra's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.  We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Lisa Alexander, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Faisel Khan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.  Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. All of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, May 5, 2022. And it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.  With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. Against the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, our company remains focused on executing our T&D investment strategy in our core markets. Sempra California is preparing to submit GRC filings at both SDG&E and SoCalGas later this month, focused on providing safe, reliable and cleaner energy to its 26 million consumers.  Turning to Texas, Oncor is executing on its record 5-year capital plan focused on critical T&D infrastructure investments across its service territory to support strong demographic growth and plans to file its rate case later this month. And at Sempra Infrastructure, they're developing a platform that's uniquely positioned to export LNG directly from the Gulf and Pacific Coast to customers in Europe and Asia.  The recent tragic events unfolding in Ukraine have highlighted the need for secure access to reliable sources of cleaner energy and Sempra Infrastructure is well positioned to be part of the solution. Our strategy of investing in T&D infrastructure to expand and modernize North America's energy systems across each of our 3 growth platforms is continuing to drive our record $36 billion, 5-year capital plan and has helped us deliver another quarter of strong financial results. Also in April, we completed $250 million of share repurchases under our existing board authorization. In the last 6 months, we've returned $750 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, which taken together with our dividend program, demonstrates our commitment to returning value to our owners while remaining focused on investing in and growing our businesses as part of the disciplined capital allocation strategy.  Shifting to our quarter results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $2.91. We're also affirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance range for 2022 and our EPS guidance range for 2023. Please turn to the next slide.  I'd now like to briefly highlight some of the key strategic advantages of our T&D portfolio. Sempra's 3 growth platforms are strategically positioned in highly attractive and contiguous markets in North America and serve one of the largest utility consumer bases in the United States. Our strong position helps create momentum for critical investments in advancing safety, reliability and cleaner energy as the global energy market continues to evolve. We also believe our platforms will play an important role in building the energy systems of the future. Please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Lisa to provide an update on our sustainable business practices. Lisa Alexander : Thanks, Jeff. I'm pleased to share that we recently issued our annual Corporate Sustainability Report for the 14th consecutive year. Sustainability is central to our strategy, capital allocation and sustained performance. Throughout our report, you'll see examples of our sustainable business practices, including how we've aligned our portfolio with long-term macroeconomic market and policy trends. Among other factors, our corporate strategy is focused on enhancing safety, climate resilience and affordability and capturing new investments in infrastructure that support increasingly diversified and cleaner forms of energy.  One of the key improvements to the report is our enhanced ESG reporting to address the evolving needs of our stakeholders in light of a constantly changing environment. We appreciate the collaboration and continue to align our reporting to track and deliver on key ESG metrics. A couple of other highlights from the report are reflected on this slide. Recently, SDG&E issued its decarbonization road map for California, the path to net zero, which demonstrates our position as a leader in helping the state reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045. It's also important to note that safety is foundational to our business. We're continuing the essential work of helping ensure employee and contractor safety and operational excellence.  For example, ECA LNG recently surpassed 1 million hours worked without a lost time injury. Additionally, customer affordability is another top priority, and we're investing in the necessary infrastructure to help mitigate operating risks and enable a just energy transition. This approach of investing in our business while striving to maintain affordability underscores our values of doing the right thing, championing people and our unwavering commitment to safety across our operations. Finally, we have a demonstrated history of sound corporate governance and oversight by our Board of Directors. The report highlights our Board's skills and experience and, among other areas, cybersecurity, energy transition and operational excellence. Our strength in sustainable business practices has been recognized by experts in the sector, including the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. And we've been named to the list for 4 consecutive years. Notably, we are the only North American utility company to be so recognized. I'm very proud of the collective effort from each of our businesses and our shared work with all our stakeholders. With sustainability at the heart of our corporate strategy, it provides a clear sense of purpose for our 20,000 employees.  Please turn to the next slide, where I'll hand the call over to Trevor to provide business and financial updates. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Lisa. We made solid progress in the first quarter with a number of positive developments at each of our operating companies. Beginning with California, we're excited about SDG&E's completion of the Cleveland National Forest Fire Hardening and Safety Project, which is an example of SDG&E's commitment to making its electric system safer and more reliable.  Next, I'd like to remind you of an important decision issued by the CPUC in February, establishing a statewide renewable natural gas procurement standard with procurement targets for California's investor-owned gas utilities in 2025 and 2030. This decision reaffirms the role of renewable natural gas in the state, and we view it as a significant step toward the future of cleaner fuels in California. Against that backdrop, SoCalGas continues to execute on its own goal of 20% renewable natural gas delivery to its core customers by 2030.  In April, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their cost of capital applications to update each of their authorized rates of return, which would be effective for 2023 through 2025. We expect a decision by year-end. Regarding SDG&E's off-cycle cost of capital application for 2022, we expect a decision later this year. For more information on the cost of capital filings, please refer to the appendix.  Additionally, both utilities plan to file their general rate cases with the CPUC in the coming weeks to update their authorized revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027. Among other considerations, our filings will focus on safety and reliability investments, while also looking to advance the state's clean energy goals. We look forward to working with the commission and all of our stakeholders on these important regulatory proceedings. Shifting to Texas. It's important to note that in 2021, it was a record year for Oncor in terms of the new and active requests for transmission interconnections, highlighting the rapid economic growth in its service territory. This growth has continued in the first quarter of 2022, with a 78% increase in new interconnection requests compared to the first quarter of 2021. Oncor's service territory continues to experience strong new commercial development and population increases as demonstrated by Oncor connecting approximately 16,000 new premises in the first quarter. Additionally, last month, Oncor's Board of Directors approved an update to its 2022 capital plan from $2.8 billion to $3 billion. While Oncor's Board typically approves the annual capital plan in October, this off-cycle approval is another example of the robust economic growth in Texas, driving investments to support transmission and distribution expansion. Also in March, Oncor received approval of its transmission cost of service filing for the recovery of its 2021 capital investments. Oncor also plans to file its rate case with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas later this month. Now let's shift to Sempra Infrastructure, which is focused on making critical new investments that support the energy transition. As part of this strategy, Sempra Infrastructure is working to export LNG directly from the Gulf and Pacific Coasts to customers in Europe and Asia. Furthermore, our U.S.-Mexico cross-border infrastructure business supports the growing integration of North American energy markets. As part of our effort to develop Cameron LNG Phase II, we've successfully reached a number of important commercial and permitting milestones and are now progressing towards the engineering stage of the project.  As a reminder, in January, we filed our amendment with the FERC to transition from gas turbines to electric drives. If approved, this would result in a more capital-efficient single train with an estimated 44% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous design. Also, last month, we signed project development agreements and an HOA with Cameron LNG partners to advance Phase 2 of the project. These arrangements provide the commercial framework for the development of a fourth train as well as increased production capacity through debottlenecking activities from the existing 3 trains.  Sempra Infrastructure contemplates taking its share of the offtake and selling it under long-term sale and purchase agreements to third parties. In summary, under the proposed arrangement, Cameron LNG Phase 2 would be fully contracted prior to reaching a final investment decision.  In addition, we selected 2 FEED contractors to run a competitive process, which is intended to culminate in a fixed-price turnkey EPC contract. The FEED process is expected to conclude in the summer of 2023, which would allow us to evaluate taking FID thereafter. We believe we have a strong plan of execution, and this detailed and rigorous FEED process will result in better scope, definition, cost and schedule for the project.  Next, as we continue to advance our dual market strategy, we broadened our alliance with TotalEnergies to advance the Vista Pacifico LNG project and to explore renewable opportunities in North America. The MOU to develop Vista Pacifico LNG contemplates that TotalEnergies would receive 1/3 of the project offtake and potentially participate in the project equity.  Given the increasing demand for LNG projects, we're continuing to have active discussions with market participants around Port Arthur LNG. As a reminder, the proposed facility at Port Arthur has advanced permitting and design work and is targeted to have total capacity of approximately 13.5 Mtpa. Lastly, at Sempra Infrastructure, we continue to expect the sale of a 10% interest to ADIA for approximately $1.8 billion to close in the second quarter, subject to customary closing adjustments and conditions.  Please turn to the next slide. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $612 million or $1.93 per share. This compares to first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $874 million or $2.87 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2022 earnings were $924 million or $2.91 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $900 million or $2.95 per share. Please turn to the next slide.  The variance in the first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be explained by the following key items : $42 million of lower earnings at Sempra Infrastructure attributable to higher noncontrolling interest, consisting of : $24 million increase as a result of the decrease in our ownership interest of Sempra Infrastructure Partners, net of an increase in our ownership interest in IEnova, and $18 million, primarily due to an increase in Sempra Infrastructure Partners' subsidiaries net income.  This was offset by $27 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to the increased revenues from the rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital, higher customer consumption and customer growth; $25 million of higher transportation and terminal earnings at Sempra Infrastructure; and $22 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E. Please turn to the next slide.  To summarize, we've continued to invest in our record capital plan to help build the energy networks of the future. We're pleased about the strength of our financial performance this quarter, and we'll remain highly focused on executing our strategy and capital program throughout the remainder of the year.  With that, this concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now stop and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Just Jeff, starting off with the LNG updates today. Can you just maybe further elaborate on the Cameron 4 timing updates? Obviously, part of the limiting element was the engineering piece. Does the latest update potential eliminate some of the future time line risk? Is this kind of the last FID delay we should expect? Jeffrey Martin : Shar, thank you for the question. I've got some feedback from some other investors there may have been portions of the script that I need to make sure that we read. Just give me 1 second to clean up the script, and we'll come back to your question, okay? Shahriar Pourreza : Sure. Jeffrey Martin : The part I'd like to review for the investment community is against the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, our company remains focused on executing our T&D investment strategy in our core markets. Sempra California is preparing to submit GRC filings at both SDG&E and SoCalGas later this month, focused on providing safe, reliable and cleaner energy to its 26 million consumers.  Turning to Texas, Oncor is executing on its record 5-year capital plan focused on critical T&D infrastructure investments across its service territory to support strong demographic growth and plans to file its rate case later this month. At Sempra Infrastructure, they're developing a platform that's uniquely positioned to export LNG directly from the Gulf and Pacific Coasts to customers in Europe and Asia. The recent tragic events unfolding in Ukraine have highlighted the need for secure access to reliable sources of cleaner energy, and Sempra Infrastructure is well positioned to be part of the solution.  Our strategy of investing in T&D infrastructure to expand and modernize North America's energy systems across each of our 3 growth platforms is continuing to drive our record $36 billion, 5-year capital plan and has helped us deliver another quarter of very strong financial results. Also in April, we completed $250 million of share repurchases under our existing Board authorization.  Now in the last 6 months, we've returned $750 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, which, taken together with our dividend program, demonstrates our commitment to returning value to our owners while remaining focused on investing in and growing our businesses as part of a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Shifting to our quarter results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $2.91. We're also affirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance range for 2022 and our EPS guidance range for 2023. So these remarks should be read together with the remarks we made earlier this morning.  And turning back to you, Shar. Based on the nature of question, I want to agree with you. Look, we're very excited about the Cameron Phase 2 project. There was a flurry of activity in the first quarter that I think gives us a lot more confidence today about that project's ability to move forward. We have estimated that by putting together 2 competitive EPC contractors, that additional time will improve the scope, it will improve the definitive detail around the engineering and help us have a better project in the long run.  And I oftentimes use and what is probably a poor metaphor, Shar, when we refer to golf, the goal is not to play 18 rounds of golf in 2 hours. The goal is to basically shoot the lowest possible score. And we've been in this business for just over 15 years. And when it comes to executing on the LNG project, all the planning upfront makes a tremendous amount of difference. So right now, we're estimating that, that EPC work will come together in the summer of 2023. And soon thereafter, we'll take FID. So I think the key takeaway really is, as you described, we've added a lot more detail to our execution plans, and the probability that this project go forward has increased significantly in the last quarter. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. Perfect. And then just, Jeff, just lastly, can you maybe just address the project development pipeline? I mean, this optionality means -- I mean, in our viewpoint, more now than it ever has, given sort of the issues you highlighted happening overseas in your prepared remarks, right? Maybe starting off with sort of the ability to deliver more capacity, is there demand for Vista Pacifico and more importantly, for Port Arthur, the engineering and permitting in relatively advanced stages, given the history of the projects? I mean, would you be able to move faster to address the market demand in terms of setting future FIDs? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, it's a great question. Let me try to take it in a couple of pieces here. I'll start at the very top and say that we're one of the few developers in the U.S. LNG community that has a shot at delivering up to 30 million tons per annum of new capacity to the marketplace. And what I'd like to do, Shar, is let me just give you a quick overview of what we're seeing in the macro environment for LNG. And then I'll pass it to Justin. And Justin, I think it will be helpful if you just start on Slide 13 and walk the audience through your entire development pipeline. But for those of you who have been following our company for the last 3 to 5 years, we've often discussed our forecast of a second wave of U.S. LNG development that would be necessary by the middle of this decade. And when you have properly functioning markets, they tend to pull forward both risk and opportunity. I think that's what we're seeing today.  In this case, with the tragic war in Ukraine, the sanctions against Russia highlights several considerations. First, today, Europe benefits from about 18 million cubic feet per day of Russian gas. And if you were being asked to replace all of that and you convert that to capacity, that would be 127 million tons per annum of new capacity that's required to supply Europe. That would be more than double. All of the existing plans are on the table in the United States LNG community.  So a couple of highlights as I thought about it is a clear takeaway is that energy security is a foundational component to transitioning toward a clean energy future. The second takeaway is European markets are clearly net short LNG in the near and medium term, and that's clearly showing up in a record strip of foreign prices -- forward prices all across the curve. And finally, strong growth continues in Asia, and over the long term, I want to emphasize that Asia remains the #1 growth market for U.S. LNG.  With these considerations in mind, I believe the U.S. LNG community is in the best position to respond to the needs of both markets, and that's why we're actively pursuing commercial arrangements with both European and Asian buyers, and that's why we've had a high number of market announcements in the last quarter. And Justin, if you don't mind, let's just walk through Slide 13 and give a comprehensive overview of the development we have underway. Justin Bird : Thank you, Jeff. Thanks, Shar. First off, to echo Jeff's thoughts, we're very pleased with the significant progress we've made on our LNG projects over the last quarter. Cameron Phase 1 is in operations and we're proud to say is producing over 100% of the volumes that we expected at this time. ECA Phase 1, again, 3 million tonnes per annum brownfield located just south of San Diego, only project to take FID in 2020. That project is on time and on budget. Technip is doing a great job there. As Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks, we have achieved over 1 million work hours without a recordable safety incident. We're very proud of our safety record. And we remain on track to begin producing LNG by the end of 2024.  Turning next to Phase 2 at Cameron. Again, very exciting brownfield expansion project, real cost advantage in the market. We talk about an additional approximate 7 Mtpa, one of which comes from the debottlenecking and approximately 6 comes from the additional train. We have made progress on all 3 of the milestones that I mentioned in prior calls. On the permitting front, FERC has published a schedule that shows they expect to issue an environmental assessment in December, which would hopefully give us the permit in the first quarter of 2023. On the commercial side, we announced a project development agreement and an HOA with our partners. We are making progress on marketing those volumes that we will take, and we should expect progress in that in the next quarter.  On the engineering side, as Jeff mentioned, we are running a competitive FEED process. And we do expect that to be completed in the summer. And as Jeff mentioned, we think that process will ensure that we have enough scope definition and engineering work to take FID.  Moving next to Vista Pacifico. Here, we're targeting up to 4 million tonnes per annum. And we recently signed the MOU with CFE in support of the project and announced a broadening of our strategic alliance with Total, who is looking at 1/3 of the project's offtake and potentially a minority equity stake. Still an early-stage project but has a strong competitive advantage as a Pacific outlet to U.S. natural gas to Asia.  Port Arthur, again, the largest project in our portfolio with 13.5 million tonnes per annum in Phase I. As you mentioned, because of its scale and advanced permitting status, we're seeing a significant renewed interest in Port Arthur, and we're advancing commercial discussions with a number of partners and key off-takers.  Also on the list, which, again, is not included in the close to 30 million tonnes that Jeff talked about is ECA Phase 2. We think this is a project that will make sense. And we're working on looking at opportunities there to bring in gas and to optimize the design of that project. So again, I think it's been a tremendous quarter. We have made tremendous progress on LNG. I'm very proud of that business line and what they've achieved. Operator : We'll take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Just obviously, a robust pipeline of LNG projects here. Maybe just -- maybe this is probably in Trevor's bucket. But as we think about financing of these projects, should we be thinking about project debt, minority equity interest and minimum equity at the Sempra level? That's part one of my question.  And then part 2, would you consider further sell-down of the SIP stake in order to fund this kind of robust opportunity, which is clearly multiples of billions of dollars over the next few years? Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Durgesh. And I'll start with part one of your question first. I think if you go back over the last 4, 5 years, we've been successful in growing our earnings per share at a CAGR of 11%. And to do that, we really reshuffled our portfolio, sold down noncore assets. And in the last 18 months, you've seen us consolidated our unregulated business under one platform.  And the reason we formed Sempra Infrastructure was we thought there was an opportunity to do 3 things : simplify the business model, consolidate those cash flows and create an investment-grade balance sheet and bring in and diversify the capital structure with a view toward highlighting value for owners. So we've notched that in the ADIA transaction at roughly an $18 billion equity value. In terms of sell-downs, I'd like to get the ADIA deal done first before we consider that. But right now, we have such a wonderful slate of growth in front of us.  We're very happy with our current 3 platforms, and we're very happy to own 70% of that business going forward. And as we go forward in time, we'll always work with our Board of Directors to look at opportunities to continue to optimize that business. But in terms of financing, one of the benefits of consolidating the IEnova platform with LNG and establish an investment-grade balance sheet is that business is now self-funded. And I thought it would be helpful, Faisel, as the CFO of Sempra Infrastructure, perhaps you could give them an example of how you think about financing these projects on your own balance sheet. Faisel Khan : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jeff. So I think you'll recall in the past that we've talked about sort of all the potential sort of levers or sources of capital that we can pull in to finance these projects. So first and foremost, Project Finance is one of the key areas we look at as we're signing these 20-year contracts with high creditworthy counterparties. I mean, PF can basically supply 50% to 60% of the capital we need.  Partner capital, we've talked about that. You've seen us execute on that with Cameron and at ECA. So if you think about 10% to 30% of an equity sell-down to some of these projects, that pulls in another slug of capital. And then when you think about what Jeff just talked about, our retained cash flows, we have strong cash flows off our existing assets. Those retained earnings definitely can be applied back into the equity needs for the project. We also have the ability to work with our partners in capital calls. So I think we have a lot of diverse sources of capital to pull into these projects.  The other thing, just to give you an example of how we're looking at Cameron, so as we think about financing that project with our partners, if you remember, Cameron has this amortizing debt capacity at the project. And so that, in itself, is creating balance sheet capacity as we go through each year. So roughly, call it, almost $0.5 billion of debt is being amortized on a proportional basis to us, so that gives us the ability to go in and create debt capacity there and finance the expansion.  So that just gives you an example, but suffice to say, we've got a lot of different areas we could pull capital of and still maintain Sempra at 70% ownership in Infrastructure. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Faisel. Durgesh Chopra : Just one quick follow-up. In your MOU with Total, you guys talked about pursuing like renewable opportunities, including offshore. Maybe just, can you talk to that a little bit? The reason why I ask that question, obviously, is one of your peers' utilities is kind in the market for sort of dropping their offshore projects. So just curious as to what you're targeting there? Is that international offshore, domestic offshore? And any other color you can provide? Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I will frame this for you and pass it to Justin for the specific response. As you recall that we built roughly a 3,000-megawatt growth portfolio of renewables that we transacted on in 2018 and 2019. And this is a business we know very, very well. Our focus in the renewable space is on selective market opportunities where we think we can produce the right types of hurdle rates. This is a very, very margin-constrained business from Sempra's perspective.  So as we think about a $36 billion capital program, our first dollars go into funding our utility growth. And inside Justin's business, we'll be very selective about the renewable opportunities that we do pursue and making sure we do it in a capital-efficient way with partners.  But maybe, Justin, you could talk about your Clean Power business and why the Total MOU has a positive opportunity for us. Justin Bird : Yes. Thank you, and thanks for the question, Durgesh. Yes, the MOU with Total and again, there were 2, one covered Vista Pacifico, the other covered looking at certain renewable opportunities in North America, really covers 2 aspects. One is Total's potential participation in some of our future renewable projects in Mexico that could service as Cal ISO well as Total asking us to look at their opportunity for offshore wind that would service California.  So as part of our broad strategic alliance with Total, look, it's a great relationship. We hope to expand it beyond LNG in other areas. And really, these are the first opportunities we're looking at. So clearly, we would look to them to potentially partner in Mexico, and I think they see the value that we can bring in a renewable project into California. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Sounds like this is more California and Mexico than were in the East Coast -- sorry, go ahead, Jeff. Jeffrey Martin : No, I was going to say thank you, but your summary of that's accurate. It's California, Mexico-focused. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : I won't ask you to go through all the LNG projects again. But just a follow-up on Cameron. So in terms of realistic time lines for both the -- for first, the debottlenecking and then the full expansion, what are realistic kind of time lines for start-up? Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I'll pass that to Justin. You can provide your response. Justin Bird : Yes. So thanks, Steve. So on the debottlenecking, we are working through the engineering process with our partners. And remember, debottlenecking may be a series of changes that we make over time. So that engineering, we're working through that. We expect that to really continue kind of through late summer, fall, and then we'll figure out the time line for bringing those things on.  Really, that is about, one, optimizing the existing production, not interfering with that, and then finding cost-effective ways to increase that capacity to that approximate one or perhaps more. In terms of Train 4, again, I think we gave a detailed outline as we move toward FID. And then when we get to the construction period, it's going to be the typical periods that you see, kind of that 4- to 5-year period. And then that's where we are for Cameron Phase 2.  As Jeff mentioned, part of the work we're doing and why the FEED process, we're definitely going to let that run its course through the summer, is that we do think we will get increased certainty on execution plans, better sense of the scope of work, the timing of the work and, frankly, reduce costs. Jeffrey Martin : The only point that I would clarify for you, Steve, too, is that these projects tend to have something in the neighborhood of a 48-month to 50-month window for construction, so once you take FID. And secondly, Justin conveyed that accurately, the debottlenecking, because it will be a series of ongoing projects which are conducted concurrent with construction, you'd expect to see the benefit of that 1 million-tonne per annum that we're targeting start to show up across multiple periods between 2024, 2025 and 2026. Steven Fleishman : And just on the buyback update, so how should I think about the buybacks that have been done relative to, I think, on the last call, you had kind of a $1 billion placeholder in 2023? Is some of this moving forward some of that? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, sure. I would say taking you back, Steve, to the Q4 call, you'll recall that we had completed about $500 million of share repurchases in December of 2021 and in January of 2022. And as part of that, we committed to a long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. I cited earlier on the call that over the last 5 years, we've grown at roughly 11% in terms of our EPS. So I'm quite comfortable reaffirming our expectation that we are quite comfortable growing this business long term between 6% and 8%.  But we indicated on the Q4 call that we would complete $1 billion share repurchase before the end of 2023. And I would just say at this point, nothing has changed as it relates to that forecast. We've simply brought forward $250 million of that targeted amount. The key takeaway from my perspective and from Trevor's perspective is we're excited to be executing our $36 billion capital program. And we view our dividend program, Steve, together with these periodic share repurchases, is a great way to return value to our shareholders along the way. Steven Fleishman : That's great. And just one follow-up to that question. So just when you look at your buybacks, you bought a lot of stock at a much lower price, which is great. And then this last $250 million actually was even done at a higher price. And I'm just -- is there any messaging to take from that, that, hey, even at $169, you have a certain view of the stock value. Or was it just more you had the cash sitting around? Or just wondering if there's any message from that. Jeffrey Martin : No, I think there's a very clear message. And you recall back when our stock was trading at a different price in Q2, Q3, Q4 of last year, we've been fairly consistent about our view of our ability to grow this business at a rate faster than our peers. And in combination, we think we have a very unique growth and income story. We thought that we were undervalued in Q4, and that's one of the reasons we put some dollars to work in the share repurchase program. And if you look at where we were trading relative to the peer group in Q4 of last year, we're just as deeply discounted at this moment in time to our peer group as we were back in Q4. So there's a strong view on this management team that this stock should trade consistent with the peer group or better. And that's one of the reasons we're very comfortable going in the marketplace to continue our share repurchase program. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse. Nicholas Campanella : So I just -- I hate to just belabor it on the LNG stuff. I just wanted to just make sure we had the project priorities right and just in terms of -- you had a lot out there. We've seen some of your competitors signing various purchase agreements. And I know you're working through multiple projects and Cameron's prioritized, but where do you just feel that you have the best momentum right now? And where should we be looking at -- what products should we be looking at for further announcements in the near term? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. Thank you for the question and we don't mind providing additional color. I think that -- I think I just want to convey that we've been in this business for close to 2 decades and we understand what it takes to get the project done. I'm very pleased that we got ECA Phase 1 moving forward in Q4 of 2020. We've made a lot of progress recently on all of our projects.  But the ones I would focus on is, number one, it's really, really important to this management team and our Board of Directors that we execute our existing capital campaign, and our largest project today is underway at ECA Phase 1. So our top priority is to execute on the existing FID that we took on that project. Secondly, we spent a lot of airtime in the last 3 or 4 earnings calls talking about Cameron expansion. It truly has a cost advantage in the marketplace. So the ability to basically add one train and effectively, with debottlenecking, 7 million tonnes per annum is a remarkable opportunity against the backdrop of the world being short LNG, particularly at this moment in time in Europe. And then beyond that, we are clearly looking at all the different opportunities around Vista Pacifico and Port Arthur. But I think the thing I always want to convey is we are very, very disciplined. And I gave a poor golf analogy earlier, but from our standpoint, it's not always a race. We think that there's a lot of value and there's a lot of customers in the marketplace that want to work with a company that has a strong balance sheet and a strong record -- a track record and is focused on doing things the right way.  So we think we have a unique position in the marketplace. We don't think about it from a speed perspective, but we think about it from executing with deliberation and the right values to make sure that we can deliver the best risk-adjusted cash flows to our investors. So right now, the focus is making sure we execute on our existing construction program, and that we run headlong toward Cameron expansion with a great group of partners. And as Justin indicated earlier, we expect to have that project fully contracted or substantially so by the end of Q2. Nicholas Campanella : Got it. That's helpful. I guess just like, Jeff, a broader kind of business mix and strategy question. You took over 3 to 4 years ago. You talked a lot about re-pivoting the company to North American infrastructure. That now seems like it's complete, the stock's responded. And I guess just how are you thinking about the portfolio today? Are there businesses that you want to be bigger in from an inorganic perspective, specifically? Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I think I made a comment earlier that we feel very good about our 3 growth platforms. And I'll tell you one of the observations that we've had in our strategy discussions with our Board of Directors, was very early in the first half of the pandemic of 2020, we realized the value in this sector of scale, right?  So as you think about the Clean Energy transition, you think about the GRC programs that are going forward in our company here in California and Texas, there's no question that putting IEnova together with LNG and have -- circling some EBITDA figure of around $2 billion was the right move with an investment-grade balance sheet. So I think one of the things we're benefiting from right now is we're in the best markets that are experiencing tremendous growth, and we've been able to put together 3 businesses at scale. So when we came out with our 6% to 8% long-term growth rate, we have a very bullish view of what we can accomplish, and it's really around the market position and scale that we have across all 3 of these areas.  And right now, as you think about inorganic opportunities, I think we can effectively take those off the table. We've got a $36 billion capital program, and our job is to execute that with discipline, and I think we're going to be in a position to outperform. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to come back to the LNG side a little bit more, if I could. And just wanted to get your thoughts, I guess, on the depth of the long-term contract market out there. We've seen Schneider Global Venture in recent months kind of sign these 15-, 20-year contracts. We saw energy transfer get over 4 Mtpa in past month or so here, in kind of that same ZIP code.  Is that -- do you see the depth of that market improving versus where it was before given what we're seeing for energy security needs as you outlined there? Just wondering, is the market there for the contract lengths that you guys want and the risk profile that you want? How do you see the market today there? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, I'll make just a quick comment and I'll pass it to Justin. Maybe, Justin, you can update them on how the type of conversations you're seeing in terms of contract tender. But I just returned to one of the things I said in my earlier remarks, which is there's no question that everyone now can see what we've been forecasting, which is this net short position in Europe. And the magnitude of what is required to back out 8 billion cubic feet per day of gas is a significant number of new capacity that will exceed even what the U.S. LNG community can provide. But Asia is a larger opportunity. So I think if you look at the opportunity in both markets, there's going to be a real demand near term and long term for more LNG facilities. And that impacts the pricing environment and the opportunity to have longer tenured contracts. But Justin, maybe you can provide a little bit of color on the conversations you're having. Justin Bird : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. Jeremy, yes, the conversations we are having are around the types of contracts that we look for at Sempra, which, again, to your point, is long-term with creditworthy counterparties. I think you are accurate. There has been a dramatic shift in the market in the recent days. Specifically, we've seen a significant amount of long-term contracts. You saw -- well, I think one in February, I think there's around 7 in March and most recently, there's been one in April. So yes, you are seeing a lot of parties, given the volatility in both TTF and JKM. And frankly, the high forwards, you're seeing a definite renewed interest in parties willing to go long term. And those are the conversations that we are having. Jeremy Tonet : Got it, that's helpful. So the type of contracts we are seeing signed out there, those are the types that would be sufficient for you guys to underpin, I guess, future moving forward with the project at this point? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, that's correct. Justin Bird : Correct. Jeremy Tonet : Got it, okay. And then maybe just want to pivot towards the offshore wind for a moment here. Just how to think about that, how that fits into the portfolio, your queue of projects. Just want to see how high of a priority that is at this point? Jeffrey Martin : I would say it's one of our lowest priorities. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And just the last one, if I could. Thinking about the state's RNG goals. There are also ongoing key pump efforts seemingly and some competition here. Just wondering how you think about the balance of electrification versus RNG in decarbonizing California at this point? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, great question. I will tell you that we've got a lot of folks inside of our company that are focused on both opportunities around green molecules and green KWs. But I think what we view is there's going to be a requirement that we transition in an orderly way toward increasing clean resources.  And we're very, very bullish on electrification. I hope we get the chance for Allen Nye to update you on some of the really large-scale electrifications taking place in the Texas marketplace. But I would also tell you there are some hard to decarbonize areas in American society, largely heavy industry, heavy transportation, some of the maritime and aviation uses of energy. So in California, there's growing recognition by the regulator and across all market participants that there's going to be a strong trend toward electrification.  But there's really a convergence between the need for green molecules to power some of that electrification and to help decarbonize. So I think the commission deserves a tremendous amount of credit for taking a forward-looking view on renewable natural gas, as an example. You may recall that over 3 years ago, we set a target for 2030 of 20% of our core customers being served by RNG. And that was well before this ever came on the radar screen for our regulator.  And now that they've adopted targets that progress over time up to closer to 12%, we feel like we're in a great position. I think we came out at around 4% penetration in our core customers at the end of 2021. And we continue to be optimistic about executing against some of the expectations of our regulators. So we firmly believe there's a role both for cleaner molecules and for cleaner electrification, and we expect to see both of those work in tandem going forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Hopefully 2 easy ones. One is I just want to make sure I understand fully, is the LNG growth platform funding even though projects maybe have been accelerated or potential to accelerate, is that still a self-funding model for the LNG growth platform? Jeffrey Martin : It sure is a self-funding model. And I think it goes back to a couple of comments I've stitched together this morning, which was we think one of the great lessons from the COVID economic environment was the importance of scale. And scale will be even more important when we think about what we need to accomplish across all 3 platforms and putting together those 2 businesses with an IG balance sheet. Our clear intention was to make sure it's a self-funded platform, and Faisel gave some examples of how we expect to do that using project-level equity, internally generated cash flows and project finance. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then just lastly, hopefully, an easy follow-up. If I think of all of the questions or most of the questions I should say on the call, they're probably mostly related to maybe the smallest piece of Sempra's overall business, Sempra Infrastructure. Is that a good or bad thing? Is it that the work that management has done over the last 2 years, where there were more questions on maybe the core business like Sempra California or Sempra Texas, that has transitioned to the smaller business. Do you view that as a good or bad thing? Jeffrey Martin : I think it's a positive. Let me explain why. Roughly 80% of our earnings mix comes from what we think are some of the best utility platforms in the United States, right? So our ability to basically grow rate base off of a $42 billion number at the end of last year at 9% going forward in our 5-year plan is a remarkable opportunity. But our ability to basically exceed expectations and grow this business faster than we forecasted really turns to our ability to how we grow Sempra Infrastructure, right?  So we're at a moment in time where across all 3 platforms inside Justin's business, that's the LNG and Net Zero solutions business, Clean Power and our energy network business. That has a chance to provide some really unique additive growth to our portfolio. So we talked a lot about our growth in the past. We've got a very strong portfolio of bond-like returns from our California platform and our Texas platform, but our opportunity to exceed people's expectations is going to rely a lot on how they execute across their portfolio in Sempra Infrastructure. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then just lastly, I think, Jeff, when you described the transition the company has been on over the years, selling South America, investing in Sempra Texas. You mentioned the word contiguous. How important is that towards the Sempra platform going forward? Jeffrey Martin : You may remember, 15 or 20 years ago, a lot of M&A in our sector was limited to businesses that were actually contiguous. That's no longer a requirement. But one of the things we think about from our strategy is how do we extract synergies and efficiencies across all 3 platforms. And at Sempra, the value of the parent company as we focus on people, process and technology to help drive the results across all 3 platforms and having a contiguous platform is really helpful. And I'll tell you, the way I view it is, a lot of people broadly diversify their businesses. They're in different markets, in different jurisdictions, but they fail to have the discipline to make sure they're extracting the benefits of diversification. In our case, we think the best way to manage risk is to go deeper in the markets that are most important. So when you think about California as the fifth largest economy in the world, Texas has moved from #10 to #9, and Mexico is currently #15 and forecasted by 2040 to be #7 in the world, what we want to do is we want to have great regulatory relationships in those marketplaces. We want to understand all the market fundamentals, and we want to make sure that we're putting together a capital allocation strategy that allows us to extract the best risk-adjusted opportunities in those markets. So one of the things I've talked about before is, we've grown this business over the last 2 decades at a 7% EPS CAGR in an industry that has grown over the same period of time at 3%. And that's not just because we're better managers. It's because we're in the right market. So this focus on being deep and committed to extracting efficiencies in each of our core markets -- and contiguity is a part of that -- is part of our winning strategy, we believe. Anthony Crowdell : Congrats on a good quarter. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : What factors influence the scale and sizing of Vista Pacifico from an Mtpa perspective? Jeffrey Martin : Thank you. We've -- I would just say that we're really excited about both ECA Phase 1, which is under construction, and Vista Pacifico. They both really leveraged the same common resource of Permian gas, and we have a straight shot through 2 different pipeline systems to support Vista Pacifico. I had the opportunity to have dinner with the President of Mexico and John Kerry a couple of weeks ago in Mexico City. And the topic of that conversation, Ryan, was how we can move Vista Pacifico along at a faster pace. In Mexico, they understand the value of being able to export some of their natural resources, particularly high sulfur oil, but they also want to make sure that they raise their marquee status as an exporter of LNG. So I'm pleased with the type of support we have across the government inside of Mexico to support that project going forward. But Justin, maybe you can talk about how you're thinking about the capacity at Vista Pacifico. Justin Bird : Yes. Ryan, as Jeff mentioned, really, Vista Pacifico will source gas from the Permian. Some of the sizing revolves around how much gas can be delivered at what rate there. We're also looking at clearly optimizing the design of the economics. It could be that we do it in 2 phases as we get additional gas transportation capacity. But again, early stage development. We will optimize the size for -- to create the best risk-adjusted returns. Ryan Levine : And then one on financing plans. It looks like most of your debt is more fixed rate in nature. But curious how you're thinking about managing the more floating rate debt, both in your current portfolio or current capital structure and then as you look to grow these different businesses? Jeffrey Martin : And are you focused more on the LNG side or you're talking about across the enterprise, Ryan? Ryan Levine : More within SIP, but to the extent there is exposure in the other division, that would be helpful. Jeffrey Martin : Sure. Faisel, please take that. Faisel Khan : Yes. Sure. Ryan, so when you're looking at sort of proportional debt across Sempra Infrastructure of close to roughly $9 billion, a lot of it is fixed rate debt and some of the debt we've -- that was floating rate that we've swapped to fixed. But we don't actually don't have a tremendous amount of floating rate exposure. So -- and I think as you've seen the move in interest rates, we haven't really seen a big impact to the bottom line. So I think as we move forward with our projects, we'll look to see what the balance is between floating and fixed, but right now, we feel like we're in a pretty good position. Ryan Levine : I think some of those [indiscernible] hedges expire in the next few years. Is the intention to continue to do swaps to lock in the fixed rate? Faisel Khan : I think -- so what we have is we have a lot of amortizing debt at Sempra Infrastructure, so I mentioned Cameron on a proportional basis. We also have our pipelines in Mexico, the ones that we have joint venture agreements with. Those also have amortizing debt. So naturally, what's going to happen is as that debt rolls off, those swaps expire. So that's kind of probably what you're seeing. But other than that, there's -- we don't have any sort of floating rate debt that's not swapped during the -- for the tenor of the security. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Jeff, just a quick question here. Going back to Port Arthur, just focused on that. How do you think about the opportunity on permitting to pivot to electric or not? I mean, basically, the thought there is -- do you -- is it desirable to go back and look at that from an electric perspective, just given the GHG benefits and sort of what that means from a contracting perspective? Obviously cognizant of your other decisions here. And maybe you could speak a little bit to the time line on that asset as well, considering where you stand? Jeffrey Martin : Right. You recall just by way of analogy, at Cameron, one of the things we did in concert with our partners was look at opportunities for us to lower our overall greenhouse gas footprint at Cameron, and that caused us to shift our filings to move to an electric drive for Cameron Phase 2. We're looking at things very similarly at Port Arthur. I think one of the unique advantages Port Arthur has is, number one, at scale and the degree that it's fully permitted across almost every aspect of the development currently. So I think the expectation would be that electric will probably be part of Phase 2 at Port Arthur LNG. And given the level of interest we have in Phase 1, we would proceed as we've currently filed. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And considering that you don't need the updates on the FERC side, time line there? Obviously, you've got this engineering work with C4 pushing into '23. Any kind of similar time line that you'd like to offer on Port Arthur Phase 1? Jeffrey Martin : We currently haven't put out an expectation for FID at Port Arthur. I would say that we are having conversations with more than 20 different counterparties related to that project and the interest is very high. But again, I think I've said it 2 or 3 times on this call, we're really committed internally to take a measured approach and be very disciplined. And if we can get that project in a box with really, really solid risk-adjusted cash flows, it's the type of project that could move forward in our time line. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry, Jeff. I didn't mean to push too much. I know we're all chomping at the bit for you to succeed here, I get it. Jeff, quickly last question. I mean, seriously. Quick last little detail, if I could throw it in there : Oncor. We haven't talked about it enough here. Prospects on settlement here, pre-settling, however you want to talk about that in the context of filing later this month? You all have done remarkably well there over the years. Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I think this might be an opportunity, if you allow me, I think we can comment on the rate case and maybe give a little bit of visibility into the growth we're seeing there. I know Allen had a remarkably positive press release they put out that tracked a lot of that. Let me just start by saying, before I pass it to Allen, Trevor and I were in Dallas last week for the Oncor Board meeting. We could not have been more pleased with the comprehensive nature of the growth they're seeing on their system. As you know in the market, they'd say the comment about don't fight the tape. There is a strong tape in Texas towards further growth. They raised their capital program from 2022 from $2.8 billion to $3 billion. And Allen, maybe perhaps we could do 2 things. Maybe you could walk folks through some of the growth you're seeing on the system because I think your examples would be helpful to people, and then get right to Julien's question about how we think about settlement, which has been the tradition at Oncor as you look at regulatory filings like this. Allen Nye : Yes, sure. Glad to. Julien, thanks for the question. Jeff, from a growth perspective, I think you described it well. What we're seeing, we put it out in our press release and then Trevor talked about it early on today. But still kind of 2% premise growth, 16,000 new premises this quarter. The real growth that we're seeing right now is transmission POIs, which, as we put in our press release, but 50% increase in active requests, 78% increase in new requests. So just a really strong transmission POI, point of interconnection, growth that we're seeing across our system right now. What we haven't talked about yet, and you mentioned it, Jeff, a little bit about electrification is what we're continuing to see in West Texas, which continues to be very strong. We've talked about our Culberson Loop, which is our transmission system that we serve the Delaware on. In December of 2021, it peaked at 800 megawatts, and in March, we're already at 845 megawatts. Far West Texas weather zone, every month in 2022 has exceeded the demand for the corresponding months in '21. And then kind of a new thing we're seeing, I haven't -- I don't think talked to you a lot before is we have another loop out there known as the Stanton Loop, which serves the Midland Basin, and we're also seeing really strong demand on that loop right now as well. So a lot of that is electrification of existing facilities. I think the next phase on that will be -- many of our customers are looking at electrifying really their entire processes. And so that's out there and still coming.  That really strong growth, Jeff, to your point, is what's driving this $200 million additional CapEx that you and the Board and Trevor did with us a couple of weeks ago. We're still at 15 over 5 on our 5-year plan. We have added $200 million to that. That's not pull forward, that's $200 million in addition. But we're not changing our 5-year CapEx outlook until we get to our Board in October. But I think you can extrapolate out if you think about the growth we're seeing here, which has been fairly consistent over a number of years now and even increasing, that there's some upward pressure on that CapEx number or opportunities going into October. That, in addition to the fact that we, like other utilities in Texas, around the country, I think, are taking a really hard look at resiliency and hardening and there may be some things we have on that coming out of October as well. So that's kind of the background on the growth in the CapEx story that we're seeing to.  Julien, to your question specifically, I appreciate the comments. I couldn't agree more. I've been around this business for about 30 years now, and we have a history and almost a tradition of being able to work with these parties down here and with our commission. And I think we'll do everything we can to do that again this year. We are going to file this case around May 11, which is our -- I think in our Q, we said unless we settle early, that puts us in new rates kind of end of third quarter -- or end the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, beginning of first quarter.  I think we have a very strong case. I think we have a really good story. We're a good company. We work with the state. We do what we're asked to. We have safe operations, reliable operations and we are the low-cost provider in the state from an IOU perspective. And we have very strong relationships with our stakeholders and I think a very good reputation with our regulators. And so all those things are going to give us opportunities to do what we've done in the past, which is work with these parties and try to reach something amicable that works for us and benefits the state and the ERCOT market. And we're doing that now. We've had some discussions already with some parties. Obviously, we haven't filed our case yet. So we'll see who all intervenes in our case. People have to have a time for discovery as they always do. And then you always try and settle these things to the extent you can around the time of intervenor testimony, obviously, before hearing. But it's a good case. I believe it's a strong case. We're looking forward to presenting it. And as history as a guide, I think you know what we'll try and do and we'll work with the parties and see what we can come up with, and I'm optimistic but we'll have to see who intervenes and what positions they take. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Allen. Allen Nye : You bet. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Congrats on a good start to the year. On Cameron, 2 questions there just on having a kind of re-up or redo or reevaluate the FEED study and getting a response back middle of next year. Just curious, how much certainty do you think you have at this point in time in terms of what Cameron -- the expansion is going to actually cost? And I say that given the updated FEED study, but honestly, given all the things happening in the macro environment with both labor inflation, commodity/goods inflation, materials, et cetera? Jeffrey Martin : Michael, we usually have a 7-limit question for LNG on our call, but we're going to take your eighth question just because of our long-standing relationship, okay? Michael Lapides : Sounds great, I'll take it. Jeffrey Martin : I'm joking with you. But we've done a lot on Cameron. This isn't something we started in the last 12 months. We've got a lot of definitive work that's been done. In fact, Cameron has benefited from a lot of the work that was done at Port Arthur over the last several years. So we're in great shape in terms of our understanding of the cost structure of that business.  I think what you're seeing us do is make sure there's a competitive process. We want to make sure that we've got a clear understanding of the schedule, all the key milestones that we need to have in place so that we can execute well. I think we have a shot to execute Cameron Phase 2 exceedingly better than how we executed Cameron Phase 1. And this additional detailed work is part of our desire to have a really clean execution plan.  So the way I would read into it is, I made this comment earlier, our confidence level in the detail of this project and the commercial viability of the project has gone up dramatically in the last 4 or 5 months. And this additional work, I think, only adds more value to the schedule and more importantly, more value to the project. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then 1 for Allen. Actually, it may be 1.5 questions for Allen. Allen, just curious, in your team's planning, kind of reliability, planning, system planning, what do you think kind of the multiyear demand growth projection is that's baked into that planning by your team? Allen Nye : Sorry, Michael. The multiyear demand growth is what you're asking for? Michael Lapides : Yes. Allen Nye : Yes. Yes, about 1.5% consumption. Michael Lapides : Got it, okay. And just curious, there's an interesting docket underway or proceeding, I don't know what to call it, at ERCOT right now talking about what's happening with both data centers and even crypto mines. And that is a 5 to 6 gigawatts in a 70-something gigawatt market of incremental demand, some in front of the meter or some behind the meter in the next, like, 24 months. Just curious how you think that ripples through both that 1.5% demand projection but also just broader market reliability, system needs, regulation, et cetera. Allen Nye : Yes, Michael, it's a really good question. And I'll tell you, we spend a lot of time on it. And I can tell you, we are seeing what you would expect we'd see with those type of numbers being thrown around. I'm glad, I'm encouraged that ERCOT and the commission probably are going to look at this because it's a very interesting load, right? Now I like load. I like new customers and I like big customers. And so that's a good thing. How those customers integrate and operate on the system and the amount of generation they require, electrons they require, I think, is an important issue for the state. But we are seeing a high level of large customers, right? I mean, some of those have been publicly announced, the TI plant in Sherman, the Samsung plant in Taylor, which are different, obviously, not crypto or data center-related.  But we're also seeing a large number of 50-, 100-, 200-megawatt customers coming to us and wanting to get online very rapidly. And a lot of that is reflected in some of our transmission POI numbers. And a lot of that hasn't been reflected yet, is still to come. But it will, if it manifests, results in, obviously, discussions we have with our Board going into October on CapEx, depending on what we actually see coming out of those.  And again, I think it's great that the state is looking at it. I think it's a very interesting load because it can manifest very rapidly, right? It's not like building a manufacturing facility. You can put up a crypto facility very quickly. And so that impacts our ability to get to you quickly. And then you can also potentially move quickly if market conditions change. And so I think it's an important issue for the state, and I'm glad they're looking at it. And we're obviously looking at it very closely as well from not only a CapEx and operation perspective but what it would do overall to ERCOT. Jeffrey Martin : Michael, I would also add to that, that we go back and think about the last time Allen settled a rate case, which was in November of 2017. At that time, they had a forward 5-year capital program of $7.5 billion. And in the last 4 years, it's doubled to $15 billion. And based upon what Trevor and I saw at last week's Board meeting and some of the feedback that Allen has given us, this has all been done around the idea of meeting new load growth.  But today, that load growth is continuing, and we're now looking at the prospect of adding in what Allen described earlier, which is more spending around resiliency and obsolescence to make sure that we can integrate all these different loads. So my basic thesis here, Michael, is being in the right markets, really good markets with good regulatory jurisdictions and solid growth is a great way to outperform your peers, and Oncor is a great example.  And I'll tell you, Allen and his team are running a great program. And I think as we get toward October, not only would they be prosecuting their rate case and hoping that, that will be settled, I think we're going to be looking at increased capital spending. That's one of the reasons they've been running their equity layer at around 45% instead of 42.5% headed into this rate case. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : So I have a sort of a big picture question, and I apologize if you guys talked about it but I missed it. But as you know, perennially, there's this concern that's raised by manufacturers about the price of natural gas and LNG's potential impact on it. And given this robust outlook for LNG exports and also you guys sell off natural gas. And obviously, you guys look at this in a pretty big way, and a pretty detailed way I'm sure.  And it's dynamic. So there's the potential for supply increases, et cetera in relation to prices. So I was just wondering when you see all this opportunity, and you see domestic needs and everything and supply, what do you think the impact would be on -- what's the long-term sort of outlook you guys have on natural gas prices in the U.S., given this LNG -- robust LNG outlook that you see? Do you follow me? Jeffrey Martin : Look, Paul, it's a great question. And obviously, there's been a lot of moving forces going across the supply and demand marketplace, both for oil and natural gas and even in electricity in some markets. Markets like Europe have a lot of gas on the margin -- markets for electricity. But I would say that you've got about a 6.5 to 7.5 Bcf per day marketplace that we export to Mexico. And you've also got this 11 or 12 Bcf marketplace as we export LNG around the world. So that's about 20 Bcf per day. And what's interesting is, on a relative basis, Henry Hub has been -- has not had a lot of price volatility relative to the markers you usually see for natural gas in Europe at TTF or JKM.  So long term, remember, there hasn't been a lot of investment over the last 5 years from the oil and gas sector in new sources of delivery. And I think you're going to continue to see market forces continue to come back in and raise the rates of production as necessary to meet demand. So I can't give you a definitive forecast. It's something that we follow closely. But we're very confident about the level of natural gas resources in the United States, and the United States being best positioned to meet the growing demand for both Asia and for Europe. There is a DOE study that I would refer you to. In the DOE analysis, they talk about the United States' ability to supply these different markets over the next 20 years, and that might be a good resource for you to reference. Paul Patterson : I think I've seen it maybe. I just was wondering if you thought that, that -- you think that those assumptions and everything still apply given -- I haven't looked at it in a while, I think, but if it's the same one we're talking about. But you think those things, if I understand you correctly, are pretty much, pretty much intact even with this more robust potential outlook that you see? Jeffrey Martin : I think that's fair, and I would also -- I think that's fair. And I'd also remind folks that because we're T&D focused, as we look at launching these various LNG projects, you remember, Cameron was a tolling project. ECA Phase 1 is a project where we don't take any commodity risk because you're buying at an index and you're selling at an index.  So in terms of shielding our projects, the way you do that is you make sure you got long-term contracts with good credit counterparties and you make sure you're not taking commodity risk. But in terms of the larger macroeconomic picture, I would refer you to that DOE study, which tends to indicate the conclusion you just described. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Martin for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey Martin : Look, I just want to stop and thank everyone for joining today's call. We look forward to seeing you all at the upcoming AGA Conference in Florida later this month. Feel free, per custom, to reach out to our IR team with any additional questions, and this concludes today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Sempra Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Sempra's second quarter 2022 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and other members of our senior management team. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, August 4, 2022. And it's important to note that the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Glenn, and thank you all for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.98 and year-to-date 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $4.90. Based on the strength of these results, we're now guiding to the high end of our full-year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range, and we're also affirming our full-year 2023 EPS guidance range. Next, let me offer some perspectives on how we think about the future. At Sempra we've worked hard to simplify our business model, to improve safety and operations then with the benefit of more disciplined capital allocation to also improve our financial performance. Today we have built three large scale growth platforms operating in some of the largest energy markets in North America. Within these platforms, we have an exciting opportunity set. Here is a quick summary. At Sempra California, we're making capital investments to continue improving safety, reliability and sustainability. Each are key components of our recent GRC filings. At Sempra Texas, we couldn't be more excited about the work Oncor is doing to support strong economic and demographic growth and the continued integration of cleaner renewable resources. At Sempra Infrastructure, there are significant growth drivers across all three business lines. LNG and Net Zero solutions, clean power and energy networks. In the first half of this year, the United States became the number one global exporter of LNG. And by the end of the decade we expect the United States will extend it significant leadership advantage in this area. In combination, these investment opportunities support our record $36 billion capital plan for 2022 through 2026, as well as our continued confidence in our projected 6% to 8% annual average long-term EPS growth rate, which we announced earlier this year. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide several business updates. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. Beginning with Sempra California, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their general rate cases with the CPUC in May to update their authorized revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027. These comprehensive filings represent a thoughtful effort to support our customers by striking the right balance between maintaining customer affordability and making the necessary infrastructure investments for safer, cleaner and more resilient energy systems. Notably, both utilities have outlined the critical areas of investment needed to safeguard their systems and support the states clean energy goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. As an example, SDG&E's GRC filing is centered around investments, such as wildfire mitigation, system hardening, EV infrastructure and innovative technologies to modernize our electrical system. For SoCalGas, investments in pipeline safety and integrity and emissions reductions are key priorities in its application. Support for these rate case priorities will lead to a cleaner energy system and provide long-term benefits to our customers. We look forward to working with all stakeholders on these proceedings to advance a positive outcome. In April, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their cost of capital applications to update their respective authorized rates of return for 2023 through 2025, and we expect a final decision by year-end. To further support grid resiliency, the CPUC approved SDG&E's four new micro-grid facilities. These new energy storage projects are expected to improve power continuity during grid outages and are great examples of the critical investments SDG&E is making to integrate renewables while enhancing reliability for its customers. Additionally, SoCalGas recently announced that since 2015 had achieved a 37% reduction, a fugitive methane emissions, significantly ahead of the state's goal of a 20% reduction by 2025 and nearing the state's goal of a 40% reduction by 2030. This achievement is significant and demonstrates SoCalGas's focus on helping to accelerate the decarbonization of California's energy systems. Shifting to Sempra Texas, Oncor continues to benefit from its demographic growth and strong economic expansion across its service territory. As a result, Oncor has added another 35,000 new premises so far this year. We continue to anticipate maintaining an annual premise growth of approximately 2% in the near term, which is significantly above the industry national average. Also, Oncor has seen more than 70% increase in new requests for transmission interconnections compared to the second quarter of 2021. This highlights the continued growing demand and expected penetration of renewables in their service territory. On top of significant organic growth, Oncor continues to experience near record high temperatures. And in recent weeks ERCOT has set new records for peak electrical demand. As a grid operator, Oncor has been doing its part to help, maintain grid reliability during these extreme weather events, while also executing against a record $15 billion capital plan for 2022 through 2026. Given Oncor significant growth across its service territory, we expect their CapEx program will again be adjusted this fall. As it has done in the past, Oncor will present its updated rolling five-year capital forecast to the Board at their October meeting. In May, Oncor filed its rate case with the Public Utility Commission of Texas requesting a 4.5% revenue requirement increase over current adjusted rates to support Texas's rapid growth trends and need for continued reliability. The new rate is expected to go into effect in the first quarter of 2023. Oncor looks forward to working in partnership with its stakeholders to achieve a positive outcome. Now, I will turn the call over to Justin to discuss updates at Sempra Infrastructure where we've successfully reached a number of important commercial milestones this quarter. Justin Bird : Thanks, Trevor. Last year, we formed Sempra Infrastructure to be a leading North American infrastructure platform with a standalone investment grade balance sheet. This has enabled us to attract strategic investment partners like KKR and ADIA while also highlighting the growing equity value of the business. In June, we were pleased to close our 10% sale to ADIA for approximately $1.7 billion, with an implied equity value of close to $18 billion. We look forward to a strong partnership with ADIA and together with KKR we are working collaboratively to advance our strategy of providing cleaner and more secure energy to global customers. Jeff talked earlier about the growth that we're seeing in all three business lines at Sempra Infrastructure. But what I thought would be helpful is to focus my time on recent developments in U.S. LNG. Please turn to the next slide. Sempra Infrastructure's U.S. LNG development portfolio has made significant strides. As we outlined in our last quarterly earnings call, the key work streams that Cameron LNG Phase 2 include completion of our pending FERC amendment, the competitive FEED process and ongoing marketing. With regard to our recently announced commercial arrangements at Cameron, we have worked hard to align our economic and commercial interests with those of our customers. You will recall that we plan to take our 50% share of the trained for offtake and sell it back-to-back to global counterparties under long-term sale and purchase agreements. We are pleased to confirm that we have substantially achieved this marketing goal, as a result of the HOAs with the Polish Oil & Gas Company and INEOS, which includes the optionality to move volumes between Cameron LNG Phase 2 and Port Arthur LNG. Turning to engineering, we are running a competitive FEED process with Bechtel and JGC-Zachry joint venture. This is expected to be completed in the summer of 2023. At which time, we would expect to move to FID. Next, let me discuss Port Arthur LNG. Similar to Cameron, we have maintained a disciplined marketing approach with a focus on linking U.S. natural gas production with some of the leading European buyers of LNG. This strategy has served us well in the current environment, given supply disruptions in Europe. Just as a reminder, we have a FERC order and a DOE expert permit in hand and the permitting and design work are highly advanced for the initial phase of the project. The key remaining work streams involve finalizing of the EPC contract with Bechtel to include updated pricing and signing definitive offtake arrangements. Since our Q1 earnings call, we have entered into HOAs with RWE, the Polish Oil & Gas company and INEOS and announced a strategic partnership framework with ConocoPhillips, under which Conoco would receive roughly half of the offtake volumes or 5 MTPA under a 20-year tolling type arrangement and potentially make a 30% equity investment in Phase 1. Importantly, these announcements mark substantial progress in the marketing phase of this project. As it moves forward, we will continue to work with stakeholders, including customers, contractors, debt holders, equity investors and credit rating agencies. The positive takeaway from this, is we continue to see great interest from European buyers and volumes are coalescing around projects that have the greatest probability of advancing. We look forward to updating you on future progress in November on our third quarter call. As Jeff mentioned earlier, the U.S. has recently become the number one global exporter of LNG. Based on the quality of our development sites and their geographic positioning relative to Europe and Asia, we believe our business can help advance America's leadership position in this area, while also providing energy security to our allies and helping facilitate the global energy transition. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call back to Trevor to discuss Sempra's financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results, earlier this morning we reported second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $559 million or $1.77 per share. This compares to second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $424 million or $1.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2022 earnings were $626 million or $1.98 per share, which compares to our first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $504 million or $1.63 per share. On a year-to-date basis, 2022 GAAP earnings were $1,171 million or $3.70 per share. This compares to year-to-date 2021 GAAP earnings of $1,298 million or $4.24 per share. Adjusted year-to-date 2022 earnings were $1,550 million or $4.90 per share, which compares to our year-to-date 2021 adjusted earnings of $1,404 million or $4.58 per share. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the second quarter of 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following. $48 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to customer and consumption growth and increase in invested capital. $41 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas, as well as higher FERC margin at SDG&E. And $33 million of higher earnings at Sempra Infrastructure. There are a number of items driving this variance, so please refer to the appendix for further detail. Please turn to the next slide. As we close our prepared remarks, let me give you a couple of key takeaways. First, comparing the financial results from the first half of this year to the same period in 2021, we posted adjusted earnings growth of 10% and adjusted EPS growth of 7%. It's equally important to note that we have accomplished these results even with the sale of a 30% minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure. Second, the steps we've taken to diversify and strengthen SI's capital structure came at an opportune time, and have put us in an improved position to execute on a new set of exciting development opportunities, particularly in the LNG space. Third, going forward, we remain highly focused on safety and operational excellence. By executing on our strategy, which includes progressing towards constructive GRC outcomes at Sempra California, extending and improving electric grid resiliency in Texas, while Oncor works with its stakeholders to finalize a constructive base rate case for its customers and achieving further milestones in our overall development pipeline at Sempra Infrastructure. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. So, I will now stop and we can open the line to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hi guys. Good morning. Jeffrey Martin : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Just - you obviously you're guiding now to the top end, and it appears you're tracking well ahead of plan especially with some of the commodity optimization upside. How are you thinking about, I guess, the cadence of further updates on '22 as we think about the rest of the year? And then just more importantly, how are you sort of thinking about '23 update especially as we're now bridging to a higher '22 base or there is some of the recurring benefits that you anticipate taking into '23 like maybe O&M pull forward any other optimizations? Jeffrey Martin : Well, we appreciate the questions, Shar. I would start by just reflecting on the fact that over the last decade, we've grown our earnings per share at roughly an 8% CAGR. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks that we continue to expect the average annual long-term adjusted EPS growth rate to be in the range of 6% to 8%. And I think, we're fairly excited about being ahead of plan for the year, I think that's the right characterization. And given the strength of our results in the first half plus some of the opportunities we itemized in our prepared remarks, we certainly think that sets us up for a continued very, very strong growth in income story. We're obviously guiding to the high end of the range for 2022. And I would note, Shar, this is the fifth time in six years that we've guided to the high end of the range or increased our guidance. So we feel like there will be some pull through in 2023. And as we head into our Q3 call, we should be in a better position to give you a more definitive update. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. That helps as we're bridging. And then just Port Arthur is now optically oversubscribed, just given the advanced stage of Port Arthur 1, and did the expansion - I guess, what are the hurdles to putting in FID timeline for us? Like if EPC is done, would it be feasible to finalize commercial agreements in a relatively short time, you like maybe mid-'23 along with Cameron 4? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. I would tell you that one of the ways we're thinking about RFID decision, I know, Shar, you may have followed us, there is a lot of interest in our San Diego Padres over the last couple of days. And to use a sports metaphor, some people talk about playing smaller ball. Moving runners around the bases and that's exactly what Justin and Faisel and the team are doing in our LNG business. Let me just start by kind of characterize and where we're at with Cameron expansion or what we refer to as Phase 2, and I'll get right to Port Arthur to get at the heart of your question. First at Cameron, we're continuing to move forward on definitive commercial agreements with our partners, namely move into SPAs. We're continued to advanced permitting and we're making progress on the competitive FEED works. We expect to complete those work streams in the middle of next summer and assess an FID decision thereafter. At Port Arthur, we're not prepared to set an expected FID date yet, but I can confirm there are scenarios where FID could occur in 2023 and even in the first half of 2023. We've had some exciting developments, I think as you correctly noted using optically kind of subscribed at least Phase 1 through a series of HOAs. The next steps for us is make sure we convert those to SPAs. A lot of times buyers as you know, we want to secure their interest in the facility and move quickly to an HOA in fall with an SPA thereafter. Secondly, it's very important work we have underway with Bechtel. We've already started our partnership conversations with ConocoPhillips. We think they'll be very, very helpful with us, as we evaluate and optimize that FEED process. Then thirdly, we're advancing our financing another development activities. So there is no question from our perspective, Shar, that is an exciting project. Our goal at this point is to manage the work streams, I just described in a way that maximizes the projects value for our shareholders and it will be in a better position on the November call to give you a more definitive update. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. Then just, Jeff, one last quick one is obviously there is multiple projects that are advancing in parallel path. Just want to get your reiteration that, just given the ways you've been able to finance these projects, maybe some incremental debt capacity that you see this as being an equity free build out, as you go through the growth opportunities at the LNG business? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. I will tell you that Faisel and Trevor and Sandeep and Justin, team have spent a lot of work around this. And I give them credit because we've made as you followed a series of strategic moves to not only form Sempra Infrastructure, with the standalone balance sheet and diversified capital structure. But this the steps we took in the last 18 months also gives us a lot of flexibility. So let me give you a couple of ideas that we've outlined previously about how we expect these projects. First, as you know, we can always use non-recourse financing. You've seen the team do this on Cameron 1 through 3 and on ECA. Second, as we've done in the past, we can sell down project level equity to our off takers. This is our current plan with ConocoPhillips, Justin made this comment earlier, but we're expecting to take a 30% equity interest in Port Arthur. And I would also mention, Shar, we may also look to bring in other equity partners at the project level in Port Arthur. Third, Sempra Infrastructure is rated as an investment grade credit, this was an important development for us with significant cash flows, and this gives us another great option to access the debt markets. And then I would say fourth with the inclusion of KKR and ADIA in the capital structure, it provides us with other third-party sources of capital and it probably doesn't surprise you to know that we're also routinely taking quite a lot of reverse inquiries from other third parties to participate in our projects. So our goal as we move forward in the development process for Cameron Phase 2 and Port Arthur Phase 1 is to make sure we're evaluating all these options through the lens of getting often really high quality project and also through the lens of making sure it creates the most value for our owners. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. Fantastic guys. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue. Appreciate it. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Shar. Operator : And we'll take our next question David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Martin : Good morning, David. David Arcaro : Hi, good morning. Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the CFE news of late, and maybe on one hand could you just talk about the Pacifico project, how does the agreement that you've got in place they're now help move that project forward incrementally? And then I'm also curious on the Salina Cruz LNG terminal site. Just any other details you might be able to give, it's early stage in terms of size, strategic appeal in competitiveness timing, et cetera? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. If I understand your question correctly, I think we kind of summarize some of the recent developments with CFE, kind of our views on that marketplaces, some of these newly referenced projects. So I would start with saying, we have very constructive relationships in Mexico. Tania Ortiz does a wonderful job in Mexico. And I've had the benefit probably in the last 90 to 100 days meeting with the President of Mexico three different times about how we continue to grow that relationship and better serve that country. So I think big picture in the short term and long term, and we think they'll need additional investment, particularly in the energy infrastructure space. And David, because of the size of our existing energy network, we think it's well positioned as anybody to help meet some of the new investment needs of that country. There is a list of SI's development project summarized in the appendix at Slide 13, by way of references I go forward. But on a couple of projects you mentioned, we recently signed up the commercial terms for us to reroute the Sonora pipeline around the Yaqui territory. There is still some work to be done by the Mexican government to resolve issues with the indigenous people. So we think that's an important step. Vista Pacifico is a very interesting project is on around that 3 million ton per annum stage, is accessed by two existing pipelines. It's always a nice attribute, when you can work with the government to make sure you secure your land concession, your local, state and federal permits. And we're also having conversations with CFE to do a capacity release, so we have access to the type of volumes of natural gas we need to build that project. And that's something we think that the government of Mexico is constructive on and we're going to continue to work forward on a development basis. As to Salina Cruz, one of the things that's interesting as we think about the root causes of migration is that the estimates of Mexico, which is about a narrow waste at the Southern part of the country that's just over 200 kilometers to 250 kilometers in width. There's a lot of interest to create in an industrial quarter there. I think the President of Mexico is hoping to create 10 different industrial zones, and they're trying to find a way to bring natural gas down the Gulf Seaboard, so they could have a potential for an LNG opportunity on the Gulf side, as well as an LNG opportunity on the Pacific. Because we have such a strong position in U.S. Gulf Coast LNG today, we have been far more interested in the Salina Cruz facility, that facility would also very similar to Vista Pacifico, ECA Phase 1 provide a unique geographical access to the Asian markets with on sea transfers taking about 11 days to reach that marketplace. It's very early stage, David, but I think what it really goes to is our ability to work with various administrations in Mexico because our baseline approach is to make sure we put dollars down there in the country. Number one, we do it selectively. Number two, we tie it to raise in the standard of living for the Mexican people. And number three, we tend to try to do it in cooperation with the government, so we're also meeting their stated policy objectives. David Arcaro : Excellent. Thanks. Very helpful. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you. David Arcaro : Separate question, I was curious, I know it's early in the process, but in Texas in terms of the rate case, any thoughts on the prospects of settling that case here? Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I would say similar to our California utilities, I just start-off, let's say in the Oncor you recall, filed its base rate application in May with a view toward reaching a final regulatory outcome later this year. But we've got Allen with us on the call and Allen perhaps it would be helpful, if you just provide some additional color around the process as we move forward from today to get to a good outcome that benefits the rate payers of Texas. Allen Nye : Yes. You bet, Jeff. Thanks for the question. As Jeff said, let me just start by saying kind of where we are and then I'll get to where I think we're going. Jeff said, we filed in May, right now we're in the discovery phase of the proceeding, so we've been asked quite a few RFIs we're responding to them now. Kind of some important dates that are coming up, discovery will end on our direct case on the 22nd of this month. Intervenor testimony is due on August 26. And then staff testimony would be due on September 2nd, with a hearing on the merits, only if it's necessary obviously September 26 through October 5. So that's kind of where we are right now. Now where we're going and you know, I've said on these calls, many times over the last five years or so. We have a very strong reputation in Austin and that strong reputation is built over years and years of doing the right thing and being able to get along and work with our constituents and our state and staff and find solutions for difficult problems including rate cases. And so we have a history of finding good outcomes, these rate cases that benefit our customers and our state ERCOT market in our company. It's always important in rate cases, it's essential really to allow the interveners to have time to analyze your filing, our filing and to ask the appropriate questions that they need to do that analysis, and that's what we're doing now. However, we are in constant communication with all the parties in our case. And we will very soon, once they have asked the questions they need to ask, engage them in serious settlement negotiations, and we have done in the past, we know how to do it. It's not easy. But we're going to work very hard to try and figure out something that benefits us in the state and our customers. And that will be over the next few weeks or months. So by the time we get back in October, I suspect we'll have a lot more to talk about one way or the other. But that's kind of where we are now, where we're going, I feel very good about our case, I feel very good about our relationship. I feel very good about our history in the manner in which we engage these stakeholders in these settlement discussions. And we'll work very hard to try and make that happen in the near future. But right now, we're still in the discovery phase, so that's kind of a summary of where we are. Thank you. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Allen. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Appreciate all the color. Thanks so much. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you. Operator : I will take our next question from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Martin : Good morning, Nick. Nick Campanella : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Nice to hear from you. I guess, what - I'll keep the question with Allen. And Oncor, we've seen a lot of folks and service territory to adjacent years, kind of talk up their load forecast. And I know that the Board meets an updated capital plan higher on virtually every year, but is there anything kind of specifically discrete and different about this year versus prior years when we're kind of thinking about the magnitude of what's needed for the system here? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, it's a great question. I will frame it two different ways and pass it to you Allen. I think it might be helpful, if we just move to some of the growth drivers that you've been seeing in your marketplace, number one. And Nick, the reason that's important is, I think there is an expectation that the current $15 billion capital program when it gets revisited on the Board with Trevor and I, later in the fall, it has an opportunity just to meet growth for that budget to be increased. I don't want to get ahead of our Board decision on that. But secondly Allen, maybe talk about the work that your team is doing beyond just meeting capital growth and how that might play into the fall? Allen Nye : Yes, Jeff, I appreciate the question again. And I'll start with just, what we're seeing on the growth side to your point. The state continues to your point, Nick, see just very high demand for our services and very strong growth, both organic and demographic growth. We're still seeing 1,500 people a day move here, we are seeing corporate relocations now, the most Fortune 500 companies in any state. And we're seeing just really large industrial expansions like Samsung in Taylor, TI, GlobiTech and Sherman, things like that. So our kind of growth statistics, I know, are covered in our earnings release and Trevor mentioned them as well in his presentation, so I'm not going to go into detail there. But suffice to say, we are on a very strong path on as far as premises go, include - independent of what we have in our press release just a couple of other factors. In June, we received the largest request for service to new subdivisions in our Company's history, so that's one. And then two, for July, our serve new request are up about 40% above what we had in our forecast which were already very strong. So the outlook on the premise side is very positive, transmission POIs as stated in our materials are at historic record highs. And then we continue to see just incredible demand out west and need for investment as we continue to see new peak after new peak on our Culberson Loop, on the Far West Texas weather zone and then very, very similar growth at Culberson on our Stanton area, Stanton Loop, that serves the Midland basis. So switching back from that to the CapEx, those are some of the things that are going to be in our minds and then we're going to discuss with our Board going into October. And you all know, we do these updates in October and to Jeff's point, we've been already working very hard on that. And so why, yes, we're going into October is kind of traditional load growth, the growth of the state of Texas, all the things we traditionally talked about on these calls. I think what would make this one potentially slightly different. And Jeff alluded to it is, I think we are going about the exercise this year and the team has been working very hard on this. On seeing - given some of the extreme weather that we've been seeing over a period of years now from Yuri to all the things we're going through an ERCOT this summer. We feel we have a real need, it's really necessary that we look at and try to figure out how we can harden our system and make it more resilient. Then so I know many of the utilities are doing the same exercise, some of already announced some things. But that's the other piece of what we have kind of on our plate going into the October Boards. We'll have the traditional growth, which is already causing pressure on our plan. But then we have the other piece, which is what do we want to do to try and ensure that we provide the best customer service, the most reliable service that we can to our customers, given some of these extremes shifts and weather that we're seeing and just the need to address that on our system. So yes, our October Board meeting will probably be a little more expansive, when we talk about CapEx than it has been in the past. And I think that's potentially going to create a lot of opportunities for investment on our system. Thanks. Nick Campanella : Thanks a lot. That's great. I guess just more a capital allocation question to is, you've have this - you put a six to eight plan out there in the beginning of the year and realized a lot of momentum on this LNG business since then. And as you kind of think through all these financing considerations, should we still be thinking about the same level of buybacks here that was outlined on the fourth quarter '21? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, Nick, I appreciate that question. It's something that Trevor and I've talked a lot about is something we'll continue to have conversations with our Board about. But I would give you a couple of takeaways here. One is buybacks and dividends have been a foundational part of how we thought about capital allocation for a long period of time. Since last summer, that we've had roughly $1.25 billion of shares had been repurchased at a price of roughly $1.32. And at the term, at each juncture across the way we viewed our stock as being undervalued and repurchases, Nick, as an effective tool to create value for owners. Given where our stock is trading today, I will be very clear, we continue to believe our stock is undervalued, particularly given the growth opportunities, we've outlined on today's call and in some of our materials relative to our peer group. That's why as we go into the fall, Trevor will lead the team in revisiting our overall capital allocation strategy to evaluate our opportunities for share repurchases in the future, but he will also evaluate those options, again some of the new capital projects that we likely expect to move into our investment horizon. This exercise, Nick, has done every fall with a view toward driving maximum long-term value to our shareholders. Nick Campanella : Alright. Appreciate that. Have a good day. Jeffrey Martin : Thanks, Nick. Operator : We take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Martin : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good afternoon, Jeff. Pleasure, thank you. So, Jeff, let me clean up on a couple of things here, if there is at least another baseball metaphor here. Just with respect to taxes in IRA legislation here, any thought about AMT and how that breaks up across the businesses here? If you can just super brief here, I get as preliminary? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. Obviously the bills and draft, we think it will go through a variety of changes. We certainly like the support for the EV market. We certainly like the fact that there is an opportunity for the 45Q subsidy to go up. Streamlining, permitting has been raised this bill, it may be separated Julien as part of a companion bill. We think that makes all the sense in the world. In terms of the minimum book tax issue, Trevor, you go and just kind of address how we're looking at that. Trevor Mihalik : Sure, Jeff. Hi, Julien. Hi look on the initial assessment of what we're looking at right now, we think the earnings impact will really be de minimis or non-existent on an earnings standpoint. And then from a cash tax impact, we think there may be a real slight cash tax impact but very manageable. So I think overall, we think the way it's drafted right now, it's very easy to work through the - Jeffrey Martin : And we looked at, Julien, against our $36 billion capital program and whether the bill goes forward, it doesn't go forward, we don't see it having a material impact either way. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you for being clear about that. And just going back to Port Arthur here, again we're just trying to sharpen our pencil a little bit. And I get that it's preliminary around your conversations with Bechtel and any number of other parties here. But how do you think about the cost of that project here again? We're looking at a backdrop inflationary in a holistic sense obviously greenfield site. Any updated sense at all, just to kind of frame the value proposition here? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, I'll give you two things to think about, because we haven't publicly announced calls either for Cameron or for Port Arthur, but Cameron because it's a bit brownfield project, it will also have some debottlenecking benefits associated with it. We think it's going to be the one of the lowest per unit cost projects built in the world. Now, obviously we need to get some work done here, it's still a competitive process. We feel very, very good about the cost structure of that is in addition to the base project. At Port Arthur, it's a greenfield project, the good news both of these are in the Gulf. Then you can kind of look at comparables of what other things are caused in the Gulf region. But the good news is, we've got a world-class EPC contract we're working with. I could not be more excited about our relationship with ConocoPhillips at a call with Ryan Lance, yesterday, their CEO. I think they've done 12 different LNG projects in the world. They're going to bring a lot of value and expertise to our partnership, I think between us and ConocoPhillips and Bechtel, we have an opportunity to get to the right cost structure. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So leaning on your partners here for some of that. And if I could do that and just when you think about the SPAs and then just lining this up for even the first half of '23 as you alluded to a moment ago. When do we need to start to see that announcement, I mean, it seems like you also have some equity sell downs coming. Is that part of the update this fall here that you kind of alluded to when you think about putting everything together, Trevor, maybe? Trevor Mihalik : No, I think what we talked about is, we've got a series of work streams underway at Cameron, those were extremes a little bit more discrete. We've got a fair amount of work to be done yet on Port Arthur. And I think what we're saying is, we probably could not be more excited just in, I mean, Julien about where we're at right now, this far in the year about Port Arthur. But I think we've got enough work streams ahead of us what we want to do is choreographed that through the lens of creating a lot of value. And I just want to make this comment to which is, we're running this business for utility shareholders, right. So we have a defined view about our strategy, investing in T&D type assets that have low risk. And there is a lot of other opportunities in LNG space for people that won't be commodity expose or take construction risk. Our job is to make sure that we risk-adjust these projects and put those cash flows in the box, it looks substantially similar to our utility cash flows. And that's the type of work the team will be doing as they choreograph those work streams to make sure we come back later in the fall, we can give our investors a very clear view of how we expect to execute. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Thank you guys. Just an LNG on the mind. Jeffrey Martin : You're right. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alex Kania : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just another one on LNG, any other discussions about maybe potentially an electrifying the terminals. Do you see that a little bit is a kind of a benefit as you're talking to European parties off-takers, petro off-takers, is that important to them? And then maybe if you could elaborate a little bit more just in terms of how you think about the CCUS and development? You mentioned that the tax credit would be - higher tax rate is obviously a good thing, but maybe just thinking about permitting and such being a little bit onerous right now, do you think there may be a way through permitting reform to simplify that as well to make that kind of more kind of more likely potential? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. Thank you for those questions Alex. I will address the first part of your question and pass it to Justin, to talk about some of the carbon sequestration opportunities. But let me go back to some basics here. A little bit over 15 years ago, Sempra was a big energy company, right, a big commodity desk. And I think one of the things we've tried to focus on as part of our strategic work with our Board of Directors, particularly over the last five years - transition to an infrastructure company. And we have a decided view that infrastructure, namely continued investment in the grid and network will be a big part of how we support North America's continued economic expansion. And what we like about it, Alex is, is a lower risk profile as we continue to electrify the grid and move toward green molecules on the gas side, we think we're in a unique position to be a leader in the clean energy transition. So as you think about how we approach Europeans for the sale of LNG, for example, this is right in our sweet spot. So this is not something that's unique to our LNG business. Every one of our facilities in California and there may be a couple of limited examples around our compressor stations. Today, source renewables to power those facilities. And - renewable green tariff from the local utility. In Mexico, we're helping the government move away from oil fired generation to natural gas generation in world kind of top three or four renewable developer there. So going back to your specific question, at Cameron, we think there is an opportunity for the expansion to be built on the basis of electric drives. We actually delayed the project somewhat to make sure that we can be more competitive. And yes, it does help us with the Europeans. But it's actually intrinsically in line with how we think about our own business. So certainly the Europeans like the fact that we're looking at certificating over a longer period of time. Our upstream emissions including where we get our source our natural gas. And from an operating standpoint, if we can power those facilities with the electricity that over time is increasingly decarbonize, we think that's a plus. So over a long period of time, I actually think the United States will be a competitive leader and being able to source and deliver LNG on a more cost competitive basis, but also on the basis of reduce emissions profile. So the second part of your question is the opportunity to sequester carbon, again aligned with my prior comments. But maybe Justin, you could talk about our approach on the sequestration side. Justin Bird : Yes. Thank you, Jeff. Yes, Alex if you think about Hackberry, we're very excited about that opportunity in part, because it will help reduce the emissions associated with the Cameron facility, equally, we think it's an exciting new business. And I think as EIA has said, we will not get to net-zero without substantial carbon sequestration. So in that light, in the third quarter of '21, we filed for a Class 6 carbon injection well permit with EPA. You talked about permitting reform, I do think it's early stage for EPA to consider these projects and we are doing all we can along with the industry to help support that process and to make this process expedient and to make sure all the right factors are considered. In May of this year, we signed our participation agreement with the Cameron LNG partners to jointly develop the opportunity. We're very excited about it. I think as Jeff referenced earlier a change in the Q45 benefits to that project. But again at a higher level, Alex, I think you asked about the Europeans, I think we as SI, and SI as part of Sempra are doing all that we can to make our projects less admitted and to promote the energy transition. As Jeff mentioned, whether that's through electric drives, whether through carbon sequestration, Jeff made a reference to sourcing gas, we're pursuing responsibly source gas. And also other design and operational changes that will make our projects better. Alex Kania : Great. Thank you. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Alex. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Britt Sunderland : Hi, good morning. It's Britt Sunderland on for Jeremy. Thanks for the time today. I wanted to follow up on the Circulation Reduction Act questions. California already has some leading environmental goals. But I'm curious if you see any potential changes in the state that could come from greater federal support via the legislation? Jeffrey Martin : Look, I think the good news is California has been a leader in the environmental space for three or four decades. And I think that one that the great things about the IRA bill is particularly it support for electric vehicles. So I think anything we're doing to help the United States continue to decarbonize is a positive. I think you'll find a lot of collaboration between California policymakers and a lot of the policy alignment that's embedded in that bill. But I would again step back and say, look it's in draft form today, a lot of different folks who have taken different views and perspectives on it. We think it has a number of positive attributes, but I think there will be some changes and revisions going forward. So we're going to continue to evaluate it in its current form. Britt Sunderland : I appreciate the commentary there. And then separately, this has been asked a couple of different ways, but I just wanted to circle back to the Bechtel work. Can you just provide background on when that started in terms of finalizing the EPC refresh on Port Arthur and just walk from the start of that process to the end of that process and when that should end? Jeffrey Martin : Look, we've been working with Bechtel for a number of years. From time to time, you'll get updated cost structure and processes from them. It's an open book process that we're working on with them right now. And all you're really talking about is a refresh or bring down to the cost based upon their earlier work, and that's something that is ongoing this fall. Britt Sunderland : Got it. Thank you very much for your time. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Martin : Good afternoon, Michael. Michael Lapides : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Thank you guys for taking my questions. I actually have a couple of, I apologize. The first one labor and wage inflation, we saw SoCalGas had recently make a Z Factor filing, we haven't actually seen one of those in a while in California. Talking about incremental cost in between rate cases to get alignment. Can you talk both for the California utility and the Texas utility and maybe how they are different, in terms of just what you're seeing in the O&M expense escalation? Jeffrey Martin : Well, what we try do is, we lay out our five-year plan, Michael, each fall we adjust that for expectation of costs and O&M and in capital. Today, what the good news is, as you think about other participants in the marketplace, they've had rate cases a year ago or two, three years ago. I have been following the Edison case. But what's most important for us is, we're actually filed all three of our rate cases in May of this year. And Allen outlined it earlier today, but Allen expects to get through his rate case proceeding this year with a good outcome we hope. And then SDG&E and SoCalGas, the most important part of this is SoCalGas just recently reached their labor agreement with their union. All of these current costs are going into the rate cases that were filed in May. And there will be a bring down to our cost structure here in California. And I think it's in October, November filing. So separate and apart from various mechanisms and account for this, I think one of the thing that really is a benefit to Sempra and is really a tailwind is to bring down on all of our cost, really in the next six to 12 months. The other thing which is related to your question, which I would mind touch on Michael, is the interest rate environment which obviously impacts all three of these businesses given how much their leverage to debt. But Trevor and his team have been actively managing our exposure to maturities and variable cost borrowings. So think about this as an example. Since 2017, we've been able to reduce our debt to cap from roughly 46% to 47% today, and we don't have any maturities between now and 2027. At our utilities, we have limited near term maturities, all of which are in the regulatory mechanisms in California and Texas. And at Sempra Infrastructure, you recall we've got a standalone balance sheet and done a lot of recent financings. They all are very limited near term maturities. So we even worked with KKR and ADIA and raised [$1 million] in the last 12 months from that business. So, as you think about our cost structure, it will be updated in our current pending rate cases. Things like interest rates which were following closely, we think we're in great shape on. Allen Nye : And Jeff, just as a cleanup, it was 56 to 47, yes, so 56... Michael Lapides : Understood. And this one maybe for Trevor. Just curious how you're thinking about that coming, look on core CapEx may go up, just given the new connects in the demand trends which have been phenomenal in that part of Texas or those parts of Texas. And you've already got the CapEx lined up as part of the California rate cases. It doesn't seem like LNG CapEx would ramp dramatically next year and probably be more in 2024 and beyond, then a lot of that would be self-funded down at the operating subsidiary. You're sitting with $2 billion of cash on the books, you have almost no short-term debt or very limited amount of short-term are currently maturing debt on the books. At what point do you actually think you're getting under-levered? Jeffrey Martin : Well, obviously we've got a record capital program of $36 billion, I think you can take from today's call, as we go through the processes this fall. I think if I was going to take over or under, when we come back on our February call next year. I would certainly take the over. We feel great about our balance sheet, but Trevor maybe as you think about where you expect to Oncor CapEx to go? How are you thinking about managing the balance sheet going forward? Trevor Mihalik : Yes. Sure, Jeff. And Michael, just with regards to the balance sheet, that's kind of just a flash in time, and so a lot of that those cash proceeds that we got from the sale of the 10% ADIA are sitting on the balance sheet there. And again, we have deployed that cash to paydown certain short-term debt since that period of time. But again, as Jeff said, we've got an opportunity to continue to deploy capital across the three businesses. But in particular we're seeing a lot of opportunity at Oncor and at the Cali utilities to continue to harden the systems and bring our growth to their various resources and their rate base areas. And so we feel good about deploying that capital into the CapEx plan. And as we continue to see CapEx most likely going up in the near term that will be a way to continue deploying that cash. Michael Lapides : Got it. And can you remind me, Trevor, does the Oncor generally dividend cash back up to the Sempra holding company or does Oncor retain that cash to finance its growth? Trevor Mihalik : No, Oncor will distribute certain amounts of cash back up under the LLC agreement that we have. And they do it both in dividends with excess cash, as well as tax payments back up to us, so that we can cover the tax, the cash tax payments on their earnings. Right now, they do have a lot of capital in front of them, and we continue to see us deploying cash into that business, but we are getting at a minimum cash tax payments on a quarterly basis back from Oncor. Michael Lapides : Oncor is largely self-funding from the Sempra Holding Company? Trevor Mihalik : Absolutely. Yes, Oncor is self-funding. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you guys. Much appreciated. Congrats on a really good quarter. Jeffrey Martin : Thanks, Michael. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Michael. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Hi, everybody. Jeffrey Martin : Hi, Ryan. Ryan Levine : In terms of the LNG cargo diversion for the quarter, can you comment on how impactful that was during the second quarter? And if you expect any benefits from that have to be a day of contractual opportunity that you have into the future quarters and beyond? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. Thank you for the question, Ryan, I'll pass it to a Citi alumnus and let Faisel respond to you. Faisel Khan : Yes, Ryan. So I think we've talked about the sort of the exposure, quite a bit over the last several years, it's really comes down to sort of our contract with Tangguh by 0.5 Bcf a day as you mentioned. And so for every dollar increase or decrease in the index price in our earnings sort of move up and down from that contract by just over $10 million in after-tax earnings. So that's kind of what you see. Whether the cargos come in or not really isn't important, it's just the contract itself is indexed to a price. Ryan Levine : Give a sense on what that was during this quarter? Faisel Khan : We give you - we disclosed on an annualized basis. So, I mean, if you want to, you can kind of split up that way, but that's kind of how the contract work is, there is seasonality to it. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then it was briefly mentioned the Hackberry's CCUS opportunity, the extent the inflation reduction were to pass, is that enough to reach FID there? Would there be any mitigating hurdles to cross to move that project forward? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. I appreciate the question, obviously, similar to some other projects we're continuing the process there from a permitting standpoint. We've recently made some progress with the participation agreement with the Cameron partners. Obviously, if that goes forward, it moves it from $50 a metric tonne to $85 a metric tonne, which certainly improves the economics. So it's a project that we're optimistic about in terms of building, Ryan. But just as importantly, it's thematic to how we think about making Cameron more competitive as an LNG exporter. Ryan Levine : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Jeffrey Martin : Thanks a lot, Ryan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Hi, good morning. Jeffrey Martin : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson : So, I wanted to touch basically you on the provision in the Senate for a netting fee. It sounds like you guys are pretty well positioned in terms of your own operations at least your opening comments, et cetera, about being ahead in California. A. Is that correct assessment? And then B. I'm just wondering is there any potential opportunity assuming that's correct to perhaps engage in activity with other parties, perhaps lowering their netting stuff, any comments on that? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, it's a very interesting questions, so thank you for raising that. I'll give you a couple of thoughts, which as you may have seen in our materials that since 2015, SoCalGas has really been on their horse, trying to reduce methane or fugitive emissions. They've got them down about 37%, well above the target that states that for 2025, and very close to the targets in some states for 2030. So this is going to be an issue of innovation, new technology, how you kind of improve your operational processes. And I think natural gas, Paul, has a long-term role in the economy here in the United States and globally. And I think they will not be an energy transition without energy security, is a base fuels like natural gas are imported. But if we don't get about the business about making sure that we don't have fugitive emissions, we're going to handicap the long-term viability of natural gas as being part of the energy mix. So there is no question that California has lead in this area. And the second part of your question is kind of interesting. I do think there'll be a very - there'll be a number of very large business built over the next decade and decade and a half around carbon trading. And companies that can assist others in reducing their carbon footprint, because remember at least today, the goal is net-zero by 2050. So the ability to basically lower your emissions, get credit for it, offset other emissions will be really important. And I think that's the business case that many people will be evaluating. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then San Diego, I think earlier this week passed a sort of let's say a carbon plan that dealt with the request of electrification and gas sort of an anti-fossil fuel sort of thing. Just wondering how you guys have a - what you guys think of it and what it may or may not mean to you guys? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. I'll give you a couple of thoughts. One is, I made this comment earlier, but we're an infrastructure company right. And the beautiful thing about that is in California, we'll go out and purchase a fuel at a certain price whether be electricity and natural gas. We will run a really highly efficient system and we pass that cost onto the customers without markup. So whether we're selling more natural gas or less natural gas, isn't really a financial issue to us. What we do believe in, is decarbonizing California. So we've made a goal to be a leader in electrification. But we also believe, Paul, over time we as state will be agnostic as to whether it's a green electron or a green molecule. So in San Diego, similar to L.A. and other parts of the States, there established a precedent where they'd rather focus on electrification and look at SDG&E, we're in both, right. So if you reduce capital investment in natural gas and you have to increase capital investment in new projects and electrification. Again this is not a financial impact to us. What we worry about in the process or where the people are inadvertently driving up the cost without the benefit that they might think from that. But look we're supportive of where the city wants to go and I think one thing that's unique about our business, whether we're in Louisiana or Mexico or California, we're strongly aligned with supporting policy makers and making sure we're advancing services for consumers. So, we don't tend to be obstructionists on these types of issues, we tend to try to find a way to help them meet their goals. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Have a good one. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Paul. Operator : We can now take our next question from Craig Shere of Tuohy. Please go ahead. Craig Shere : So, two LNG related questions. First, things you're focused more on mid-scale in Mexico, there is a variety of drivers for that. But we are hearing that nickel inflation is weighing more on the large-scale design versus mid-scale. And I was wondering if you have some thoughts about inflation, optimal design for the U.S., as we look past Cameron Phase 2 and Port Arthur Phase 1, and then I've just one more. Jeffrey Martin : Well, I appreciate the question, certainly, nickel is an important component in a variety of industrial processes including LNG facilities. The focus on mid-scale projects in Mexico appeals to us from a number of angles. One is, these are particularly, Vista Pacifico and Salina Cruz, our greenfield projects. And number two, we tend to try to avoid adding pipeline cost to a project. So in the Vista Pacifico case, we get a leverage of existing pipelines. In the ECA Phase 1 case, we had an existing pipeline, there are no new tanks for example at Cameron when you move to the larger scale projects, so we're not impacted by nickel. But that's one of the reason that your question is important is, it's not just nickel, there is inflationary pressures across the entire supply chain and that's why we're getting the work done with your EPC contractors to have your calls refresh and make sure you marry those up with your HOAs and SPAs to preserve your economics are so important. So you raise an important issue and it's one that we address an overall cost structure. Craig Shere : Right. And my last question and I preface this by saying, I'm not saying it's a probable scenario. But would you view it as crazy, I think we could have four LNG FIDs in 2023 totaling perhaps 25 to over 35 MTPA, combining Cameron's Phase 2, Port Arthur and some combination of a second and third Mexican liquefaction project. Jeffrey Martin : Craig, I certainly appreciate your optimism and I can tell you that the folks that spend time with particularly in the international oil and gas community. I think there is a growing recognition that the world today is short, natural gas. And I think not only is it short natural gas in key parts of the civilized world, OECD nations to non-OECD nations, where short infrastructure in key markets to export it. So we're going to be very disciplined about how we think about progress going forward. Justin, did a good job of articulating the various stakeholders, who are working with is. Right now, our primary focus is on making sure we deliver ECA Phase 1 on time and on budget. It takes up a lot of Justin's attention, that's our top priority. Secondly, we've taken the step and given some guidance around when we expect to take FID at Cameron. We think this is a world-class project, the type of partners we have there are absolutely excellent and partners that we've worked with for a long period of time. And as it come comes to Port Arthur and other opportunities, there is no question that there is tremendous excitement on the marketing side of it and it's our job to take additional time to make sure we line up the economics, manage the risk and do it in a way that creates a win for our utility shareholders. Craig Shere : Thank you. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you for joining us. Operator : We'll take our next question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Yes. Thanks so much for taking my question. Hopefully really easy one and I do wish your Padre's luck after the big signing earlier this week. So, if you're focused on an offtake agreement for the LNG. Just, I guess I just want to understand, is there significant competition from the LNG terminals? I'm kind of look at it from the offtake you're signing, like other than price, what else would a purchaser - purchase of the LNG use to pick Terminal A versus Terminal B or are other options? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, well, let me just start by saying that, a lot of times people tend to focus on company A versus company B versus Sempra. And the way I try to think about it is the United States has a big role to play and you're out there, competing as a nation against Australia and the Qataris, North Russia, Mozambique and other locations. As you get down in the United States, you start thinking about competitive advantages. One of the things, it's a lot of people are focused on is the relative advantages of having a West Coast facility that can shorten the transit time on the high seas from roughly 25 or 26 days to go from the Gulf Coast through the Panama Canal to Asia. Whereas a West Coast export facility can do that in 10 or 11 days. In the Gulf Coast, it really is well positioned, obviously to serve, Europe. And as you talk to those parties, a couple of things that creates an advantage for us. Number one, we're a $50 billion equity value company, we've got a strong balance sheet, we've been in the gas business for over 100 years. We have a lot of established relationships. So, if you're talking with a utility in Europe, those are important to them, that we've got that utility background that strong balance sheet. Also, we've got a track record, right. We've been in the LNG business for close to 17 years now. We're not a new entrant, so I think scale, strength of balance sheet, track record is important. And obviously having Cameron is one of the flagship projects in America today. It's a really, really important part of our reputation and we take the operational excellence at that facility, it's one of our top obligation. So if you look - this is not about us talking down the competition. We've got a pretty unique footprint, and that's been recognized today when we market our projects. It has created a lot of excitement around our opportunity to bring some of these to the market. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I just like you conclude by thanking everyone for joining us. I know it's a busy day with a lot of other competing company calls. If there are any follow-up items please reach out to our IR team with any additional questions. Also want to mention, Trevor and Glen, look forward to seeing many of you who are attending the Citi Conference later this month. I think that's on the 16th and 17th in Las Vegas. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Sempra's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under the Investors section.  Here in San Diego, we have several members of our management team with us today, including: Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, November 3, 2022, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. At Sempra, we're on a mission to build one of the largest and most resilient energy networks in North America. Today, think about our company's role in the energy markets, particularly against the backdrop of what the international energy agency is called, the world's first global energy crisis. Overseas, the supply-demand balance for oil and natural gas continues to be disrupted. War in Ukraine, supply chain challenges and reduced investments in traditional forms of energy resources as compared to prior periods are contributing to the global challenge. Without adequate security of supplies, coal is unfortunately playing a much larger role in the global energy mix today. In fact, the combustion of coal is expected to match a record high reach nearly a decade ago and will likely move higher and set a new record next year. Here in North America, energy markets are continuing to expand and become increasingly integrated. That is why investing in a modern energy network to support cleaner forms of energy and future economic growth is central to our efforts here at Sempra. We're also developing new large-scale export facilities so that European and Asian buyers of natural gas can diversify and improve the security of their energy supplies while backing coal out of their supply chain and the production of electricity. We're focused on expanding and modernizing North America's energy grids, Sempra's 3 growth platforms, Sempra California, Sempra Texas and Sempra Infrastructure are strategically positioned to help serve the growing needs of consumers in North America and around the world, while staying at the forefront of innovation and integrating cleaner forms of energy. Sempra's value proposition comes to life through its commitment to growing a stronger and more valuable business, one that serves the long-term interest of our customers and owners. Trevor will take us through each segment in detail, but first, I'd like to highlight some strategic focus at each of our growth platforms. At Sempra California, we're continuing to innovate and invest in new technologies that are aligned with the state's clean energy goals and focus on safety, innovation and grid resiliency. At Sempra Texas, Oncor is advanced in its base rate review which supports the continued expansion and modernization of its grid in Texas with a focus on load growth, grid reliability and the integration of renewables. We expect these developments will lead to substantially higher capital spending in future periods. And at Sempra Infrastructure, we're making significant progress aimed at providing cleaner and more secure energy to our customers. Specifically, we're excited to announce that we're expecting to take a final investment decision on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 in the first quarter of next year. Shifting to the results for the quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 and year-to-date 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $6.87. Based on the strength of these results, we are raising our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.70 to $9 per share. We're also affirming our existing full year 2023 EPS guidance range. Please turn to the next slide. In August, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. This is largely viewed as one of the most significant clean energy bills in U.S. history and incentivizes substantial investments in key areas that are expected to reduce carbon in society. This legislation also builds on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that passed last summer with a focus on modernizing infrastructure across the country. While some of the details in the IRA are still being finalized, we believe that our growth platforms are well positioned to benefit from the positive tailwinds created by this legislation. For example, a common component of these bills is the focus on electrification. And our California and Texas platforms are located in high-growth markets where the integration of renewables and the electrification of transportation continue to be major drivers of transmission and distribution infrastructure needs. Additionally, SoCal Gas continues to advance its position as a leader in the clean fuel space. The federal bills, I mentioned, outlined key spending priorities such as carbon capture, hydrogen and biogas. This is important as you consider the different innovative pilots SoCalGas has underway that are focused on the commercialization of new and cleaner fuels. Further, SoCalGas is integrating renewable natural gas, or RNG, across its pipeline system today. As a reminder, earlier this year, the CPUC issued a decision establishing a statewide RNG procurement standard, which, together with the federal bills, supports investment and continued decarbonization of SoCalGas' T&D system. And finally, at Sempra Infrastructure, we have identified opportunities for further innovation in carbon capture and sequestration such as the Hackberry project and other investments to further decarbonize our facilities and support our goal of delivering cleaner energy to our customers. In summary, we believe our platforms are well positioned to advance the critical priorities detailed in the legislation. Please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide several business updates for the quarter. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. Beginning with Sempra California. For SDG&E's 2022 cost of capital, a proposed decision and an alternative proposed decision were issued on September 30, and the CPUC is expected to vote out a decision today. We are pleased that both proposed decisions confirm that extraordinary circumstances were present and the cost of capital mechanism for 2022 should be suspended. If the proposed decision is approved, a second phase to determine SDG&E's rate of return for 2022 will be held. If the alternative proposed decision is approved, the 2022 cost of capital rates of return will be preserved and the proceeding will be closed. Next, I'd like to remind everyone that both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their cost of capital applications with the CPUC in the spring to update their respective authorized rates of return for 2023 through 2025. As part of this, both utilities updated their respective cost of debt requests as recently as September. We continue to expect a final decision on these filings by year-end. Also, both SDG&E and SoCalGas jointly filed a CPUC application with Southwest Gas to conduct hydrogen blending demonstration projects designed to further enhance grid resiliency and help California reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045. Each project builds upon years of research to identify ways to scale hydrogen blending to help drive decarbonization across multiple industries. These innovative projects are examples of our strong alignment with policymakers at both the state and federal level and are expected to provide incremental opportunities to invest in new sustainable forms of energy. Separately, SoCalGas recently made significant progress to substantially resolve the remaining legal and regulatory matters related to the 2015 Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility leak. In October, we announced that we settled with the fifth and final property developer and executed a settlement agreement with the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division and Public Advocates Office to resolve all aspects of the leak. The settlement with regulators is pending CPUC approval. Finalizing these settlements is a critical step in this matters resolution, and we recorded a $101 million after-tax charge in the third quarter. Please refer to our SEC filings for additional details and descriptions of the remaining open issues. Shifting to Sempra Texas. Oncor continues to experience tremendous growth. During the third quarter of 2022, Oncor added another 14, 000 new premises to its system and continues to anticipate maintaining approximately 2% average annual long-term premise growth, which is significantly above the national average. Also during the third quarter, Oncor added approximately 65 new transmission interconnection requests to its queue, which at this pace would set a company record for new annual interconnection requests. This highlights the continued growing demand and penetration of renewables in its service territory. Last month, Oncor management reviewed with its Board the need to grow and expand its transmission and distribution system with the expectation of substantially higher levels of capital spending. We expect to provide you with a more fulsome update on the 5-year capital plan in the first quarter. Additionally, Oncor expects a final order regarding its pending rate case by the end of the first quarter of 2023 with new rates going into effect thereafter. At Sempra Infrastructure, we've made substantial progress moving Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 closer to FID, and Justin will speak to those details in just a moment. At both Sempra and Sempra Infrastructure, we've stated the importance of advancing projects with a robust risk-adjusted return as well as maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. To that end, we've been working diligently on an optimal financing and capital structure plan for Port Arthur to align with those principles that would allow us to enhance our risk-adjusted returns all while maintaining or exceeding our credit metrics. We're currently advancing 2 efforts to raise capital to fund the construction of the first phase of Port Arthur LNG all with a view towards securing lower cost of capital for the project. The first work stream targets issuing debt at the project level, and we expect to kick this off in the coming weeks. In addition, we've already launched the second work stream, which aims to raise capital by selling project-level equity to one or more investors. These work streams are expected to : pull forward a portion of the project's NPV to reduce our capital contribution, maintain Sempra and Sempra Infrastructure's strong credit profile while also highlighting notable value to our owners. Next, I'll turn the call over to Justin to discuss additional updates at Sempra Infrastructure. Justin Bird : Thanks, Trevor. Let me start at Cameron LNG, where operations for Phase 1 are going very well, with production levels exceeding expectations. In addition, both the proposed Phase 2 expansion project and related debottlenecking activities of the existing 3 trains are moving along as planned. At Train 4, FEMSA the U.S. pipeline regulator recently voiced support for our pending FERC permit. We continue to work through the competitive feed process, which we anticipate will be completed in the summer of 2023 and expect to take FID shortly thereafter. Also, we expect the full debottlenecking efforts to be complete before commercial operations commence at Train 4. Next, I want to provide you an update on progress at our ECA LNG Phase 1 project, where we recently began erecting the first structural steel on site. Overall, construction is slightly behind our original plan, but the project is on budget, and we continue to expect to commence commercial operations in the middle of 2025. At our Energy Networks business, we're pleased to announce that our Puebla fuels terminal outside of Mexico City has started commercial operations. This terminal is integrated with our Veracruz Port and ViadeMexico terminals and combined creates our refined fuels terminal network that we collectively refer to as Golfo Centro. This network provides for the end-to-end transportation of fuel by ship to the port of Veracruz and then into the Mexico City market by both rail and truck. The facilities are supported by a 20-year contract with Valero for the entire offtake. Finally, at our Clean Power business, we signed a 20-year power purchase agreement for Cimarron, a 300-megawatt wind development project with Silicon Valley Power, a AA-rated entity to deliver electricity into the California power market. The site is adjacent to our Inner ores Phase 1 and 2 wind facilities and directly ties into our power transmission lines at the California, Mexico border. We plan to proceed to FID pending receipt of final permits and completion of the engineering and design work. With that, let's move on to the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 update. Please turn to the next slide. As Trevor mentioned, we've had an exciting quarter. Port Arthur LNG continues to draw strong market demand and as advanced permitting and development status makes it an increasingly attractive project. As I have mentioned, there are 3 key work streams associated with reaching FID, and we are optimistic that we can achieve each of these by the first quarter of next year. First, we completed the EPC refresh and signed a $10.5 billion contract that is dependent on reaching FID. This fixed price turnkey contract creates critical momentum for the project. Efforts to date for the project include preparing the site for an efficient construction process, moving a major state highway, building dock capacity for the construction materials and conducting robust soil test across the entire site. Second, as Trevor detailed above, the financing work streams are underway. Finally, on the marketing front, things continue to progress at a rapid pace and we are in advanced discussions with several potential customers for long-term offtake contracts and are confident in our ability to convert existing HOAs into SBAs. Based on these discussions, we have more than enough interest to be in a position to take FID in the first quarter of 2023. Please turn to the next slide. The interest in Port Arthur LNG exceeds the volume of Phase 1, and we are actively marketing an expansion that could include a combination of Trains 3 and/or 4. The takeaway here is that there are scenarios in which we are oversubscribed for the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 development project and look forward to advancing ongoing offtake discussions for a potential expansion phase. We will provide a further update on Port Arthur on our fourth quarter earnings call. Please turn to the next slide where Trevor will review Sempra's financial results for the quarter. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $485 million or $1.53 per share. This compares to third quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $648 million or $2.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, third quarter 2022 earnings were $622 million or $1.97 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $545 million or $1.70 per share. On a year-to-date basis, 2022 GAAP earnings were $1.656 billion or $5.23 per share. This compares to year-to-date 2021 GAAP earnings of $650 million or $2.09 per share. Adjusted year-to-date 2022 earnings were $2.172 billion or $6.87 per share, which compares to our year-to-date 2021 adjusted earnings of $1.949 billion or $6.27 per share. As a reminder, this is the first quarter where we will reflect the full impact of the minority interest sales in Sempra Infrastructure Partners, which closed with KKR in October of 2021, and ADIA in June of 2022. In addition to improving our year-over-year results, we raised over $5 billion of capital through our minority interest sales a portion of which was used to lower parent debt and reduce our interest rate exposure outside of our utilities. Taken together, our strong financial results and growing adjusted earnings demonstrate the strength of our underlying business. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following : $79 million of higher earnings at Sempra California from income tax benefits from flow-through items and CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas; $50 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to higher consumption and customer growth and rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital; $74 million of lower earnings at Sempra Infrastructure attributable to higher noncontrolling interest, net of operating earnings; and $22 million of lower losses at parent and other. Please turn to the next slide. We are pleased with our performance this quarter, which has generated a lot of momentum across our platforms for the remainder of the year. We look forward to progressing the cost of capital and general rate case proceedings at Sempra California and the resolution of the base rate case at Oncor while continuing development progress at Sempra Infrastructure. We view these work streams as opportunities to continue to drive significant growth in shareholder value into 2023 and beyond. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. And I will now stop and we can open the line up to take some of your questions. Operator : This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now open the line to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : So Jeff, good news on Port Arthur 1 for sure. Just on Port Arthur -- as your slide noted, you guys have some offtake already locked in and media, I think, is reported on more agreements with Williams. Are those sort of in advanced stages as well? And in terms of FID formation, just given Bechtel has been on site for Port Arthur. Is there an advanced understanding of the EPC process and available EPC capacity to do the work on Phase 2 in sequential order? Jeff Martin : Yes. Look, it's a great set of questions you have there. I would refer, again, the audience to Slide 8 of our presentations, and it kind of reflects what you're just describing, which is as you look forward to Phase 2, which is the opportunity to deliver both Train 3 and Train 4. It reflects the fact that we've got volumes currently committed at Cameron that could be moved over to support Phase 2, and it also reflects roughly 3 million tonnes per annum of capacity that's in advanced negotiations currently. But this goes back short of something we've talked about a lot in the past, which is we really think there's a strategic advantage at Port Arthur. So remember, we've got 3,000 acres of frontage on the waterway there, roughly 3 miles of access to water. Also, what's very attractive to customers is the potential scale of the development opportunity. You'll recall that this has the opportunity to be up to 8 trains. And if you ever got that far, and obviously, that's well into the future, it would be the largest export project in the Western Hemisphere. So it really has the ability to scale quite nicely. And to your point, Bechtel probably has the best reputation for delivering projects on time and on budget. They got great craft in the Gulf Coast region. They have spent a significant amount of time on this site, and that's been a real big linchpin and get us confident in our FID opportunity for Phase I, which we'll talk about, hopefully, in Q1, but it also is a real competitive advantage for Phase 2. So when you think about the considerations I just outlined, there's no question that we're receiving a lot of strong inbound interest on Phase 2. And I'll tell you something else as we make progress, Shar, toward getting to an SI decision on Phase I and it actually increases the interest and likelihood that Phase 2 will go forward. So we said this in our prepared remarks, but the time we get to our February call, we're hopeful to provide a lot more detail on our progress on Phase 2. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. And Jeff, the tactile has the EPC capacity to continue on Phase 2? Jeff Martin : Look, I will tell you that they're one of our finalists on the Cameron expansion project. Obviously, they've got opportunities to work on a variety of projects around the world. But from our perspective, we're really pleased to have been part of Phase 1, and there's no question that the most ideal situation for our company is to not allow your EPC contractor to demobilize the ability to go from project to the next could be a real competitive advantage for Port Arthur. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Great. And then, Jeff, just moving on to the guidance assumptions. I guess, what are some of the inputs that you're thinking about as you're reaffirming '23, especially as we're thinking about bridging from '22. There's clearly a strong base in '22 but could we get your thoughts on some of the contingency that is building for '23? And maybe how you're seeing some of the offsets like O&M and interest rates get incorporated into the '23 assumptions? Jeff Martin : Yes. Let me give you my perspective on this, and I would tell you this goes back to something that we as a management team have discussed, which is we're really, really happy with the progress we're making across all 3 of our growth platforms. I think the true competitive advantage for any company always comes down to the depth of your talent and leadership and how crisp your strategy is. And I think you're seeing both of those factors show up in our results. Let me give you a little bit of perspective before I turn to 2023. When you think back to where we were in 2021, we launched 2021 with an estimated guidance range of $7.50 to $8.10. And Shar, you may recall, that we actually delivered $8.43 last year, and we did not change our 2022 guidance. We kept our 2022 guidance at $8.10 to $8.70. And now we're in a great situation where we're updating that guidance to $8.70 to $9 or a midpoint of roughly $8.85. So now as you look forward into 2023, our guidance, which we published in February is unchanged at $8.60 to $8 -- to $9.20 or roughly a midpoint of $8.90. So very similar circumstance that we're walking into next year in terms of how we found ourselves earlier this year. But I think the key for us is we are very excited about the strength of all 3 growth platforms. Certainly, the progress we're making on Port Arthur Phase 1 and particularly Cameron expansion causes us to have a pretty bullish view of the future. And in our prepared remarks, we reaffirmed our guidance for next year. And once it's full visibility to our 2022 financial results, we'll be excited to take this up again on our February call. Operator : And our next question will come from Ross Fowler with UBS. Ross Fowler : So maybe following up on Shar's question a little bit here. There's certainly some headwinds I can think about into '23 from '22. One, you've had good weather in Texas this year. there's some excess marketing revenue on Cameron from some excess volumes in the second quarter. And then obviously, there will be a full year at the minority stake. So are those some of the drivers that are sort of as you contextualize '23 against your 6 to 8 sort of long-term growth guidance that you've given previously that you're thinking about? And then as you think about '23, once you get to '22, I think you said in your answer, Jeff, you're going to work into that '23 number and you provide a little bit of an update on in February in the call. Jeff Martin : Yes. What might be helpful, Ross, let me just comment potentially in terms of how I think about the long-term growth opportunity at Sempra. And I'm going to pass it to Trevor. And maybe, Trevor, you can walk through some of the drivers for the quarter because I think that informs our continued bullish view for next year. But I was thinking about this, Ross, earlier this year, we began to execute on our $36 billion 5-year capital program. And I think as you've seen us update across the year, we've been making great progress. We're still very comfortable with our 6% to 8% long-term EPS growth rate. And I think as you've heard us describe a new set of opportunities that are in front of us, I think we're going to be working really hard to see if we can't beat those numbers in the future. And I look back at our growth rate on an earnings per share basis. Now it's a new midpoint of $8.85. And since the end of the year in 2017, that would allow us to grow our earnings per share at an 11% CAGR. And so I think we've got the right mix. We've got the right strategy. We have really sharp execution occurring across the business. And that's shown up in the quarter. And maybe, Trevor, you could talk about some of the puts and takes in the quarter and how that makes you think about 2023. Trevor Mihalik : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, Ross, as Jeff said, there were some puts or takes in the quarter. But underlying that, I think we really did have a strong operational performance across all 3 platforms. And so what I want to do is just maybe give you a little more color and clarity around what we presented on Page 10. First, at the Cal Utilities, there was a $36 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, and that was roughly split evenly between the utilities. And then in Sempra Texas, Oncor had significantly higher consumption, as you mentioned, this quarter as well as rate updates from the increase in capital deployed year-over-year, and that really was about $58 million of higher earnings. And then third, and this is a big point that we kind of brought out in the prepared remarks is at SI, the big driver here relates to the minority interest sale. And this really reduced the period-over-period earnings of about $83 million but these were partially offset by higher earnings in the business driven by higher gas prices and the outperformance in the power business as well as assets placed into service. So what I'm really pleased about is that we had a 9.5% year-over-year growth for adjusted EPS over the 9 months ended September 30. And as Jeff said, all in all, this really speaks to the strength and diversity of the T&D platform. And so we're pretty pleased about where we are in raising our guidance. Ross Fowler : That's great, Dave. And then just one more for me. You talked about sort of running through the -- or starting the capital raise project and the financing work streams for Port Arthur. The AA, I think, can you remind us that contemplated a 30% equity stake from ConocoPhillips. Did it not? Jeff Martin : It sure did. Ross Fowler : Okay. And then one last one, maybe just an update on the Angeles Link project. That's a pretty big and exciting potential growth area for you with hydrogen. What steps from here are in the near term as we try to continue to move that to realization? Jeff Martin : Yes. Thanks for asking about that, Ross. I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll pass the mic to Kevin to fill us in on some of the details. But it's really interesting, as we think about California and SoCalGas in particular, one of the things we talk a lot about internally as a management team is important to win in the business of today. And quite clearly, our customers are asking us to decarbonize the system and make sure it's safe. And that's one of the reasons we talked about this in our prepared remarks, we've set a self-imposed goal of delivering 20% renewable natural gas to our core customers by 2030. We're very pleased to see the state step forward and mandate to all load serving entities should be delivering at least 12% of that period of time. So we're going to make sure the system is safe today. We're going to continue to decarbonize it, but there's no question that hydrogen is the future, particularly for hard to decarbonize areas around heavy-duty trucking, some industrial applications and hopefully for power generation. The United States is behind in the hydrogen race. Europe is making great progress. Many of our customers on the LNG side, particularly in Japan are much further ahead. And there's a clarity and call across the policymakers in California that they want to see companies step up in innovation and new applications around hydrogen. That's one of the reasons we're really excited about the leadership that SoCalGas has shown. And Kevin -- maybe you could provide a little bit of visibility on to next steps on Angeles Link? Kevin Sagara : Yes. Thanks for that. I'll just kind of echo off a little bit here, but Southern California is one of the nation's largest manufacturing areas and has a very significant industrial base, along with the nation's largest ports. So opportunities to back off diesel and other fossil fuels and even natural gas to help accelerate California's and the region's clean air goals is really important. And we've gotten a lot of good early feedback from stakeholders around this project, including city and state officials, labor and environmental groups. All of it's been really positive, even the governor, Governor News and Energy Secretary Grand Home has had some positive statements so far, so good on that project. And I guess in terms of next steps, we filed for a memo account at the CPUC to start capturing costs related to developing a large project like this, I think the minimal account asked for something just short of $30 million, and we expect that minimal account would get approved before year-end. So it's early, but we're really bullish on this. Operator : Our next question will come from Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse. Nicholas Campanella : Just couple of questions on just the financing comments on Port Arthur. Can you just maybe expand on where you have flexibility in those 2 efforts to raise capital? I recall you have some amortizing debt at Cameron 1, 2, 3. So is there additional kind of debt capacity at the SIP level already? And then just with the ownership structure around Port Arthur, like is there a kind of like a targeted pro forma ownership we should be thinking about for Phase 1? And is the goal ultimately here to limit external common equity at the Sempra level? Jeff Martin : Yes, there's no question, it will be a goal to limit any external equity at the Sempra level, and you raised some great points. So let me kind of cap off. There's 2 work streams underway here. One is the equity process that's referenced in our slides. And after I've covered that, I'll pass it to Faisel to talk about the debt amortization and his approach to the financing, which they're looking to launch near term. As we've disclosed in the past, Nick, we've been taking a tremendous amount of inbound interest regarding participation in the capital structure at Port Arthur over the last 12 to 18 months. So we see this as an opportunity to really kick off a sales process to sell a noncontrolling stake that could result in Sempra Infrastructure's ownership settling to a level similar to ConocoPhillips, whether a little bit more or less. The key for us is we're really focused on 3 goals on the equity side. Number one, making sure that we highlight value for our owners. If we use this as an opportunity to pull forward the projects NPV to reduce our capital contribution. One of the things we talk about a lot inside the company is really replicating what we did at Cameron, which effectively allows us to take a carried interest and also make sure that as part of this process, it allows us to maintain Sempra and Sempra Infrastructure strong credit profile. So in general, this is a way for us to effectively take a carried interest in the project, create a really strong return on invested capital and deliver a great outcome for our shareholders. And I would say, just as importantly, and you'll hear us talk about this a lot more. What's most important about Phase I is also making sure it sets us up well for Phase 2 and 3. So this is the type of project given its scale, getting Phase 1 done really makes future phases a lot more exciting and a lot more probable. But maybe Faisal can stop there and maybe you can turn to the debt side and what the plans are for the financing. Faisel Khan : Yes. Sure. So first of all, I think you're right, we do have amortizing debt across all of number infrastructure. It's not just at Cameron, but it's also within some of our joint ventures in the pipeline side. And so that does give us sort of more debt capacity at the Sempra Infrastructure level. And actually, our credit metrics have improved from where we were earlier in the year to where we are right now. So we are building sort of debt capacity as we sort of get closer to FID. So as we think about sort of the layers of financing for Port Arthur, we've been very consistent about this over the last few -- over the last several quarters. First, we're going to start with sort of nonrecourse project financing underpinned by creditworthy counterparty. So it's nonrecourse, it's investment-grade pricing. We've got strong interest from the banks to finance this project. Secondly, as we've done in the past, it's project-level equity for off-takers. So you've seen Conoco fill up a world-class partners step into this project with us in the HOA side, so that's for 30% equity interest. And then as Jeff alluded to, we've got the potential to sell down additional equity to project level and highlight value. So that's kind of where we're at. We feel like we're in a good spot, and we've been working on this for a very long period of time. Nicholas Campanella : Really helpful. And just shifting to Texas and Oncor, just line of sight to getting this case done here. I know we're kind of coming towards the end of the the process, but is the settlement still in the cards, if at all? And are you willing to just kind of take the full distance on the final order at this point? Jeff Martin : Sure. I would just start by saying we're pleased to have the Oncor team in the room with us today. So we've got Allen with us, and I'll let Allen jump in here in a second. But Trevor and I just got back from a Board meeting in the last couple of weeks in Dallas actually we're in Fort Worth. We continue to be really impressed with the team, the quality of the relationships there. There's obviously a stunning amount of growth taking place across the states. So I think the rate case is really important. And I really think that we're going to get a great outcome independent of whether it's a settlement or commission decision. But Allen, perhaps we could just talk about procedurally where we're at in the rate case and how you think about next steps. Allen Nye : Yes, you bet. Thanks, Jeff. Just generally, where we are, as you said, we did have our hearing on the merits September 26 through October 4. Since then, we hold the parties have filed 2 rounds of post-hearing breeze, and we're anticipating a proposal for decision at the end of December. With the commission likely to take up a proposed our final order rather and a couple of open meetings, at least first quarter of next year, but final order before the end of the first quarter. Just a little color on the hearing. We believe it went very well. Our witnesses performed very well. Many of them were not even cross examined. From a settlement perspective, we have had extensive discussions. We will continue to have discussions. Thus far, they have not reached something that we believe is beneficial to the company, the stakeholders, especially the rate payers. So while those conversations will continue, we are very confident in our case. We think we put on a very strong case. And should we need to go to the commission, we're comfortable and confident in doing so. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : One probably a follow-up for Allen, which is starting to see housing prices dip a bit Texas. It's happening in a lot of places, but some of the dips in not only outside your -- in and around the edges of your service territory, but also kind of south of you are starting to get pretty meaningful. Just curious how that impacts, if anything at all or how a slowdown in residential construction impacts kind of your views of what kind of resi load growth would be and what the need for new infrastructure? I know you're talking a lot about potentially raising your capital spend budget. My guess is a lot of that has to do with a lot of the new renewable and storage that's coming online. But can you kind of talk high level about those items? Jeff Martin : And Michael, I'll just jump in real quickly to say that I think we're really seeing great growth on the residential customer and industrial side in -- Allen, what might be particularly helpful to be responsible to Michael is some of the news you've got in terms of reaching the highest permitted housing starts and what some of the issues are in terms of letting that show up on the system. Allen Nye : Sure. Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, Michael, I agree. We're seeing -- I think it was in some of the remarks earlier, we added 14, 000 new premises this quarter. And while we're a little below probably in the 1.7 range, whereas we've been 2% over the last few years, we're still anticipating and seeing long-term projections still in the 2% range. To Jeff's point, I may have mentioned this before, yes. We saw in June our largest request for new subdivisions ever in our company's history. So while there's a little dip in premise growth so far this year, -- and I'll tell you a little color on that is what we're hearing is that is primarily supply chain and labor issues associated with the builders in our areas. But the demand for lots, the demand for new subdivisions we're still seeing long term around 2%. And just overall on our system, I know you didn't ask about it, but -- it's been discussed a little bit previously. Yes. To your point, transmission points of interconnection, especially on the renewable side are extremely high. I think Jeff said earlier, we're entering historic year, and that's accurate. We're at 565 active request right now versus $370 million the same time last year, and West Texas just continues to grow at record pace. We're seeing 29% annual load growth on the Culberson Lube a new peak of 1,000 megawatts versus 900 megawatts last year. New peaks in the Far West Texas, Weather zone at $54.86 versus $51.63 last year. Stanton loop growing at 16% annual load growth. And similar back to your residential, just another day to point for you there. It's not just the DFW area. We're seeing, for example, Waco, load growth in Waco at 3x the ERCOT average. So we're continuing to see really strong growth across our system regardless of a little dip this year in premise growth, which we think is related to issues on the builder side, and we think it will bounce back, and we're continuing to see projected long-term growth of 2% on the printer side on our system. Jeff Martin : And Michael, I'll make one other comment maybe to wrap it up with Allen, which is Trevor and I will be back at the Oncor Board early next year. to review their final capital program. You may recall that about this time last year, we had approved their prompt our capital program and reviewed their 5-year plan. And it wasn't until like February or March up lead Allen that we already updated by about $200 million. So this will give us a chance to pick up on some of these new opportunities. And the confidence level, at least from Sempra's perspective, and I think Allen's we're going to have the opportunity to put a lot more capital to work in the future than it is in the current plan. So stay tuned, and we look forward to updating everybody on next year's call about that. Michael Lapides : Got it. I had one follow-up, and it's probably a Justin, one. Costa Azul, I think you made the comment that Costa Azul may be a little bit behind schedule, but the cost hasn't really moved, and it's a matter of months, it's not years, the fund. If I remember correctly, you all have contracts already on one of the big pipelines that goes out of the Permian West towards the California border and then it would connect and head south to Costa Azul. Spreads between Waha, West Texas and California are really wide? I mean Waha gas went negative recently. Does that imply that in the short run, long term, that gas is going to be used to supply Costa Azul small scale. But short run, are you guys benefiting from that? And has that gotten more material and potentially a tailwind? I know you've talked a lot about some of the headwinds for next year. Justin Bird : Yes, Michael. I think as we move forward toward FID on ECA Phase 1, one of the things our Board of Directors, and we wanted to make sure that we thought we had adequate transportation capacity through the areas you described. And until we actually utilize that capacity for ECA, it really gives us a chance to optimize and you've been seeing us do that. So yes. It's a tailwind. Michael Lapides : Got it. The fact that Waha is pricing well below its total gas porter is above Henry Hub. Until Cost small scale comes online, you're actually capturing that spread? Justin Bird : Correct. Operator : Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : So I just wanted to refresh here back to where we started the conversation on Port Arthur, PA1 and more importantly, PH2 here. Just can you give us a little bit more of a sense -- you alluded to it in the prepared remarks, has the ability to pivot readily into PA2 here. And can you speak more directly to the permitting context here, how that might impact the EPC time line and also the ability to readily translate that HOA interest? Jeff Martin : Well, let me do this. Let me speak real briefly to Phase 2 and recap some of our prior comments. And maybe, Justin, I think there might be value to go from the Bechtel contract plus some of the things you're working on to make Q1 FID happen. But I would just go back -- just take you back, Julian, if you allow me to this macro view, you've got a big scalable project, right, which is unique relative to a lot of our competitors. It's well situated on the ship channel there with over 3,000 acres. And we've had Bechtel site for a very, very long period of time. So that enabling EPC contract that helps us launch Phase I is critical as we continue to build out and refine our price estimates for Phase 2. So in our prepared slides on Slide 8, you can see we've got pretty advanced interest at least for Train 3 thus far, and we've got conversations well beyond that. So our goal really is, is we make and crystallize the opportunity for Phase 1, there's no question that the market interest in Phase 2 will be increased, and we're hopeful to be back in front of our investors on our end of year call, Q4 call in February with a more detailed view about the Phase II opportunity. But there may be some benefit, Justin, just to walk through in a little bit more granular level what we're trying to accomplish over the next 90 days. Justin Bird : Yes. Thank you, John. Yes. Julien, I think as we look at Port Arthur Phase 1, I think the completion of the EPC contract is really the linchpin that's really going to unlock us to have the ability to convert those -- into definitive SPAs and really to capture the remaining interest in that project and frankly, additional trains at that project. So that work stream is ongoing, very dynamic, moving quickly. On the finance side, I think Jeff and Trevor and Faisel all cover that. And then finally, we're working through the required governance process with our Board of Directors and management to really get to a point where we can take final investment decision in the first quarter of next year. As Jeff mentioned, as you move toward that date, the ability to commercially contract on Phase 2 and subsequent phases increases. As you know, the market tends to coalesce around projects that have a high probability of launching. And I think the market is starting to see that momentum at Port Arthur. Jeff Martin : I just mentioned 1 other contextual comment for you, Julien, that you might find interest in. As you may recall, over the last 12 months, you've seen various parties announced an SPA. And you've seen us take a lot of questions about HOAs. But what this really reflects is the key linchpin is getting that EPC contract done and not committing to the pricing of the offtake until you have that in hand. And now Justin's team is running quickly to go back and document those definitive SPAs on the basis of those economics, which is really positive. And finally, on our Q2 call, we got pressed a lot about the future opportunity for Port Arthur and I actually said there are scenarios where it could occur after the FID for Cameron, and there were some scenarios where it could occur in the first half. So it's a real credit to Justin's team and really a validation of the level of interest in Port Arthur that we've been able to accelerate it to a projected FID decision in Q1. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Right. Got it. But from a permitting perspective, any specific updated time line there just on PAT. Just when could we get to that FID for the second round here just to reconcile that. Justin Bird : Yes. So as you look at Port Arthur Phase 1, I think, again, 3 work streams that you should watch. One is commercial interest, and we've talked a lot about that today. The second would be really the construction contract. And again, as Jeff mentioned earlier, the important thing there is the quality of Bechtel and really the ability to not force a demobilization and remobilization puts us at a competitive advantage. And then finally, here, we're waiting for our FERC order, where we have applied that has been before FERC and we're continuing to move that forward. So we do need a FERC order for subsequent phases at Port Arthur. But again, we think that process has been commenced a long time ago, and we're optimistic. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. Okay. So it's a little bit unclear on timing. But just pulling it all together, Jeff, if I can -- when can you be in a position to provide sort of this longer-term view with an EPS CAGR that includes presumably these PA1, right? I know you talked about the CAGR a moment ago with Ross, but can you speak to this about when we get that fully inclusive one? Jeff Martin : Yes. We have a convention, as you know, of doing a roll forward of our 5-year plan. That process is underway by Peter Wall and Trevor currently. I think we'll be in a position on our February call to do a couple of things. We'll go back and relook at our 2023 guidance. We will expect to announce our 2024 guidance. And we hope at that time, have a definitive view on the roll forward of our capital program. Sometimes in the past, Joe, you may recall, we've saved that for an analyst conference later in the spring. We have not made a definitive decision with the IR team. It's whether it will be an analyst conference and my personal orientation is to come back on that February call and make sure it's fulsome and be in a position to talk about the roll forward of our 5-year capital program, which, to your point, should reflect the opportunities that we're discussing this morning. Operator : And our next question will come from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Wondering if you might people to talk to just the hydrogen opportunities a bit more, the recent MOU with AVANGRID and then thoughts on the blue hydrogen potential opportunity down in the Gulf Coast. Just when might we see in terms of timing, some potential concrete project opportunities arise? Jeff Martin : Yes, sure. We're very bullish on hydrogen. I made some comments about this earlier. One of the benefits we've had is really twofold. One is S&P came out with a study or an article in the last 6 months, had talked about the 25 leading pilot programs for hydrogen in the United States. And over half of them, David, are in the Sempra family of companies. So we've made this a strategic priority. I've made this comment before. We need to win in the business of today. while we're building a competitive position in the business of the future. And there's no question that across our 3 growth platforms, hydrogen will play a larger role. So most of what's taken place in California today is folks are evaluating opportunities to either blend hydrogen into the existing pipeline system. There's been some work done at SoCalGas about creating hydrogen fuel homes on the residential side. Fuel cells are a big opportunity for our core customers. But I think, broadly speaking, this is a strategic commitment. I think 1 thing that I would follow is one of the things that Kevin talked about earlier, this memo account process that we expect to have resolved by the end of the year. That will be a very, very strong signal from the policymakers in the State of California about their commitment to make sure that we fully optimize the hydrogen future. But maybe, Justin, since we have an LNG and Net Zero P&L in Justin's portfolio, you could talk about how we're having conversations with some of our LNG buyers. And I've said this very recently in a speech that the United States has a unique opportunity to not only improve the energy security of many of our allies, I think we're in a position to produce the cleanest value chain from the wellhead to the liquefaction facility of any country in the world. I think innovation is going to be a key part of that. But Justin, maybe you could talk about some of the projects you all have underway to help introduce hydrogen. Justin Bird : Yes. David, great question. Look, we at Sempra Infrastructure are very excited. As Jeff referenced earlier, we talked about succeeding in the business of today and really looking forward to being able to be successful in the future. In the middle of last month, you noted we signed our agreement with AVANGRID. And that really is about working together to identify, appraise and potentially develop large-scale green hydrogen projects to meet the needs of energy and decarbonization in both the U.S. and abroad. The LNG business, as Jeff mentioned, provides a strong foundation for our ability to work with all of those partners as they look to decarbonize and look toward future energy, whether it's green hydrogen, blue hydrogen or blue ammonia.  So we're excited about the opportunities in front of us. I think the other thing you saw recently, the inflation Reduction Act really provides a springboard for not only the hydrogen business, but also for carbon sequestration. We're excited to continue developing Hackberry with our partners. We think it's a wonderful opportunity to really decarbonize our LNG facilities and really look at as a means to capture carbon in local industrial facilities as well. So we're very excited about the opportunities in the Net Zero side of our business. Operator : Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Maybe just given your sort of historical time line presence and considering shortages, supply chain issues, et cetera, et cetera. How should we think about assuming a Phase 1 FID green light here in the first quarter? How should we think about -- can you give us a time line on the COD of that project? Jeff Martin : Well, first off, that will certainly be tied to the date and time and when we take FID. These projects typically get built between 50 and 60 months. But if you look at Q1 and assume that there's an FID in that time frame, I'd look out in that 50 to 55 month time frame and you can back into a reasonable estimate. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Perfect. And just one quick follow-up. As we think about financing the project, are we going to -- basically, your question is, are we going to be -- are you going to be fully financed the $10. 5 billion by first quarter next year? Or is that expected in chunks? Jeff Martin : Yes. Justin did a great job of kind of outlining some of the key milestones we're tracking to get to FID. But our assumption and goal, Durgesh, would be that when we get to an FID decision with our Board, we go through a very fulsome process of evaluating all aspects of the transaction. And we will not take FID without having lined up both the financing and the equity. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Jeff, sorry, to make the call, go the full distance here. But just one strategic question. So obviously, you're having a lot of success with growth projects in all your businesses. And we're now seeing, I think, a lot better public market values of midstream company and particularly companies that are successfully growing LNG. So Justin, when you're looking at that big picture decision on the structure of the company and the like, just maybe it would be helpful to get some thoughts on how you're kind of thinking about that in terms of does it make sense to keep all this together or to review other options? Jeff Martin : Yes. Sure. No problem. I'll tell you, it's a great question. And one 1 the things that we spend the most time on our Board of Directors is strategy. So when you think back to 2017 timeframe, Steve, assuming we hit the midpoint of the new guidance range we put out today, we have been successful in growing the EPS of this business at an 11% CAGR. So I think we've got a really high-quality leadership team, and I don't mean just the folks in this room, but across our top 25 or 40 leadership group. We've got a really good, high-performing culture. And I think we've got a razor-sharp strategy. One of the things that you're really seeing come together in the first 3 quarters of this year is our ability to produce improved financial results. in all 3 of our growth platforms, and we try to integrate those activities from the Sempra level, I would say, are doing extremely well. And you're absolutely right. We've got growth in California. We've got growth in Texas. We continue to have a lot of growth opportunities in Mexico. And certainly, Justin's business really has a unique opportunity set. So I would say we're currently happy with the overall organization of our 3 platforms and particularly Sempra Infrastructure. Remember, too, Steve, that Sempra Infrastructure has been very critical in providing additional cash flows to support growth in our utilities. And I think going forward, part of what we need to do to be successful is to continue sourcing the lowest cost of capital to help SI grow. You've seen us be fairly creative through the KKR process and ADI and now the process that Faisal described earlier today. So we've demonstrated a willingness to transact at the Sempra Infrastructure level and at the project level, and we'll continue to forecast -- and we continue to forecast a portfolio of new opportunities to grow that business. So I think the most important takeaway relative to your question is our sole focus is on driving value to Sempra shareholders. And I think you've seen this, but we're willing to look at new and better ways to do that. And that -- and part of that is continuing to optimize all 3 growth platforms. So there's a fair amount of excitement inside of our company about the increased earning power of all 3 platforms. And we're looking forward to executing into 2023. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Just hopefully quickly, 2 quick questions. One on Cameron. Is there ability to also go forward with the construction of Cameron at the same time if you go forward with Port Arthur? Is there enough craft labor and everything to do those coincide? And the second follow-up is on Port Arthur 2. Is there -- you talk about maybe selling down some of the equity ownership to finance it? Is there a desired level of ownership? And I'll leave it there. Jeff Martin : Yes, I appreciate the question. I would tell you that we're now forecasting an opportunity to take FID on Port Arthur Phase 1 in the first quarter. Hopefully, we'll have a fulsome update on that on our February call. And you'll recall that we've also forecasted taken FID on Cameron expansion in the middle of the summer or in the Q3. Once we go through the competitive feed process that we have ongoing. So there's no question that we're in a position in terms of trade craft and our expectation from our EPC contractors that we can deliver both projects at the same time. And then going back to Phase 2 of Port Arthur, we've talked about this a little bit. I think the most important thing here for us is stay focused on Phase 1. The closer we get to take an FID on Phase 1, we're going to see the permitting process come together. We're going to crystallize some of the contract opportunities around Phase 2. And remember, the real strategic opportunity at Port Arthur is the ability to continue to scale it. So multiple phases become more probable once you get Phase 1 done. So I really appreciate the question. Anthony Crowdell : And just on Port Arthur, is there a desired level of ownership there? A \u2013 Jeff Martin : Look, I think you\u2019re going to see us take different approaches at different times. I think the best example we can give and we really appreciated being able to contribute the regas facility into the capital structure at Cameron and take effectively a carried interest. You\u2019re going to see us do that on Phase 1. Our job is to find the most efficient sources of capital and produce the highest returns on invested capital. And I think we\u2019ve got a really good plan in place that we\u2019re executing on Phase 1. We don\u2019t have a target ownership level for Phase 2 at this point. But that answer will be determined by how we can deliver the highest returns from the project. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Sure. I'd just like to take a moment and thank everyone for joining our call today. I know there were some competing calls at the same time. Per custom, if there are any follow-up items, please reach out to our IR team with any additional information. I'd also mention for the balance of the year. We look forward to meeting with many of you in Florida at the EEI Conference on the 13th and 14th, and we'll also be attending the Wells Fargo Conference in New York on December 7th and 8th. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Sempra\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego, we have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team. Before starting, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. I\u2019d also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, February 28, 2023 and it\u2019s important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Glen and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased with our accomplishments in 2022 and in large measure it gives us added confidence in our future performance. In 2023, we will be celebrating our 25th anniversary and across our management team, we are pursuing future opportunities with a lot of optimism. For purposes of today\u2019s call, I will provide summary comments on our performance recap our business strategy and frame our success in terms of our accomplishments over the last half decade. Then Trevor and Justin will review our business and financial accomplishments in greater detail and we will reserve time for your questions. Let me start with Sempra Infrastructure. In 2022, the United States reached an important milestone as an energy exporter. It was the first year that our country became the top exporter of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, while also leading the LNG industry and new offtake contracts that support future development. This supports our view that U.S. LNG exports will more than double by the end of the decade. At Sempra Infrastructure, we built an exciting backlog of LNG development projects that are expected to support that forecasted growth. As one example, Sempra Infrastructure signed more long-term SPAs and HOAs for LNG offtake in the fourth quarter of 2022 than any other market participant. In part, this has allowed us to stay on track in meeting our goal of taking a final investment decision on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 before the end of the quarter. Outside of our LNG business, we see the continued need to expand and modernize North America\u2019s energy networks, particularly in California and Texas. There is a common opportunity set in front of each of our business platforms focused on investments in modern energy infrastructure that accelerate electrification and the transition to cleaner fuels. We expect significant opportunities for investment across all three growth platforms and are affirming our full year 2023 and EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20. Additionally, on the basis of this future opportunity set, we are reiterating our long-term forecast of a 6% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth rate. Consistent with our past practice, our long-term forecast uses the midpoint of current year guidance and is anchored by strong projected rate base growth at our California and Texas utilities. Given Encore\u2019s ongoing rate case, I also want to note that we plan to share an updated 5-year capital plan as well as our EPS guidance range for 2024 on our first quarter earnings call. Please turn to the next slide. At Sempra, our high-performance culture, one that is centered around safety and operational excellence, is the foundation for delivering on our mission to build a premier North American energy infrastructure company. Our corporate strategy guides our business activities and continues to be validated by the strength of our overall financial performance. In recent years, we have grown the business, strengthened the balance sheet, delivered an attractive dividend and meaningfully increased our rate base, which continues to be a principal driver in our future growth. Looking ahead, our team is excited about the future in part is because we expect our culture and commitment to excellence will continue creating value through the end of the decade as we extend our position as a leader in the markets we serve and continue to invest in our employees. Please turn to the next slide. Since 2017, we\u2019ve executed on our strategy to simplify our business model, build our leadership position in some of the largest economic markets in North America and improve our financial performance. We\u2019ve streamlined our portfolio, exited non-core businesses and extended our regulated utility footprint into Texas by acquiring an ownership stake in Oncor and InfraREIT. Through this strategic repositioning, we\u2019ve been successful in creating greater scale across our franchise and new growth opportunities. To add context around our financial accomplishments since 2017, we have doubled our adjusted earnings, significantly exceeded a compound annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%, increased our combined utility rate base in California and Texas by 300%, all while supporting our balance sheet and maintaining a balanced 50-50 capital structure. It\u2019s also important to note that our commitment to this more simplified business strategy has resulted in a strengthened market position, improved business mix, enhanced quality of cash flows and perhaps, most importantly, improved visibility to future growth. Today, in many ways, it is pride in our past that gives us confidence in our future is from Sempra\u2019s rich tradition of serving others that we understand our role in society and how we can best meet the expectations of a growing list of stakeholders. While much has changed over the last quarter century, our vision delivering energy with purpose has remained constant as we embrace each new challenge as an opportunity to create innovative forward-looking solutions. To be clear, this is an important time for our company. At Sempra, we understand that modern energy infrastructure is a great enabler of prosperity, health and well-being for billions of people around the world. That is why Sempra is pursuing the dual opportunities of advancing decarbonization and helping to deliver energy security globally, all while improving the resiliency of how we deliver energy in our core markets. With that, I will turn the call over to Trevor to discuss business and financial updates. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. What we would like to do is update you on three things. First, I will provide business updates on Sempra California and Sempra Texas then Justin will discuss Sempra Infrastructure, including notable progress on our LNG export projects, and then I\u2019ll wrap up with a review of our financial results. Let me start with Sempra California. Community safety is a core tenet of our culture, and I\u2019m proud to highlight that in 2022, SDG&E completed the hardening of 100% of its Tier 3 high-fire threat district transmission infrastructure. This has been long journey that reflects the dedicated efforts of our employees, extending across more than a decade and have significantly improved community safety. In November, SDG&E received a final decision from the CPUC maintaining its 2022 cost of capital rates of return. In December, SDG&E and SoCalGas received a final decision authorizing the 2023 cost of capital, which preserved both companies\u2019 equity layers at 52% and updated SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 ROE to 9.95% and 9.8%, respectively, through 2025. Last year, we announced the Angeles Link hydrogen proposal. In December, SoCalGas received CPUC approval to establish a memorandum account that allows the company to track the costs of performing Phase 1 feasibility studies. This is an important milestone in evaluating new opportunities to advance California\u2019s decarbonization goals. Moreover, the CPUC directed SoCalGas to include this as part of California\u2019s application to the U.S. Department of Energy for Hydrogen Hub federal funding. SoCalGas believes Angeles Link has the potential to serve a significant strategic role in supporting the build-out of a full scale Hydrogen Hub and the transition to a green hydrogen economy in Southern California. As proposed, this would be one of the largest hydrogen infrastructure hubs in the U.S. and would support the decarbonization of hard to electrify sectors in the Greater Los Angeles region, which is one of the largest manufacturing areas in the country. Also, SDG&E and SoCalGas are working closely with their customers and regulators to help mitigate the impacts of unusually high winter prices for natural gas, which has been a challenge all across the western region of the country. From the state of Washington to Wyoming and Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and California, the Western region experienced a difficult price environment. Fortunately, natural gas prices across the country have dropped more than 65% since December. And here in Southern California, our utilities have also seen price declines in recent weeks and expect that trend to continue, some materials from a recent CPUC on bank as well as a summary of the programs that SDG&E and SoCalGas have in place to support their customers, are included in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation. Finally, the ongoing general rate cases at SDG&E and SoCalGas established the foundation for meeting the future needs of our customers. It is also important to note that our filings are well aligned with the state\u2019s clean energy, safety and reliability goals, and we expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with retroactive treatment to the beginning of the year. Moving to Sempra Texas, I am happy to report that Oncor achieved strong employee safety results in 2022, which is a testament to the high-performing culture and operational excellence at our Texas platform. In fact, in a year marked by extreme weather, Oncor had a nearly 5% improvement in its SAIDI reliability score. On the transmission side, Oncor set another company record with 280 new annual interconnection requests in 2022, which is a 30% increase compared to 2021. To put this into context, 2021 was also a record year for the company, which as you think about it, further underscores the scale of growth that continues to come on Oncor system. In 2022, Oncor built or hardened nearly 2,000 miles of T&D lines across its service territory and connected over 2,000 megawatts of wind and solar generation to the grid. By the end of 2022, cumulative connections to Oncor system totaled over 18,000 megawatts of wind and solar generation, representing nearly 40% of ERCOT\u2019s total wind and solar resources. The momentum of transmission and distribution growth this year was driven by continued high demand for renewables and strong demographic and premise growth across Encore service territory. Oncor\u2019s rate case is on the PUCT open meeting agenda for March 9, and we expect a final order to be voted out in the next 4 to 6 weeks. Oncor has a track record of working constructively with the regulators for the benefit of its customers and to advance the key public policy priorities of the state. In part, these considerations support our view that Oncor will receive a constructive rate case outcome. Since the public proceedings are ongoing, Oncor has not unveiled their new capital plan. In conjunction with its final rate case, Oncor expects to review an updated capital plan with its Board. Afterwards, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we expect to publish our updated 5-year capital plan, which will most likely occur on our first quarter earnings call. I will turn it over to Justin to provide updates for Sempra Infrastructure and progress on development at Port Arthur Phase 1 and Cameron LNG Phase 2. Justin Bird : Thanks, Trevor. I\u2019m excited about Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s recent accomplishments and want to highlight some of our key achievements. Sempra Infrastructure has seen a solid year of commercial activity with robust LNG, cross-border renewables and pipeline infrastructure demand, creating a foundation for future growth. During the year, Sempra Infrastructure brought assets online within its Clean Power and Energy Networks businesses, while operations at its Cameron LNG Phase 1 terminal exceeded production targets. On the Pacific Coast, we continue to expect ECA LNG Phase 1 commercial operations to commence in the summer of 2025. Also, both ECA LNG Phase 2 and Vista Pacifico LNG received DOE approvals to re-export U.S.-sourced natural gas from Mexico in the form of LNG to non-free trade agreement countries. Please turn to the next slide. As you all know, we continue to advance our strategy of building out a dual market platform that allows us to efficiently deliver LNG to customers in the Atlantic and Pacific regions. To that end, I am excited to say we have completed the marketing phase for Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. We have carefully structured this development project to reduce risk by fully contracting the long-term offtake securing a fixed price EPC and identifying world-class development partners. In November 2022, we announced the execution of definitive agreements with ConocoPhillips, pursuant to which they would acquire a 30% ownership interest in Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 and take 5 MTPA of offtake from the project. In January, we announced that Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was fully subscribed at 10.5 Mtpa of definitive long-term take-or-pay contracts with world-class counterparties. We also have a fixed price turnkey EPC contract with arguably the most experienced LNG EPC provider in the U.S., Bechtel. With the completion of marketing and execution of the EPC contract, we\u2019re now focused on finalizing the project level debt and equity financing. On the basis of the current financing efforts that are underway, we aim to efficiently raise lower-cost capital and protect Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s investment-grade balance sheet. We are targeting Sempra Infrastructure Partners\u2019 ownership in the project of between 20% and 30% with ConocoPhillips owning 30% and the balance being sold in the form of a non-controlling interest to one or more investors. This is an exciting project. In this initial phase, we\u2019re aiming to generate equity returns in the mid-teens while preserving Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s investment grade rating and reducing our equity contributions to the project. As we approach FID, we continue to focus on striking the right balance of efficient financing, risk mitigation and retention of upside from future project cash flows and earnings. Over the past decade, we\u2019ve successfully built LNG export and other large infrastructure facilities, demonstrating our deep development expertise and capabilities to build world-class infrastructure. I believe this experience serves us well as we aim to bring Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 to FID through construction and ultimately to commercial operations as we execute on our goal of delivering cleaner, more secure U.S. natural gas to global markets. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to Cameron LNG Phase 2. As a reminder, this project is also competitively positioned on the Gulf Coast to export LNG to Europe and Asia. And given that as a brownfield facility, it has a distinct advantage to produce competitively priced LNG. The expansion project remains on track as we advance our key work streams. We outlined last year that our activities are focused primarily on completing the FERC amendment, advancing marketing efforts with the goal of securing long-term offtake agreements and completing the competitive feed process. On the regulatory front, the FERC commitment process that supports the transition from gas turbines to electric drives is progressing well. We received the environmental assessment from FERC citing no adverse impact, which is a positive step toward securing the final authorizations. Turning to marketing. 100% of the expected offtake is subscribed under HOAs our existing partners will take their 50% of production and SI\u2019s 50% of volumes is already subscribed under existing HOAs on a back-to-back basis. Next, on engineering, as we have talked about in the past, we\u2019re running a competitive feed process between Bechtel and a JGC Zahra joint venture. This process is on track to be completed in the summer of this year, and we would expect to make a final investment decision shortly thereafter. Please turn to the next slide, where I\u2019ll turn it back over to Trevor to discuss Sempra\u2019s financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra\u2019s financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $438 million or $1.39 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $604 million or $1.90 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2022 earnings were $743 million or $2.35 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings of $688 million or $2.16 per share. Full year 2022 GAAP earnings were $2.94 billion or $6.62 per share. This compares to 2021 GAAP earnings of $1.254 billion or $4.01 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2022 earnings were $2.915 billion or $9.21 per share. This compares favorably to our previous full year 2021 adjusted earnings of $2.637 billion or $8.43 per share. As a reminder, 2022 includes the minority interest sale of Sempra Infrastructure to ADIA that closed in June of 2022. Even after considering this minority interest sale, our strong performance and growing adjusted earnings demonstrate our ability to generate value for our shareholders while providing safe and reliable service to our customers. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in full year 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following : at Sempra California, $161 million of higher earnings from higher CPUC base operating margin, net of higher operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas and $46 million of higher flow-through items related to repairs deduction allowances and self-developed software and other items recorded as a reduction to income tax at SDG&E, partially offset by $52 million of higher net interest expense primarily due to higher debt balances at SDG&E and SoCalGas. At Sempra Texas Utilities, $120 million of higher equity earnings primarily due to rate updates at Oncor to reflect increases in invested capital, higher consumption and customer growth. And at Sempra Infrastructure, $160 million of higher earnings driven by excess production at Cameron LNG Phase 1 and strong production from existing energy networks and clean power assets as well as new assets placed into service and $110 million of higher income tax benefits, partially offset by $250 million of lower earnings driven by the sale of our minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure. Please turn to the next slide. As we near the end of our prepared remarks today, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to bring this all together and highlight Sempra\u2019s investment proposition. We\u2019ve built a high-performing energy infrastructure company that is well positioned in some of North America\u2019s most attractive markets. We\u2019re focused on strategically deploying capital in what we believe is within the higher-value, lower-risk portion of the energy value chain and provides significant visibility to growth and shareholder value. At our utilities, this year, we will continue to be focused on advancing our rate cases, which center around making the needed investments to further safety, reliability and decarbonization to serve customers. For Sempra Infrastructure, we\u2019re nearing FID for a large-scale LNG project in Texas, dedicated to helping provide energy security to our country\u2019s allies and directly supporting the energy transition. With that said, at Sempra, there are a number of open items to be completed this spring, including finalizing the Oncor base rate case and taking FID on Port Arthur Phase 1. That is why, as mentioned earlier, we plan to update our 5-year capital plan on our first quarter earnings call in May and also expect to issue our EPS guidance for 2024 at that time. Our work today gives us confidence in our ability to continue the build-out of one of the largest and most competitive energy networks in North America. By advancing our position as a leader in technology and innovation, we are better positioned to serve customers and create value for our shareholders. That\u2019s why today, we\u2019re announcing the approval by our Board of Directors of a quarterly dividend of $1.19 per common share, a projected annualized dividend of $4.76. We look forward to continuing our commitment to creating and returning value to our owners by building the energy networks of the future. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now stop and open the line to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Jeff Martin : Hi, good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, Jeff. Just maybe just more broadly on the 6% to 8% growth CAGR from the \u201823 midpoint based. I mean I guess the question is the cadence of growth that is embedded in that long-term CAGR. And the reason why I ask is the \u201822 to \u201823 original midpoints reflect 6% growth in \u201823. And obviously, we don\u2019t have \u201824 guidance today. So do you anticipate some step-up in growth with maybe regulatory outcomes, SIP projects reaching commercial operations and getting some clarity on the upwards cost of capital revision in California as we move further in plan? Jeff Martin : Sure. Let me provide some context here. You did mention the step up from \u201822 to \u201823, which was about 9.25% growth. I\u2019ll give you a couple of things that I think will help you on this. One is when you look back over the last 1, 5, 10, 20-year periods of financial performance, we\u2019ve delivered EPS growth in the range of 6% to 8% or higher. In fact, over the last 5-year, Shar, we\u2019ve delivered a compound annual growth rate of right at around 11%. So I would also note, over those same periods of time, we\u2019ve outperformed our sector in total shareholder returns. Second, harking back to 2022, as you alluded to, our 5-year capital plan we launched last year was our largest ever at $36 billion. And you\u2019ll recall that over 90% of those dollars were allocated toward meeting our expected rate base growth. And we certainly \u2013 we think that will continue to be a big driver across the balance of the decade. But one of the reasons we have so much confidence in our long-term growth rate is because now we really have improved visibility to a portfolio of growth opportunities at Sempra Infrastructure over the same period. So we feel very good about our 6% to 8% growth rate. I think that we\u2019ve demonstrated over a long period of time we have the ability inside this organization to grow at a rate faster than that. And we\u2019ve certainly done that in the last 12 months than we\u2019ve done it over the last 5 years. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And Jeff, just \u2013 I was actually referring to the original midpoint on \u201822 from \u201823. But I appreciate, thank you for that clarity. Just on the \u201823 guide, I just want to make sure, is there \u2013 is it inclusive of sort of the headwinds around O&M, interest rates, cost of capital that we just saw in California. Just trying to get a sense a better idea of what\u2019s in and what\u2019s upside to \u201823 and whether there is any tail risks out there that we should be concerned about? Or is it just the fact that you want these events to close? Jeff Martin : Yes. I think it\u2019s a combination of both. You\u2019ll recall that when we set our 2023 guidance last February. We\u2019ve come back 12 months later, we\u2019ve affirmed that guidance. When you look at the 2022 results, obviously, it was record adjusted EPS for our company, really had strong safety results, strong operational results, executed a $7.8 billion capital plan, which we\u2019re really very pleased with. But I would note to your point, as we look to 2023, we are going to manage some headwinds, right? Number one, you referenced one of them which is the ROEs and our California utilities were adjusted down by 25 basis points. We are operating in a higher interest rate environment. Number three, and Trevor mentioned this one, non-controlling interest at Sempra Infrastructure today is 10% higher than it was at this time last year. And we\u2019re managing some different potential outcomes associated with the Oncor base review. That said, the reason we\u2019re confident about our 2023 numbers, and we\u2019re going to work hard to beat them is. We have a great plan of execution. It causes us to have a lot of confidence in our guidance. And I would also mention to your earlier question, we have a visibility to one of our largest portfolios of opportunities in the future, and that\u2019s why we feel very good about the 6% to 8% growth rate. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. And then just lastly on the LNG side, Jeff, as you\u2019re getting closer to ECO COD, can you just maybe talk about how the economics of that project kind of stack up in the context of SIP similar returns and earnings contribution, pro rata versus chem or there sort of some headwinds from the inflationary pressures, interest rates, etcetera, more broadly. So how would the economics? Is that in line with other projects, especially Port Arthur as the next step is, that\u2019s the next big one. Jeff Martin : Well, thank you. We\u2019re certainly excited about Port Arthur. I noted in Justin\u2019s prepared remarks, I think he used the word exciting 4 or 5x. I think it reflects our excitement inside the company. As Sempra Infrastructure, you\u2019ve followed us for a long time, Shar. We tend to be very disciplined in how we allocate capital between shareholder distributions and new projects like Port Arthur. Sempra Infrastructure typically targets high single-digit to low double-digit unlevered returns. And we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we do this with the goal of maintaining portfolio equity returns in the mid-teens. We\u2019re very excited. I think one of the things Justin talked about is, we think we can give this project on time and on budget. But given the positive interest in the marketplace for the project, I would tell you the returns that I decided we think, are very reasonable. But 1 thing it\u2019s worth our audience tracking, which is we also expect to retain certain preferences and economics and the sell-down of our equity and asset optimization initiatives like you\u2019ve seen us do around debottlenecking, expansion projects and gas supply that could give us returns at levels well higher than our normal target. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. Thank you, guys so much. Appreciate it. I will see you soon. Jeff Martin : Yes. Thanks for joining the call. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Nicholas Campanella : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff Martin : Good morning. Nicholas Campanella : Good morning. Hey, I just wanted to round out the conversation on just how to think about growth past \u201823. When we think about the EPS CAGR off the \u201823 midpoint, does that already incorporate the 5-year CapEx view you\u2019ll give us on the first quarter? Does it assume anything for LNG development on top of ECA such as funding for Port Arthur and Cameron 2. Can you just give us a sense of how the next update can affect growth considerations? Thank you. Jeff Martin : Yes. I appreciate the question. I would remind folks that we brought back our 5-year forecast back in 2021. The convention we\u2019ve adopted over the last several years has been to work off the midpoint of our current year guidance, which we announced today we feel very solid about our 6% to 8% growth rate. And really, that\u2019s looking at the roll forward capital plan from last year of about $36 billion. I think what\u2019s exciting for us is we have the opportunity to improve that forecast. Certainly, Phase 1 of Port Arthur is important. And Allen and his team are doing a really good job of managing our rate case outcomes in Texas. So I would just say that, that 6% to 8% growth rate is something that looks conservative relative to our past performance. And I will tell you that one of the things we talked a little bit in my prepared remarks about how we have repositioned the business over the last 5 years, what\u2019s unique today is our visibility into future growth is better than it has been in the past. So, we want to get through a couple of big events here in the spring and come back with a more robust capital plan by our May call, and we look forward to having that conversation in greater detail. Nicholas Campanella : Okay. Thanks a lot for that. And then I just wanted to ask just capital allocation question. The dividend increase is 3.9%. We just noticed that maybe a little light compared to what you kind of executed on historically. Can you just give us a sense of what\u2019s driving that? How you are thinking about capital allocation regarding the dividend? And then also the buyback that you outlined last year, just given you have all these new growth opportunities in front of you that would be great. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Yes. That\u2019s a great question. I will tell you, one of the things that really differentiates good companies from average companies is how disciplined you are in capital allocation. And I will tell you, we certainly understand the importance of dividend to our investors, and that\u2019s why we have consistently grown it over the last 12 years. Our Board has established a projected payout ratio for us between 50% and 60%. What we announced today falls in the 53% range. And I would make a comment that over the last 10 years, we have averaged roughly a 7% increase to our dividend, which we feel great about. But remember, too, that we are investing in our businesses to support organic growth, and that is our most important initiative. And over our history, I think most people would say our focus has been on investing in opportunities to grow our business while balancing that with returning capital to shareholders, just like you talked about. So, you have seen us return capital in the form of share repurchases, and we have also been fairly aggressive about returning capital in the form of a dividend. So, I guess my concluding point would be in combination, that dividend growth and the planned growth we have in front of the company, we think this strategy has resulted in the relative outperformance of Sempra stock over the last 1-year, 5-year, 10-year and 20-year period relative to our index. We are committed to disciplined capital allocation in a strategic manner that results in increase in shareholder value. It is certainly a priority to our management team. Nicholas Campanella : Okay. And then if I could just sneak one last one in. Just the NCI sale around Port Arthur, can you just kind of give us a sense of how we should think about that timeline? Do you have to take FID first and then pursue it? Just how should investors think about that? Jeff Martin : Yes. I would say we focused on really the last two remaining items that we are working on right now is focusing on lined up our non-recourse debt and also the sell-down of equity, right. And I think if you think about historically, what we have communicated about how we finance projects. We do step one, we look at project level debt is non-recourse to our owners. Two, we leverage the benefit of partners at the project level. We are very pleased to have ConocoPhillips play in that role in Port Arthur. Third, we use capital calls from our partners at separate infrastructure partners. We have got ADIA and KKR and the capital structure and they are going to have an important role in helping us move this project forward. And then finally, as we are doing now, we look to bring in new sources of private equity capital to sell down our interest. So, for us, it\u2019s all about striking the right numbers to take FID, and you should expect us to execute in a way that economizers calls on our equity while striking the right balance of efficient financing, risk mitigation and retention of upside from future project cash flows. Nicholas Campanella : Thanks for all the color. Appreciate it. Jeff Martin : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Your line is open. Jeff Martin : Hi Anthony. Anthony Crowdell : Hey. Good afternoon Jeff. Good afternoon Trevor. Trevor Mihalik : How are you doing? Anthony Crowdell : Good. Hopefully, two easy ones. And I guess \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you mentioned it in Shar\u2019s question, but Slide 14, you guys talk about maybe basis differential in the Western gas market. Is that an investment opportunity for either the regulated utilities or SIP? Jeff Martin : I would go back to a couple of first principles here, which is we are very focused on building an infrastructure company. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we talked about the reposition of this business back in 2018 really around being an infrastructure business and really removing non-core assets and commodities from our business model. So, in the Western region right now, we are focused on working through this Western region gas event. And certainly, we are trying to do that from a customer perspective. We have been relatively aggressive about trying to ensure we are making the appropriate announcements to our customers and put some good programs in place. But no, we are not pursuing a basis differential opportunity. But I would think it might be helpful, Justin, talk about how we think about your asset position, particularly in Texas, Louisiana and Mexico. Justin Bird : Yes, sure. Thanks Jeff. I think \u2013 and I will hark into something that you said earlier, Jeff, that as a starting point, SI is really focused on long-term contracted cash flows from our infrastructure projects in Louisiana, Texas and Mexico. And I think there is two important points to remember there. One, we don\u2019t own infrastructure in the Western U.S. and two we work to avoid commodity exposure. As you think about ECA LNG in Baja, as you recall, when we took FID decision in 2020, we essentially leased transportation capacity that would allow natural gas to be delivered from the producing basins both in Texas and New Mexico to the project when it comes online in 2025. And in the interim, we look to offset those costs by utilizing that capacity to deliver gas to customers. But given our infrastructure focus, we do this by conservatively hedging our position well in advance, which reduces our market exposure. And you will notice, as you look in the \u201822 earnings on a GAAP basis, as a result of those hedges, we have unrealized mark-to-market losses of over $300 million, which represents the difference between our conservative hedges and the market price. So again, as an infrastructure company, we prefer to optimize recurring infrastructure cash flows and minimize our exposure to changes in commodity prices, essentially exchanging price volatility to get recurring cash flows. And I think you will see that trend continue. We are focused on long-term recurring cash flows from credit where the offtakers and that will be our focus at SI. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then if I could just follow-up probably also to you, Justin, on the Port Author Phase 1, enter the EPC contract, $10.5 billion fixed price. If you could just give us some more color maybe on the contract. Is there cost-plus agreement or any commodity exposure that maybe SIP or Sempra has with Bechtel, and I will leave it there? Justin Bird : Yes. Thanks Anthony. So yes, as we have said, that contract is for $10.5 billion. It is a fixed price. There is some escalation components in that as we move towards issuing a final notice to proceed. I think importantly, let me emphasize again, we are very proud of our selection of Bechtel. They have a history of building projects, LNG projects in the Gulf that have all been on-time, on-budget and have importantly provided production numbers in excess of what was guaranteed. As we look at our specific EPC contract, there are some very small pieces of that, that would float. But again, we have a contingency in place as does Bechtel to handle those adjustments. So, I think again, looking to Bechtel\u2019s history, they delivered on-time, on-budget, under fixed price EPC contract. So, we are very comfortable with the contract. And again, I will use my word again, I can\u2019t tell you how excited we are as we move towards FID prior to the end of this quarter. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks so much. Congratulations on the great quarter. Jeff Martin : Thanks Anthony. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rich Sunderland : Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Thank you for the time today. Jeff Martin : Hey Rich. Rich Sunderland : Sticking with some of the LNG questions here, I know in the past on the growth rate you have had LNG in the plan. And obviously, the business has changed a lot since then. I believe Port Arthur was upside to the growth rate last year. Just curious if that\u2019s still the case this year, or is Port Arthur now baked in as you approach FID. Jeff Martin : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. We are going to update our roll forward 5-year capital plan later this spring. Currently, we are working off of the plan we rolled out last year. We don\u2019t simply put projects in our plan unless they have reached FID. So, I would view Port Arthur as an upside to our long-term opportunities. Rich Sunderland : Got it. Very clear. Thank you. And then looking across a range of future LNG projects, are you seeing more interest from Asian buyers versus European buyers for incremental offtake, curious where interest stands? Jeff Martin : Yes. I would tell you the answer is both, right. So, you have gone through a really unique situation in Europe. Most of the contracts for Phase 1 are being launched off the basis of Europe. But I would also note in the Washington Post a few days ago, they talked about the highest ever approval rate for coal plants in China where they are launching 106 gigawatts of new coal plants. That\u2019s 82 new plants going into service. And between China and India, they burn about 70% of all the coal in the world. So, there is a big opportunity for energy insecurity in Asia. The long-term market opportunity remains an Asian opportunity. And the great news is we have got a platform that allows us to dispatch efficiently into the Atlantic and the Pacific. And I think that\u2019s one of the things that offtakers are excited about doing business with Sempra because of that. Rich Sunderland : Great. Thanks for the time today. Jeff Martin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Jeff Martin : Hi Craig. Craig Shere : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, I am often accused of getting over my skis, especially on LNG. But looking past PA1 and Cameron 2, first, could you discuss the logical pecking order at this time between Port Arthur 2, Vista Pacifico and ECA2. Jeff Martin : Sure, Craig. I will pass that to Justin, and maybe you can provide some view in terms of how you are thinking about the loading order for development. Justin Bird : Yes. Thanks Jeff. And Craig, I am never going to assume you don\u2019t have a lot of LNG experience. So, thanks for your question. I think as you look at the pecking order, again, it can always change. As you will note, about this time last year, the war in Ukraine changed, what we thought was, our pecking order at that time. But as I think about our opportunities going forward, let me start with Port Arthur Phase 2. I think there is a lot of excitement around a second phase at Port Arthur, would be brownfield, would clearly benefit from sharing of common facilities. And as I think about that development, there is a few key work streams, which again, is consistent with Craig, how we have always discussed about how we move forward our LNG projects. First, permitting, Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 has an application in the FERC and the FERC order is pending. Second is commercial. We have MOUs for volumes out of Phase 2 and are discussions with many parties to fill any outstanding volumes. Engineering and construction, we are in discussions with Bechtel about continuous construction and optimizing that process. And as we always do, we are engaged with the credit rating agencies to make sure as we think about financing these opportunities, we find them the most efficient way to finance taking into account credit and returns. So, that\u2019s kind of Port Arthur. If you ask me the pecking order, I think the second phase at Port Arthur would be next. As we think about Vista Pacifico, I think you are seeing some exciting developments there as we continue to work with the Mexican government and with CFE about really optimizing supply there. There is a lot of interest, as you might expect, given it\u2019s out of the Pacific Coast. And as we think about ECA LNG Phase 2, I think you have seen some also exciting developments. If you recall, we recently got our non-FTA permits for both Vista and ECA. The other thing that you may have noticed is we had an MOU that we announced with CFE and Carso, which would be an opportunity to bring additional gas volumes to the Baha area, which could expedite the development of ECA LNG Phase 2. So again, I hate to be the being accused of saying excited too much, but I think there are exciting opportunities in the rest of our LNG portfolio. Craig Shere : Great. And that kind of tees up a little bit my second question here. I guess on a macro basis in the United States, I am wondering, Justin, if you have some feel for after remarkable prior 12 months of contracting, what we might see in terms of a slowdown in the next year or 2 years? And what I am kind of referring to is that if some partially contracted projects were across the finish line, some peers, we could see 80-plus Mtpa of FIDs within 18 months. And we are just wondering if that\u2019s just more than the market needs just past mid-decade. Jeff Martin : Well, this is Jeff speaking. I will provide a couple of comments, and Justin, feel free to weigh in. We think our view across the decade is very similar with what\u2019s been put out by the EIA, which is forecasting 130% growth for U.S. LNG across the decade. The 80 million tons per annum that you referenced sounds about right, actually. I think actually the DOE might be forecasting slightly more than that. But remember, it\u2019s not just American LNG, we are competing against other markets, whether it\u2019s Australia or Qatar. There is certainly opportunities potentially at Mozambique. And remember, there are still volumes coming out of Russia, particularly on the North Coast as well as from South. And so, I think one of the things we have noticed is there is a tremendous demand for energy security and affordable sources of energy and natural gas has a very big runway internationally. We may see a decline here in the United States in different regions of the country, but it is a really big opportunity. I think the United States is viewed as a market that has security of supply, and we have got good counterparties and we have got good credit, and we have got deep capital markets. So, we are going to see the lion\u2019s share of LNG across the globe will be coming from the United States across this decade. Craig Shere : Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Sure. Just by way of a brief close, we know there are several investor conferences underway today. So, we very much appreciate everyone making time to join us. If there are any follow-up questions, per custom, always reach out to our IR team with any additional questions. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to Sempra's First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Sempra's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under the Investors section.  Here in San Diego, we have several members of our management team with us today, including: Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.  Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.  Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis. And we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.  We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, May 4, 2023. And it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.  With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you all for joining us today. We're excited to report that through the first 4 months of this year, we've accomplished several significant objectives that advance our business strategy and position the company for future success. We're off to a great start for this year. So what I'd like to do is provide you updates on several key business developments, growth opportunities over the next half decade and our EPS guidance for 2023 and 2024. After that Trevor and Justin will walk us through the business and financial achievements for our three growth platforms. And at the end of today's call, we'll reserve time for your questions.  Turning now to business developments. Oncor completed its base rate review last month with an updated ROE of 9.7% and a continuation of its existing equity layer of 42.5%. This constructive outcome provides strong support for Oncor's credit ratings and the expanded capital spending that's needed to meet the strong growth that's continuing to occur across its service territory.  Just last week, Oncor's Board met and reviewed the company's updated 5-year capital plan, which increased from roughly $15 billion to $19 billion. Oncor continues to see strong demand growth on its system and the need to make additional capital investments in transmission, distribution and new technology to continue improving safety and reliability. It's also important to note that we expect Oncor management will again refresh their long-term capital plan in the future with a view toward increasing it for the roll-forward 5-year period ending in 2028. Next, I'd like to mention that I'm pleased with the recent positive final investment decision at Port Arthur LNG. It's an important milestone that highlights the growing franchise value of Sempra Infrastructure and how well positioned that platform is for continued growth through the end of the decade.  We also have a lot of respect for ConocoPhillips and their management team. Their participation in the capital structure and offtake creates strong alignment with us for successful execution of the project. I would note as well that we're bullish about future LNG opportunities and expect the U.S. LNG capacity will grow annually at a double-digit clip through the end of the decade and that Sempra Infrastructure is well positioned to help the U.S. extend its leadership position in this area.  With these developments and a newly updated view of our planned capital spending across all three growth platforms, we're announcing Sempra's new 2023 to 2027 capital plan of $40 billion. Note, too, that this number only includes Sempra's proportionate ownership share of the capital being allocated to Oncor and Sempra Infrastructure, including Port Arthur LNG.  This year, we're celebrating Sempra's 25th anniversary. Our 20,000 employees are on a mission to build North America's leading energy infrastructure company. And it's our commitment to innovation, sustainability and leadership that guides our disciplined investment strategy. We aim to provide a growing and competitive dividend while also increasing the company's earnings per share over the long term at rates of growth that continue to trend above the industry average.  With that backdrop, we're affirming our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20 and issuing our full year 2024 EPS guidance range of $9.10 to $9.80. Together, this updated guidance and our new capital plan provide a solid foundation for our long-term projected 6% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth rate, which we're also affirming today. Now I'll turn the call over to Trevor to discuss our 5-year capital plan in more detail and provide a summary of our business and financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. We continue to see robust opportunities to invest in our utilities and infrastructure businesses, resulting in a $40 billion 5-year capital plan, which, as Jeff mentioned, is approximately $5 billion higher than the previous plan. I'll briefly summarize the expected spending at each business.  At Sempra California, their 5-year $21.4 billion capital plan is aligned with the state's priorities, which include safety, reliability, wildfire mitigation and sustainability with a focus on customer affordability. At Sempra Texas, the $15.3 billion capital plan includes our proportionate share of Oncor's $19 billion plan. Expected spending is in response to robust economic and demographic growth that is occurring across the state. As Jeff mentioned, we expect this capital plan will likely be revised upward in the future.  At Sempra Infrastructure, its new capital plan of $3.6 billion now includes Sempra's proportionate share of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, assuming Sempra Infrastructure's targeted 25% ownership level. To fund this growth, our customary approach is to start by reinvesting operating cash flows and raising debt financing at our regulated utilities in line with our authorized capital structures. We also evaluate other financing options, such as project-level debt and equity and asset sales before issuing common equity at the parent, all with the goal of solving for the lowest cost of capital. This approach is consistent with our past convention, where we've raised efficient financing through various asset and minority equity stake sales and our financing of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1.  Overall, this approach of sourcing the lowest cost of capital has allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet and continue to return capital through our growing dividend, all while providing flexibility to support infrastructure investments and deliver strong financial performance. The key takeaways for me as the CFO is that this is an exciting time for Sempra. And we have improved visibility to a portfolio of opportunities to capture strong growth across this decade. Please turn to the next slide. Over the next 5 years, our rate base is expected to increase at an average annual growth rate of 9% with over 70% dedicated to electric infrastructure. This growth reflects the positive macroeconomic tailwinds in our core markets and attractive regulatory environments.  Please turn to the next slide, where I'll speak to Sempra California's and Sempra Texas' accomplishments this quarter and their updated capital plans. Beginning with SoCalGas, you'll recall that in late 2022, the CPUC issued its decision for the Angeles Link memorandum account, which also directed SoCalGas to work with the state in its application to the DOE for hydrogen hub federal funding. In doing so, SoCalGas is honored to be a partner with more than 100 other entities to support California's application.  According to DOE, clean hydrogen hubs are expected to create a network of producers, consumers and local connected infrastructure to accelerate its implementation as a scalable clean energy source. SoCalGas is excited to support the state's application and looks forward to advancing the development of critical new infrastructure to support cleaner fuels for the benefit of its customers.  Further, customer affordability is a top priority. That's why SDG&E has been working closely with regulators to proactively develop solutions to reduce bills while continuing to enhance customer safety and reliability. SDG&E is advancing several initiatives that we believe will improve the overall affordability of its services.  First, it recently filed a joint proposal with the other two large investor-owned utilities in the state to redesign electric rates to include a fixed charge, which is intended to make electricity more affordable and encourage broader support for the electrification across the state. A proposed decision is expected in early 2024.  Also, SDG&E announced that it submitted an application to DOE seeking up to $100 million in federal matching funds to support the strategic undergrounding and hardening of overhead power lines in and near federally recognized tribal nations land within a service territory. SDG&E would invest an additional $100 million towards this effort, subject to approval from the CPUC. Exploring options to tap into federal funding for infrastructure hardening is a great example of how SDG&E is working to advance safety and reliability in a more cost-efficient manner for our customers.  Further, the California ISO recently issued a draft 20-year transmission outlook, which included several important projects in SDG&E's service territory that would support further renewable integration and overall grid reliability. Within the draft plan, the projects identified meet both reliability and policy objectives. The estimated cost of these projects are approximately $500 million based on reliability needs and an estimated $3 billion for projects consistent with state policy, which will be subject to a competitive bid process.  The draft plan is anticipated to be reviewed by the CISO Board later this month. We're encouraged to see their outlook is beginning to incorporate the higher expected electrification loads that will be needed to further decarbonize the state in accordance with state policies. Additionally, we expect the ongoing general rate cases at SDG&E and SoCalGas to establish the critical foundation for meeting the future needs of customers.  Importantly, our filings are centered around delivering cleaner energy, safely and reliability in alignment with California's sustainability goals. Based on the current schedule, we expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with rates retroactive to the beginning of that year.  In the meantime, SDG&E is continuing to execute a state-of-the-art wildfire mitigation plan, advancing the integration of utility storage and distributed resources and supporting electrification for the transportation sector. For SoCalGas, Scott and his team are focused on continuing to make improvements in the safety and integrity of the natural gas system while preparing its infrastructure for the delivery of cleaner fuels.  Please turn to the next slide. Moving to Sempra Texas. I'm pleased to report that Oncor is off to a strong start to the year. As Jeff mentioned, Oncor received a constructive final order for its base rate review in April, which preserved Oncor's equity layer at 42.5% and updated its ROE to 9.7%. As part of its decision, the commission recognized Oncor for its track record of excellent reliability of service, even with the extreme weather events that have occurred in its service territory.  This regulatory outcome has bolstered our confidence in the regulatory construct in the state. Having received the final order, Oncor updated its 5-year capital plan for 2023 through 2027 to $19 billion with a view toward making critical investments that support growth in the Texas economy and benefits customers through improved reliability of service.  Also, as a reminder, as part of Sempra's agreement to acquire Oncor in 2017, we committed to deploying $7.5 billion for the 5-year period from 2018 to 2022. At the end of 2022, Oncor had invested nearly $12 billion over that same period or nearly 60% more than its 2017 regulatory commitment. And now its 5-year plan anticipates $19 billion of investments, which is 2.5x its original regulatory commitment at the time of Sempra's investment.  Increases to Oncor's new capital plan are expected to support : growing generation interconnections, which are primarily related to renewables and clean power; strong premise growth; grid resilience and reliability; and technology and innovation advancements on the grid. You've heard us talk a lot about the attractiveness of this market in the past. In part, it's because Oncor benefits from the efficient capital recovery tracker mechanisms that are designed to limit lag associated with its investments.  There is now pending legislation that we are following that could improve Oncor's capital efficiency even further. In particular, SB 1015, if passed, would provide for two DCRF filings per year instead of the one that Oncor currently operates under. Passage of the bill would reduce regulatory lag and further support Oncor's efficient deployment of capital.  From an operational perspective, Oncor had another strong quarter with a 41% increase in active and retail transmission interconnection requests at the end of March compared to the same time last year. Also, premise growth continued to be robust in the first quarter, where Oncor connected 17,000 new premises.  Please turn to the next slide, where I will turn the call over to Justin to provide an update on Sempra Infrastructure. Justin Bird : Thanks, Trevor. Sempra Infrastructure had a strong first quarter of strategic accomplishments, particularly across its LNG and net-zero business lines, where continued demand for cleaner, more secure energy has strengthened the need for future development.  On the Gulf Coast, we've had several positive developments I want to highlight. I'll speak to Port Arthur in a moment. But first, in March, FERC approved Cameron LNG Phase 2's amendment to transition from gas turbines to electric drives. The completion of this work stream is critical to the development of the project. Given its competitive position to deliver LNG to customers in Europe and Asia, we remain confident in the attractive upside opportunity offered by this proposed expansion.  As a reminder, we expect that Cameron partners will take their share of offtake and SI will sell its share of volumes under back-to-back contracts. We continue to advance the competitive feed process. We've been targeting the completion of this process later this summer. Consistent with our disciplined approach to project development, we and the Cameron partners may extend this process beyond the targeted time frame to reduce construction risk, project cost and optimize the construction schedule through COD. We would expect to take FID after completing the FEED process as well as the project financing.  At Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, we reached a positive final investment decision in March. We closed on $6.8 billion of nonrecourse project debt and executed definitive equity financing agreements, which paves the way to advance the project. We continue to target closing our transaction with KKR this summer, pending regulatory approvals. The momentum on Phase 1 sets us up well for a potential Phase 2 expansion at the facility. And it's important to note that SI has retained rights over the associated development and common facilities. We're continuing development work on the proposed expansion. And last month, we were pleased to receive the environmental assessment from FERC, citing no adverse impact, another positive step in our development.  Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was a great example of our strategic approach of collaborating with world-class partners to identify and execute investments with long-term contracted cash flows, all with a view of creating incremental value to our owners. We're continuing to execute this strategy, capturing new opportunities to support energy security and the global energy transition.  In Sempra Infrastructure's new capital plan, we have included Sempra's targeted proportionate share of the $13 billion projected capital expenditures at Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. Sempra Infrastructure Partners is targeting a 20% to 30% ownership interest in the project. Based on Sempra's 70% ownership of Sempra Infrastructure Partners and assuming its 25% target ownership in the project, we're including approximately $2 billion in our capital plan.  As a reminder, our planning convention is to only include projects that have reached FID. And therefore, our plan does not currently include Cameron LNG Phase 2, Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 or other development opportunities where we haven't taken FID yet.  As you look to the robust growth opportunities that we've outlined in the appendix, I also would highlight we're now including the Port Arthur Louisiana Connector Pipeline. The pipeline would support 2 Bcf per day of feed gas supply for Port Arthur from the strategically located Gillis hub.  Please turn to the next slide. With FID at Port Arthur now behind us, I'm excited to provide you the first update on construction progress and how quickly teams, led by Bechtel, have mobilized to start construction. There are already approximately 450 people on site, including both the Bechtel and SI teams.  As a result, the site is changing daily. Clearing of the areas for the two LNG trains and two storage tanks is almost complete. And we've already started soil stabilization. We're doing this all with a firm eye on maintaining both a strong safety culture and deep community support for the project. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn it back over to Trevor to discuss Sempra's financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $969 million, or $3.07 per share. This compares to first quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $612 million, or $1.93 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2023 earnings were $922 million, or $2.92 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2022 earnings of $924 million, or $2.91 per share.  Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following. At Sempra California, $32 million of higher net interest expense at SoCalGas and SDG&E and lower income tax benefits at SoCalGas, primarily from flow-through items netted against lower income tax expense at SDG&E, primarily from flow-through items, partially offset by $14 million, primarily from higher CPUC and FERC base operating margin at SDG&E and lower CPUC base operating margin at SoCalGas. At Sempra Texas, $35 million of lower equity earnings, primarily due to higher depreciation expense, interest expense, O&M and lower revenue from decreased consumption, partially offset by higher revenues from rate updates and customer growth.  At Sempra Infrastructure, $56 million of lower earnings, driven by the sale of a minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure, more than offset by $71 million of higher earnings, primarily from the transportation business in Mexico, asset optimization and higher LNG diversion fees, partially offset by higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefit.  And other items at Sempra parent, which includes $36 million of lower costs, primarily driven by return on investments, supporting certain nonqualified benefit plans and higher income tax benefits, partially offset by higher net interest expense.  Please turn to the next slide. We have a clear strategy to build leading T&D infrastructure businesses in some of the most attractive markets in North America. And we have demonstrated a consistent ability to identify and deploy capital into attractive regulated and long-term contracted businesses. We have also taken concerted steps to simplify our business model into three growth platforms.  And this has improved our capital discipline and allowed us to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders over short- and long-term investment periods. Now with our updated capital plan and favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, paired with disciplined financial and operational execution, we believe we're well positioned to continue delivering an attractive dividend and compelling earnings per share growth.  Please turn to the next slide. On our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we outlined our commitment to resolving some key outstanding items. And in just 2 months, we've delivered on those priorities, including: Oncor receiving a constructive base rate review, supporting our view that Texas continues to be a very strong regulatory environment; taking FID and beginning construction at our LNG development project at Port Arthur, which sets the stage for additional growth at Sempra Infrastructure; announcing a record 5-year capital plan at Sempra of $40 billion, anchored by Oncor's new $19 billion capital plan; and issuing our 2024 EPS guidance range.  As we look ahead, we continue to prioritize creating value for our shareholders while supporting our customers. To deliver on this commitment, we're focused on the following : receiving a constructive outcome on our ongoing rate cases in California by the middle of next year, which will pave the way for the next 4 years of expanded investments in safety, reliability and sustainability; executing on our strategy of building modern energy networks underpinned by our new record 5-year capital plan; and continuing to capture incremental capital opportunities at Sempra Infrastructure from our growing development pipeline of LNG and other large-scale infrastructure projects.  As I've talked about this before, delivering in these areas provides enhanced visibility to future growth and, coupled with our strong position in highly attractive markets, gives us confidence in our ability to create meaningful value for our shareholders through the end of this decade. With that, this concludes our prepared remarks. And we will now stop and open the line to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Shahriar Pourreza : Just a couple of quick ones here. Just on -- are you including any outcomes in Texas legislation as we've seen build advances, any of this in your '23 or '24 numbers? And I guess, how quickly would you seek to adjust the plans and filings to reflect any changes from legislators, especially items that reduce ROE lag or implement a resiliency planning framework, et cetera? Jeffrey Martin : Thank you, Shar. Our approach has been to basically put together a 2023 update as well as a 2024 plan. It contemplates a number of outcomes. And I would say, independent of those outcomes in Texas, we would stick to the same plan we have on The Street now. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. But so the Texas legislation is not in the numbers, I just wanted to confirm that. Jeffrey Martin : Our current expectation, and we're going to -- we don't want to front-run the legislature, is that we do get some constructive outcomes. And we expect that the DCRF benefit, if it were to pass, is within the range and currently in the plan. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Got it. And then just on the growth rate, as you guys start reaching COD on ECA and reaching full earnings run rates over '25 and '26 and Port Arthur in '27, 9% rate base growth in your 5-year plan and contributions from FID projects, cost of capital trips, I guess, you seem to have a lot more tailwinds than tail risks in that 6% to 8%. I guess, what are we missing? Are there other drags we should be thinking about? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, it's a great question. One of the things we've talked about internally is you would expect your earnings growth over time to pretty much track your capital growth over time. So that's one of the reasons we have a lot of confidence in that 6% to 8% range. But I would actually take the opportunity, Shar, to make two other comments here. First, one of the things we oftentimes tell our investors are that our past financial results should be a good indicator of our future performance. I think you and I have had this conversation before. But over the past 10- and 20-year periods, we've consistently been able to grow our earnings per share at rates and the rates of roughly 7% to 8%. And even more recently, in the 5-year period, you'll recall that we've been able to grow our earnings per share at an annual growth rate of just over 10%.  So to your point, when you start looking forward, we have reaffirmed our 6% to 8% EPS growth rate. And I've always wanted to be very clear. It's not a quarter-by-quarter or year-over-year type of forecast. We're really truly focused, as you point out, on growing the business over the long term and particularly through the end of the decade.  So from my perspective as the CEO, I think the takeaway from today's call is that our announcement of a $40 billion capital plan makes us even more confident in our long-term forecast. And I would tell you through the end of the decade, given all the opportunities that are in front of us, and you outlined many of them, I would be disappointed if we didn't exceed the high end of that range. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. That's what I was trying to get at. Very clear cut, and congrats on the execution seriously. Jeffrey Martin : Thanks, Shar. We appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Yes, a couple of questions. So just could you talk to your funding plan for the higher CapEx? And I guess, specifically, it looks like in the appendix that there's some additional shares in the '24 guide. Could you just talk to what's driving that and the like? Jeffrey Martin : Sure, I'd be glad to. We've got Trevor with us. And maybe, Trevor, you could take a step back and give us an overview of the financing plan. Trevor Mihalik : Yes, sure, Jeff. I'd be happy to. So Steve, if you take back and you look over the last 5 years, we really have taken steps to strengthen our balance sheet and our credit metrics. And we did include kind of a summary in the appendix of the slide deck of each of the businesses on their credit carrying a stable outlook. But as part of that process, we've also developed an efficient loading order when you look at seeing how we source the lowest cost of capital to fund these businesses. So first, we've taken concrete steps to simplify the business and then to sell non-core assets. And then we've recycled that into new investments. And that process really occurs on a routine basis.  Secondly, we do evaluate debt and equity at the project level. And Steve, a good example of that would be what we recently did at Port Arthur with that announcement, where we just circled over about $10 billion of third-party debt and equity.  And then third, we've also had success in efficiently raising capital at our operating companies. And there, you saw us do that with KKR and ADIA by bringing them into the capital structure of SI, which has allowed us to raise over $5 billion.  And then finally, we can always raise debt and equity at the parent level if we determine that's in the best interest of our shareholders. And so bottom line is we're always focused on financing growth that is most beneficial to our shareholders. And we're pretty excited about this capital plan that's in front of us. Steven Fleishman : Okay. No, that's really helpful. But just specifically to the '24, the share count goes up. Is that some kind of plan for just like an ATM or something or... Trevor Mihalik : No, I think that's just some of the shares that are -- we've got in the plan for employee benefit plans and other things like that, so... Steven Fleishman : Okay. Got it. All right. That's very helpful. And then on Port Arthur, within the 2027, is it -- I mean, I know you're -- it's not like your stake is 25% and the like. But just is it -- is that first trained in for the whole year? Or does it not come until later in the year, so it's really not showing up in the last year of the plan yet? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, the way you thought about it, Steve, is train 1 comes online in 2027 with train 2 coming online in 2028. It would be -- it would not have a material impact on the 2027 number. Steven Fleishman : Right. So we're still seeing this growth without really seeing the [indiscernible] at Port Arthur? Jeffrey Martin : That's correct. And the way to think about that would be -- you're absolutely correct. And the way to think about that would be the full run rate for Phase 1 of Port Arthur would be in 2029. Steven Fleishman : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Look, let me just pick up on this earnings growth outlook here. And obviously, you guys gave us a '24 refresh here, nicely done. Should we expect growth in '25 to be maybe higher than the 6% to 8% range, given that, as you say, maybe 6% to 8% was a little less than '24? How do you think about the perhaps potential lumpiness of certain growth years? Or should we expect improvement to be maybe later-dated with LNG contributions, if you can expand on that? Jeffrey Martin : Yes, appreciate it. One of the comments I was making earlier was that we don't think about it in terms of quarters or years necessarily. The big issue that's needed to respond to you in 2025 is two things. It will be largely driven the outcome of our rate cases in California.  And as you know, a lot of people don't put out guidance when they mailed a rate case or have a rate case pending. We've included a reasonable set of expectations for 2024. But that outcome, Julien, will have a big impact on 2025. And the second thing I'd call your attention to is we're still forecasting kind of a half year convention for ECA Phase 1 with ECA expected to COD in the summer of that year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Yes, a lot of different moving pieces in the plan. Actually, if you can elaborate a little bit, you commented a little cryptically on Cameron, on perhaps reevaluating the timeline a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the inflationary front, labor, et cetera, to be able to get some of these LNG projects done?  Maybe a little bit of an updated timeline as you think to optimize that. And then related, I know there's been some challenges with the DOE here on extending timelines. Perhaps not entirely related, but I'm curious if you have any opinions on that related to the Cameron. Jeffrey Martin : Sure. Let me start with the policy shift, I think, that you're talking about. And I'll come back to the timing of some LNG projects and your inflationary question. So I'll take your second question first. You'll recall, Julien, that last year, the United States made a series of announcements with the EU and the United Kingdom about our country's support for their economic and energy security. We found that to be very constructive.  And more recently, that was updated at the G7 meeting, where the U.S. came forward and affirmed the importance of global LNG for energy security and climate goals. So I think the DOE was constructive in putting out both of those statements on behalf of the United States. We're certainly continuing to track the statements they've made here more recently. But our initial assessment is it highlights the significant value of derisked projects that are under construction or actively moving forward, like ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur.  And it probably discourages projects that are not materially progressing. So based on our experience in the sector, the market and the regulators tend to coalesce around projects that have a higher likelihood of being successful. And we continue to have confidence that our projects, in particular, are well positioned relative to that standard. On the issue of timelines, there's no question that interest expense and inflation and supply chain issues are impacting the whole industry. You would likewise expect that to be happening on the LNG side. But right now, we don't see any movement in terms of how we're thinking about future COD dates in some of our projects. But I thought it might be helpful to Justin to do two things. Maybe provide just a short update for Julien's benefit on Cameron expansion but also talk about the excitement you're seeing around interest in Port Arthur Phase 2. Justin Bird : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Let me start with Cameron Phase 2. So Julien, I think importantly, we and the partners continue to advance the project. And there's a lot of excitement around this expansion at Cameron. As we noted, we received FERC's approval of our amendment and now have a fully permitted project. On the offtake side, we expect the Cameron partners will take their share. And as we've said before, we will share -- sell our share of volumes on a back-to-back basis.  The competitive FEED process does continue to advance. I think the way I would clarify is that if we and the partners see the opportunity to, most importantly, accelerate the expected start of commercial operations and thus the cash flows, while at the same time, reducing project risk and cost, we're willing to spend a little bit more time upfront and we would be willing to extend the competitive FEED process. I guess, on an overall basis, my statement would be we continue to advance it. It's a priority project. And I'd say we and the partners are very committed to bring this forth. We think it's a great project.  I would say in terms of Port Arthur Phase 2, we've already had a successful start. We talked about the FID. And I would say, building on that success, we're seeing strong interest in Phase 2 expansion, which will create significant scale in the Gulf Coast. So we're continuing to work on marketing. We're continuing to work on permitting and construction. And then once those three are wrapped up and we have commercial arrangements, we'll move forward to the financing phase. But lots of excitement around Port Arthur Phase 2 and basically I would say the business in general. Jeffrey Martin : I would add to it as well, I made this comment we were talking about the policy issues from Washington. When you see projects like Phase 1 going forward, Julien, it's really been helpful to coalesce interest for Phase 2. So I think the thing that's really interesting is we're really drawing a lot of market interest for Phase 2 at this time. Operator : Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Just I have one quick clarification, hopefully. Trevor, just on the equity front, the plan through 2026, the former plan, you were very clear that there's no equity through 2026. And I appreciate you went through the different sources of financing in responding to Steve's question. Is that still the case through 2027 that is no equity? Or could we see equity at the Sempra consolidated level as you sort of advance through your capital plan? If you could just clarify that for us. Jeffrey Martin : Yes. And Durgesh, I'll be glad to take that. I mean, Trevor spoke to this issue of kind of the loading order we use to source lowest cost of capital. And the way I think about it, Durgesh, is in the equity markets, right, you have some companies that are really strong as income-based equity stories, some are growth stories. I think what we've tried to do is stake out a position in the utility space as being one of the leading growth and income stories.  So when you think about all the options today with higher rates and the more competitive corporate yields, I think we're well positioned to continue to attract investor interest around our story today. We've just raised our capital plan $5 billion. We've got a track record of being very, very efficient in our financing.  You're referencing prior years, where our plan was smaller. And there was no scenario where we thought we were going to issue equity. And I think what we're telling you now is, we've got a very robust plan. And we're going to go through the same loading order that Trevor described and solve for what we might need in 2027 or 2025 because it's dynamic, right?  You've got issues changing in Texas in the legislation. You've got a dynamic situation now, where Phase 2 of Port Arthur and Cameron expansion is not currently in the capital plan. But right now, as we see it, we've got a really good plan to execute on. And we've got a track record of sourcing the lowest cost of capital. And we're doing this through the lens of what drives the most values to our owners. I think that's the best way to respond to your question. Durgesh Chopra : That makes a ton of sense. I appreciate that clarification. Operator : And we have time for one more question. Our last question will come from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to kind of pivot towards the zero solution -- net-zero solutions, as you talked about before, from SIP. And wondering what updated thoughts you have on that side post passage of the IRA, if Louisiana gets primacy in Class VI wells for CCS, just wondering if you could update us there as far as potential customer interest in these services. Jeffrey Martin : Yes. Two things I'll mention, and I'll pass it to Justin to provide some overview of some of the projects we're looking at relating to the net-zero solutions business. One is something that I think is oftentimes overlooked is one of the most important bills that Biden administration passed earlier was the infrastructure bill, which really earmarks $8 billion or $9 billion for the formation of hydrogen hubs. We've talked about that in Trevor's prepared remarks. That's something that's got a lot of excitement both in Texas and also here in California. And our utilities are a big part of promoting particularly, the L.A. Basin, as an opportunity for hydrogen hubs. So I think that's something outside of the SI business, where you're going to expect to see leadership from Sempra's utilities. Relative to SI on the IRA bill, there are a number of things there that are helpful. Number one, it's really going to incent both solar and wind to come on to the system. That calls for more expansion of what we talked about in growth at Oncor as they look to basically meet the needs of extending transmission and distribution in their service territory.  But it also does a lot to help us in terms of our underground storage plans for carbon sequestration and also some of the hydrogen and green fuel opportunities that we're looking at in Sempra infrastructure. And maybe, Justin, you could talk about some of the progress that you're making on the development side. Justin Bird : Yes, will do. Jeremy, let me start by talking a little bit about Hackberry carbon storage. So as Jeff mentioned, we are actively pursuing solutions to enable net-zero GHG emission goals for energy and industrial facilities, including our own LNG facilities. The foundational initiative really is Hackberry. This is located in Hackberry, Louisiana. And it's in development.  And it was intended to basically permanently sequester carbon dioxide from the Cameron LNG joint venture and potentially other industrial facilities in Southwest Louisiana and Southwest Texas. As you mentioned, we have filed an application with EPA for Class VI. Louisiana is working with EPA about primacy. And we have announced a participation agreement with our Cameron LNG partners. And look, IRA is important. The $50 per ton to $85 per ton will support this project. We're also looking at potentially developing carbon sequestration and capture around the Port Arthur facility. So we think there's opportunities to not just reduce carbon output of our own facilities but potentially expand that to some of those other industrial facilities in the region.  On hydrogen hub, and I'll be brief, so we're looking at a lot of early-stage efforts. We are participating in three separate hubs that have been encouraged and have filed applications with the DOE. One is around the Port of Corpus Christi, another in the Gulf and others in Texas and Louisiana. So we are looking for opportunities to support hydrogen as one of the many clean molecules that we think will fuel the future. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. And just kind of... Jeffrey Martin : Go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Unless you had anything else to add there, I was just going to pivot to another question. Jeffrey Martin : No, please go ahead to the next question. Jeremy Tonet : And I was just pipping towards California here, how might efforts around income-based electric charges influence your affordability work in California? And is there anything unique about SDG&E's service story here that we should be thinking about relative to the other California IOUs? Jeffrey Martin : I don't think so. I mean, obviously, we currently have the lowest bills in the state relative to the other two investor-owned utilities. Part of that is we benefit from more moderate climate. But we've got kind of a three-part program that we're currently pursuing. And I would just -- I'm going to pass it to Kevin to address this in a second. He's our Group President for California. But one thing I would tell you that I think is important to remember, we're most successful when our customers are succeeding. And I will tell you that affordability is top of mind for our management team. This has been a tough 2- or 3-year period, where we've seen the cost of living increase. Inflation doesn't just impact the businesses, it impacts consumers.  So part of our social compact with our local community is we need to demonstrate every day how hard we're working to maintain low cost and that we're going to bat for them and looking for new and better ways to improve the affordability of our services. I think we're pretty excited about some of the programs we have underway. There's a lot more work to be done. But Kevin, perhaps you could summarize kind of the three-pronged attack that we have on affordability. Kevin Sagara : Yes. Thank you for that, Jeff. Yes, it's definitely a three-pronged attack, really focused around cost control, obtaining funding from parties other than our customers and rate reform. You mentioned the fixed charge effort, Jeremy. On the O&M front, we need to continue to be laser-focused on controlling costs and improving efficiency by streamlining and automating various business processes to gain efficiencies.  And this includes digitizing everything. A good example of how our culture of embracing technology translates to savings for our customers would be in the wildfire mitigation area, where our industry-leading program directly translates to significantly lower insurance premiums. A second focus would be around sourcing funds from outside our customers, like programs under the infrastructure bill. Trevor mentioned some of this in his remarks. We can seek funds outside of our customers, like the infrastructure bill, investment tax credits and other sources of federal funding and advocating for use of securitization as a tool to spread the cost of certain programs over more years.  And the third area of focus would be pushing for meaningful rate reform to make our customer bills more predictable, affordable and equitable. Examples of this would be advocating for the fixed charge for which there is an open proceeding currently at the CPUC and removing the public purpose program charges from our bills and into the state's general fund. So we always need to be laser-focused on affordability. And we have a number of work streams currently underway. Jeffrey Martin : Yes, the only thing I would add, too, Jeremy, is I think this affordability issue, particularly around this fixed charge that you referenced, what the state really wants to get to is a transition toward higher levels of electrification, particularly in the transportation space. And by moving to a fixed charge, it has the benefit of lowering the rate for electricity. And it makes it more competitive against the fuels that you see in transportation. So I think you've got several things taking place there, where we have a variety of programs which are intended to limit cost to consumers but also make electricity more competitive. And Sempra here in California and in Texas is strongly supporting electrification. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks. Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I'd just like to close by thanking everyone for joining today. I know we've got a lot of feedback through a lot of other competing calls this morning. So we appreciate everyone taking the time to join our call. Per custom, if there are any follow-up items, please take the time to reach out to our Investor Relations team with any additional questions. So this concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section.  We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.  Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.  Please note that these earnings per share amounts do not reflect the 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend that we announced earlier this morning. These amounts will be updated when we announce our third quarter and full year 2023 financial results. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, August 3, 2023, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Martin : Thank you all for joining us today. Earlier this summer, Sempra celebrated its 25th anniversary. While the company was founded in 1998, our operational routes at San Diego Gas & Electric and SoCalGas date back to the late 1800s. Over that time, we've embraced a strong commitment to serving others, delivering energy with purpose and bettering our communities.  Today, we have 3 premium growth platforms located in what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America. And looking forward to the next 25 years, we're really excited about the opportunities in front of us to modernize and expand our energy network so that we can deliver increasingly clean, affordable and reliable energy to our customers.  This year, we also published our 15th corporate sustainability report, emphasizing how our sustainable business practices help mitigate risk and unlock new opportunities as we continue executing on our record $40 billion 5-year capital plan, which, you'll recall, only includes Sempra's proportionate share of the capital. Today, Sempra has multiple tailwinds supporting our growth and income equity story, and we're confident in our ability to continue delivering high-quality earnings and dividend growth to our shareholders. That brings me back to the quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.88 and year-to-date 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $4.80. As you'll recall, we discussed the company's 2023 and 2024 guidance on our first quarter call in May. And based on the strength of our results across the first half of the year, we're pleased to affirm both our 2023 and 2024 guidance ranges and our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%.  Also, just yesterday, Sempra's Board approved a 2-for-1 stock split with the distribution date on August 21. The split does not impact our reported results for the second quarter, but it's important to note that in the third quarter, our historical and future financial results will reflect the post-split share count.  For the last several years, we've had one of the highest stock prices in the S&P 500 Utility Index. So with the planned split, we believe it will increase our trading volume and provide more accessibility for a broader group of investors to join us on our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company.  Please turn to the next slide. When Sempra began its journey in 1998, we had a relatively modest rate base of roughly $5 billion. And across the last 2.5 decades, we've been successful in transforming the size and scale of Sempra's overall portfolio while also simplifying our business model. Today, we own $45 billion of rate base and over $80 billion of assets with an investment focus on what we believe is the higher-value, lower-risk portion of the energy value chain or transmission and distribution assets.  I'd also note that Sempra's businesses are located in contiguous markets in the southwestern tier of North America and really benefit from strong economic growth across the region. Our strategy focuses on investing in regulated utilities that are decoupled from direct commodity exposure and long-term contracted energy infrastructure while avoiding the volatility associated with commodities and the uncertainties facing legacy generation facilities.  In other words, our core value proposition focuses on investing in the transmission and distribution backbone of North America and helping to efficiently move energy from producers to customers. Finally, our T&D utility investments benefit from constructive regulatory mechanisms with competitive returns on equity and the timely return of capital.  Sempra Infrastructure's business is underpinned by long-term contracts with world-class counterparties that are expected to provide steady recurring cash flows. Taken together, our 3 platforms provide great visibility to high-quality, long-term earnings growth which is aligned with our overall mission to continue building out the premier energy infrastructure company in North America.  Please turn to the next slide, where Trevor will walk you through both our business and financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. As we close the first half of the year, we're pleased with our financial results, which highlight the strength of our business model. For background, Sempra was formed via the merger of the parent companies of SDG&E and SoCalGas. And it's exciting to see how that foundation has allowed us to build a much larger and more successful company over time.  Today, we have a leading position with $24 billion of rate base within our Sempra California platform and serve nearly 26 million consumers. As electrification continues to increase, we're seeing significant load growth. Since 2022, SDG&E has experienced load growth of approximately 3%. This is the result of economic expansion and the trend of more business and consumer activity switching to electricity.  For example, the Port of San Diego recently unveiled the arrival of 2 all-electric cranes, which are the first of their kind to be unveiled in North America. The port also approved an electrification project, enabling cruise ships to plug into the grid while at berth as opposed to running their diesel engines, thereby significantly reducing emissions. The Port of San Diego is also expecting to receive the first all-electric tugboat to support further emission reductions across their operations. As these trends continue, we see opportunities for increased investment in infrastructure to support continued decarbonization in the region. Another great example is the ongoing electrification of transportation. California is leading the nation in electric vehicles, and SDG&E now has over 110,000 EVs in its service territory as of the first quarter, an increase of almost 35% compared to last year.  At Sempra, our employees have also been leaders in promoting electrification. Back in 2015, we set an internal goal to have 500 employees using electric vehicles as a primary means of transportation. We're pleased to report that we have recently exceeded the 1,000-employee mark, making us one of the first companies in Southern California to reach this milestone. And as electrification and customer adoption increases, we expect this to drive increased load growth in our service territory.  Further, with an increasingly complex grid, significant modernization is required to maintain safety and reliability. SDG&E's recent commissioning of 171 megawatts of utility-owned energy storage assets is another great example of utilizing technology to store and dispatch clean energy while reducing reliance on conventional gas-fired power plants.  To help ensure California can meet its reliability and clean energy goals, CAISO approved the 2022 to 2023 transmission plan in May, awarding SDG&E an estimated $500 million of new development projects. Also, in June, CAISO initiated a comprehensive bidding process with over $2 billion of additional projects located within SDG&E service territory.  At Sempra, we're one of the largest owners and operators of transmission assets in North America, and we believe SDG&E is well positioned to compete favorably. The company has a long track record of operating success here in Southern California, and we certainly believe our leadership and credibility in wildfire mitigation will also inform the quality and competitive nature of our bid.  Also in June, SDG&E announced that 80% of San Diego County customers are now receiving their electricity supplies from third-party providers. This is consistent with SDG&E's strategy of focusing more narrowly on modernizing the grid to efficiently move cleaner sources of energy to customers or what we refer to as an energy delivery model, much like Oncor in Texas. Turning to SoCalGas. The company released an expanded Clean Fuels analysis, indicating the need to plan and account for increased levels of clean, firm, dispatchable generation. Results highlight the potential reliability benefits of electric resource diversity and the value of hydrogen generation. The report also contemplates how cleaner fuels can be delivered safely and affordably through SoCalGas' existing and potentially new energy networks to help support electrification and decarbonization.  In connection with California's new Renewable Gas Procurement Standard, known as SB 1440, SoCalGas recently issued a new request for proposal for biomethane supply in the form of RNG and/or biosynthetic natural gas. At the end of 2022, RNG represented 5% of core gas deliveries at SoCalGas, and the mandated procurement through SB 1440 is expected to support the adoption of RNG in the state and, in turn, help SoCalGas meet its goal of 20% RNG in core customer deliveries by 2030.  This is a prime example of how SoCalGas is using its existing energy network to help the state decarbonize in a safe and affordable manner. Finally, our California GRCs are well underway. Our application in those cases are centered around delivering cleaner energy safely and reliably and in alignment with California's decarbonization goals.  Recently, SDG&E and SoCalGas participated in evidentiary hearings with interveners and submitted updated testimony, and the regulatory process continues to advance in a constructive manner. The next key milestone is opening briefs, which are scheduled to be filed in mid-August. We continue to expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024, with rates retroactive to the beginning of that year.  Please turn to the next slide. Turning to Texas. I first want to acknowledge the excessive heat that customers are currently enduring across the state while also recognizing the strong performance of the grid under some of the challenging conditions. Oncor's innovative and dedicated employees are the driving force maintaining reliable electric service despite challenging external factors, and they go to work each day with this commitment to excellence.  When we acquired just over 80% in Oncor 5 years ago, it had $11 billion of rate base, and Sempra made a regulatory commitment to support a minimum $7.4 billion 5-year capital plan. That same capital spend grew to be nearly $12 billion over that same period, and Oncor has nearly doubled its rate base to $21 billion as of the end of 2022. Over the past 5 years, Oncor's system has grown substantially, having added approximately 7,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines.  Earlier this year, Oncor increased its 2023 to 2027 capital plan to $19 billion. With continued strong economic growth and the recent positive legislation, we now certainly anticipate upside when we roll forward the new 5-year capital plan. We have long talked about the incredible macroeconomic growth in Texas and how it continues to drive additional capital investments.  To put Oncor's customer base into perspective, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex alone has a larger population than 38 states. Since June of this year, ERCOT set 6 new records for peak demand. And it's also noteworthy that over the past 7 years, there has been a 17% increase in ERCOT's peak demand. Specifically for Oncor, both C&I and residential customer demand continues to grow. A great example of this incremental C&I demand is the roughly $60 billion of chip manufacturing facilities that have begun construction in the cities of Sherman and Taylor over the past 18 months. These large manufacturing sites are expected to drive demand and require the build-out of significant new electrical infrastructure in the surrounding communities.  Finally, we also want to provide an update on a series of positive legislative outcomes that could add significant long-term value for Oncor and its customers by attracting additional capital to meet the state's growth and resiliency needs. Please turn to the next slide. Several bills were recently enacted in Texas, that are designed to provide enhanced recovery mechanisms for utilities and reduce regulatory lag. Together, these bills are expected to improve realized ROE and facilitate additional investment to support Texas' growth. We believe that the improved regulatory legislation, coupled with an incredible economic growth story, positions Oncor as one of the premier regulated T&D utilities in the country.  Starting with SB 1015, Oncor is now able to file a distribution capital tracker twice a year as opposed to only once. Similar to the existing regulatory mechanism for transmission investments, this should reduce regulatory lag and reflect Oncor's distribution investments in a more timely manner. This should improve both earnings and cash flows and is critical in markets like Texas, which is experiencing increased demand requiring rapid capital deployment.  Moving to HB 2555. This bill is designed to allow utilities to file a plan to harden and make its transmission and distribution systems more resilient to potential disruptions. Of note, the bill provides a separate regulatory mechanism for recovery of commission-approved resiliency investments.  The PUCT is currently drafting new rules to specify actual implementation, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. The rulemaking will lay out the procedural steps and time lines between future filings and the actual rate implementation. SB 1076, the Permitting Efficiency Bill, helps address the transmission grids' expansion needs by shortening the time to approve CCN applications from 12 months to 6 months.  Finally, HB 5066 directs ERCOT and the PUCT to develop plans for transmission projects to serve high-growth areas of Texas, including the electrification efforts in the Permian Basin, and could provide incremental investment opportunities for Oncor. Together, these constructive legislative outcomes enhance Oncor's ability to better serve customers and support system growth.  Please turn to the next slide, where I will turn the call over to Justin to provide an update on Sempra Infrastructure and Port Arthur. Justin Bird : Thank you, Trevor. Sempra Infrastructure was formed 2 years ago to streamline our business and bring together decades of energy infrastructure development and operating expertise under a single platform. Our increased scale positions us to capture new opportunities, create portfolio synergies and support the growth of North American energy markets.  There are 3 key trends that support these opportunities : decarbonization; energy security; and reshoring of manufacturing to North America, all of which give us confidence in the long-term growth profile of our business. Trade between the U.S. and Mexico continues to grow as a result of a strong reshoring trend. For example, a recent Reuters article identified more than $9 billion of capital that has flowed into Mexico from overseas manufacturers in the last 9 months.  And recently, Mexico surpassed Canada to become the largest trading partner of the U.S. Given our position as a leading player in North American energy infrastructure, we are well positioned to support growing cross-border trade with Mexico. More recently, we received several positive regulatory approvals across a number of our assets in Mexico, including in our energy networks and clean power segments. Moving to projects under construction. Our teams have been busy with over 10 million accumulated hours worked without a lost-time incident. We expect these projects will come online over time, with GRO expansion and ECA targeting COD in the second half of 2024 and the summer of 2025, respectively. And finally, Port Arthur Phase 1 is also advancing as expected and continues to target commercial operations of Train 1 and Train 2 in '27 and 28, respectively.  Turning to LNG development at Cameron Phase 2. We're at a stage in the competitive feed process where we have selected Bechtel to move forward to complete the remaining work. We are aligned with our partners to invest additional time upfront to reduce construction risks and project costs. We expect this process to continue through the fall, positioning us to take FID next year after satisfactorily finalizing the additional FEED work, securing project financing and any required regulatory approvals.  The selection of Bechtel is a significant milestone and we're implementing a strategy similar to what we did at Port Arthur to reduce overall cost and risk to deliver another world-class LNG project. Also, we are pleased with the marketing and development at Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 and are particularly encouraged by recent comments made by the FERC Chairman in support of energy infrastructure projects needed for reliability. Looking ahead, we're also expecting that Sempra Infrastructure Partners will finalize its project-level ownership stake in Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 at 28%. This is within the previously shared target range of 20% to 30%, and we expect the transaction with KKR to close in the third quarter.  Based on this updated ownership forecast for the project, Sempra Infrastructure Partners equity requirement is anticipated to be approximately $1.74 billion, and its proportionate share of EBITDA is estimated to be $460 million, which excludes certain upside economics such as Sempra Infrastructure's right to common facility payments from future phases.  Please turn to the next slide. At Port Arthur, we're developing a flagship energy hub that showcases the value of Sempra Infrastructure's world-class integrated capabilities. Sempra Infrastructure can leverage development and operational expertise across its portfolio to enhance the total value of Port Arthur. With 13 million tonnes per annum already under construction, Phase 2 is expected to double that capacity.  Further, we're leveraging the integrated capabilities of our business segments by developing the proposed Louisiana Connector pipeline, gas storage facilities, Titan Carbon Sequestration facility and an early-stage hydrogen project in the Port Arthur region. This comprehensive development approach supports the sustained growth of our energy infrastructure portfolio and is expected to help us capture a larger piece of the economics from the Port Arthur footprint.  At Port Arthur Phase 1, construction is well underway, with more than 2.7 million hours worked without a lost-time incident. Many of you are likely aware that our recent FERC request, which would enable Bechtel to expand staffing and work schedules to include 24-hour shifts, this provides for better optimization of construction activities, focusing on safety and allows for certain tasks to be completed at night, such as material deliveries and next-day site preparation. We also believe it will improve workflows and streamline schedules, so it's a mutually beneficial situation from our perspective.  With that, please turn to the next slide, where Trevor will discuss Sempra's financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $603 million or $1.91 per share. This compares to second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $559 million or $1.77 per share. On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2023 earnings were $594 million or $1.88 per share. This compares to our second quarter 2022 earnings of $626 million or $1.98 per share.  Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the second quarter 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following. At Sempra California, $32 million of higher CPUC base operating margin at SDG&E and higher amounts earned under certain CPUC regulatory incentive mechanisms and $14 million of higher CPUC net interest income earned on regulatory balances and higher tax benefits on flow-through items at SoCalGas, partially offset by net higher interest expense.  At Sempra Texas, $26 million of lower equity earnings from higher expenses and lower weather-driven consumption, offset by new base rates and customer growth. At Sempra Infrastructure, $40 million of higher earnings attributable to NCI, including the 10% sale of a minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to ADIA and higher development expense.  This was partially offset by $33 million of higher equity earnings, primarily from transportation tariffs, partially offset by lower asset optimization revenues, primarily from lower LNG diversion fees, and lower generation at TdM from a scheduled major maintenance. At Sempra Parent and Other, there were $45 million of higher costs, primarily driven by lower tax benefits and increased net interest expense, partially offset by net investment gains.  Please turn to the next slide. Over the past 25 years, Sempra has transformed from a regional Southern California utility to a leading North American energy infrastructure company and is positioned at the intersection of multiple macroeconomic growth trends. Along each step of the way, we've exhibited strong financial stewardship, overseeing meaningful earnings growth and return significant capital to owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  Looking ahead, we're focused on reaching a constructive outcome on our California rate cases, executing our record capital plan, demonstrating financial discipline and materially advancing critical infrastructure projects across our growth platforms. We've had a great start to the year that highlights our compelling growth story.  And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now stop, open the line and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Starting off on your commentary for Oncor, and I know you obviously -- you've had some assumptions in plan, but the Texas legislation is clearly a material support. For Oncor, we just saw a peer of yours raise CapEx while also kind of highlighting additional opportunities.  Can you just help us quantify how and when incremental benefits start getting embedded in plan? When we could start seeing some more of the CapEx benefits reflected, especially if you now have the ability to achieve allowed returns. So like could we further see updates as we approach your normal guidance update cycle later this year around Texas? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. Thank you for the question. And I certainly agree with you. This has been a very constructive legislative cycle in Texas, and I would start at the very beginning by really expressing our appreciation to Allen and his team. They deserve a lot of credit. They had been doing an exceptional job on the ground there. They're clearly seeing a lot more growth on the system, Shar, and I'll have Allen speak to some of that growth in a second.  But we would look forward to refreshing the Oncor plan this fall and providing future updates from Sempra's perspective in February. I do think you may find it helpful though, and I want to mention, as a rule of thumb, the DCRF legislation is expected to improve Oncor earnings in our estimation, around $70 million to $90 million on a full year basis, which falls within our current guidance.  But as I mentioned, we'll be updating for 2025 on our February call. Also, it may be helpful that as a ballpark reference, every incremental $100 million of capital added to the plant in Texas is expected to add approximately $0.01 of accretion to Sempra on a pre-split basis.  But Allen, it might be helpful to Shar, if you just provide a little bit of visibility into the growth that you're seeing on the system and your future expectations. Allen Nye : Yes, sure, Jeff. Growth continues to be just very, very strong, frankly, at record levels throughout our system and on all the metrics that we track. Just real quickly, premise growth is up about 10.5% quarter-over-quarter. We connected 21,000 approximately new premise in Q2 versus 19,000 same Q last year.  Transmission points of interconnection, or POIs, are incredibly strong. We added 92 new requests in Q2 for a total amount now in our Q of $720 million, which is a 37% increase over the same quarter last year. Broken down by retail and generation, retail requests for transmission points of interconnection are up around 22%, and based -- versus the same quarter last year. Generation, incredibly strong, up 50% over the last 12 months, and the total number of generation requests has actually doubled since 2020. So really strong growth on our transmission system.  West Texas remains very strong. The Far West Texas weather zone, peak increased by about 11.5% over the '22 peak. Peak on our Culberson transmission loop system out there, 21% year-over-year growth. And then just a couple more stats on things that aren't presently in the numbers. But our economic development team activities, new project requests were up 36% and request for information were up 32%. And all those things -- some of those things ultimately will work their way into the other numbers.  So we're very pleased with the continued economic expansion in Texas. We're very pleased with the continued very strong growth we're seeing on our system. If you look back, as Trevor said, we had $11.5 billion -- $11.7 billion in 2017 when the Sempra transaction with Oncor was announced. By the end of '22, we had about $20.8 billion.  We've already said we're doing about $3.6 billion in CapEx this year. Looking forward, we still have a $19 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 . We added $200 million in July. We got our Board to approve that. That is new capital that is not pulled forward. And then going into our October and first quarter Board meetings, we'll obviously do another CapEx plan refresh.  As Trevor said, we think there's likely to be upside there if we continue to see the growth that we're seeing now as well as the addition of a resiliency plan under HB 2555. That's presently a PUC rulemaking right now. So as Trevor said, we effectively doubled the rate base from the time the Sempra transaction was announced already.  Looking forward, we think it's possible we see a path to potentially doubling our rate base again in the next 5 to 6 years in a manner that really benefits our customers, results in a more resilient grid and benefits to the ERCOT market. All those things are obviously subject to the resiliency rulemaking, continuing to see strong growth in all the necessary Board actions. But Texas is -- has a great story, and we're very pleased to be a part of it, and I appreciate the question. Jeffrey Martin : So Shar, I'll just make the kind of concluding comment here that we've guided to $70 million to $90 million of incremental earnings associated with the DCF legislation. We talked about the accretion associated with the $100 million of capital in Texas.  And to highlight, I think, a couple of key things from Allen's comments. We've effectively doubled the rate base from 2017 to 2022. And I think Allen highlighted this, but there's more work to be done this fall with our planning team, but we have a real opportunity to more than double their rate base a second time in the next 5 to 6 years. So we've got some more planning work to be done. But we look forward to working with the Oncor Board and finalizing his roll-forward 5-year capital plan and certainly coming back and updating how we think about that from Sempra's perspective in February. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And lastly, Jeff, for me is, obviously, appreciate the stock split strategy to create some more liquidity. Obviously, the hope there is that it could eventually improve the valuation of the stock further. Are there sort of any other thoughts on strategy and optimization?  I mean Mexico has shown some desire to renationalize some energy industries. So has there been any interest on the legacy assets, especially as fuel storage and terminals were considered kind of a security need? Or does the SIP ownership structure kind of prohibit for any capital rotation decisions? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. Thank you, Shar. I'll kind of address both of those questions. I think the thought process behind the stock split is that we currently have the highest stock price in the S&P 500 Utility Index as we celebrate our 25th anniversary, this is the first time that we've announced a stock split for the company.  We certainly, to your point, think it will improve trading volumes and make the stock more accessible to a broader group of investors. So we view it just generally as a positive. And I think it really reflects management's bullish view on our future business prospects.  Turning to your issue of strategy, and I'll come back to Mexico. Our Board reviews our strategy at every Board meeting. It's been a top focus of our management team for the last 5 years. And it's allowed us to simplify our business model, improve our visibility to future growth.  When you think about the updates that Allen just provided and some of the things from our prepared remarks, we feel great about our growth and income story. And we have more work to do, as I indicated, with Allen's team to continue to think about the growth prospects in his business. Turning to Mexico. This kind of goes to the issue of what our prioritization is. And Justin mentioned this in his prepared remarks, but by combining Mexico with LNG, we created a business of larger scale with what are effectively midstream assets, with approximately 17 to 18 years' tenure in that overall contract portfolio. So it's a really high-quality portfolio of cash flows.  But as we look to finance our future, there's no question that we're going to continue to prioritize the growth in our utilities. We've demonstrated a willingness to sell down in the capital structure to SI. And I think we've done that quite efficiently in the past 2 years. And opportunities like you identified and continue to capital recycle, that's right in our wheelhouse.  So we'll continue to look for assets. They are less core to our future strategy. And that will always be something that we'll take a hard look at with Trevor and his team. So we feel good about our strategy going forward, and we appreciate the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Just maybe just looking at your year-to-date performance, just wanted to get your thoughts of that's tracking versus your expectations? I mean the EPS guidance range is still pretty wide. But clearly, you've exceeded my expectations, and I believe, Street estimates. So just how is the year shaping up versus your guidance range? Jeffrey Martin : Sure. Appreciate the question. You'll recall that in 2022, we really had a banner year. We reported around $9.21 of adjusted EPS. And reporting $4.80 for this year, we think, is a very strong number. So we think we've had a strong first half, a good first quarter. We feel great about our guidance.  Honestly, one of the things that we're focused on as a management team in Kevin's business is making sure that we execute very well around our rate cases here in the State of California. And we mentioned on the call that we expect to finalize that in the middle of next summer, with rates retroactive to January 1. So I think we feel very good about where we're at this year. I think it also signals strength to our guidance for next year. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Very strongly positioned, it sounds like. Okay. Then maybe just turning to California, and you mentioned the rate cases. But the CAISO opportunity, $500 million, is that incremental? Or is that embedded in the current CapEx plan?  And then you also highlighted $2 billion worth of projects, which are going to be competitively bid on. Maybe just talk to us as to how we see that embedded into your CapEx plans, just the time line and next steps there. Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I appreciate that question. We actually think, very similar to Texas, there's a very strong underlying growth story in California. We highlighted in our prepared remarks, but SDG&E has seen year-over-year demand growth of about 3%. I've been at the company since 2004. We've never seen that type of growth. And it really is a reflection of the electrification that's taken place in the state.  On your issue of whether the $500 million of incremental transmission projects are in our 5-year plan. Just remember, our current plan goes through 2027. We're going to roll that plan forward next February. This is really the CAISO's efforts to lock in the needed transmission, the need for the next 10 years.  So most of these projects will be outside of our current 5-year plan and be picked up in future periods. But I thought, Kevin, it might be helpful to give your perspective on the transmission opportunities here in the state and specifically the larger numbers that Durgesh just spoke to. Kevin Sagara : Thanks, Durgesh. Stepping back for a second, as Jeff's talking about it, clearly, the grids all across the country need significant upgrades as we move towards more electrification. In California, we've estimated that electric demand will more than double by 2045, with commensurate investments in grids. And as you mentioned, we're seeing that kind of load growth in San Diego already with a lot of adoption around electric vehicles.  So we're really excited about this recent announcement for the CAISO to add $7 billion. This is just like an incremental $7 billion of transmission opportunities. And as Trevor mentioned, $0.5 billion has already been directly awarded to SDG&E, and we're going to bid on those $2 billion to $3 billion of other projects.  And I'd note that across the Sempra family of companies, we're one of the largest owners and operators of high-voltage electric transmission in the country and really well positioned to be successful here in California as California continues this path of aggressive, aggressive investments to enhance and facilitate electrification. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Just a quick follow-up. Is there a time line on that? The $2 billion worth of projects that you mentioned, over what time frame is that going to be awarded? Kevin Sagara : Well, it's going to be -- I think there's going to be a short list close to winter in December and then with something awarded early next year. So I think more to follow here, but there's a process that CAISO is going to follow. And like I said, I'm pretty optimistic, and we're going to be very competitive. Operator : Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. If I can focus first on the LNG side, if you don't mind. I just wanted to understand a little bit of the push out in the time line on the Cameron side. Clearly, this has been, in some senses, articulated previously. But as you think about getting clarity on time line today on when to move forward, are you kind of waiting for inflation to moderate?  Are you waiting for certain milestones to be achieved here with your new partner, with Bechtel? Or are there other considerations? Just to kind of understand the shift to '24 now, but also the input parameters to narrow that in a little bit more precise. Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I'll make a few comments. I'll pass it to Justin maybe to provide a larger overview of his LNG development program. But I would just start by saying, Julien, the best way to think about it is we were on a call very similar to this in August of last year where we were talking about the potential for Port Arthur Phase 1 to leapfrog Cameron. And we were not, at that time, prepared to make an FID estimate for Port Arthur, but we felt good about the progress.  We're probably in a similar position today. We've got more work to be done on both of our brownfield projects, Cameron expansion as well as Port Arthur 2, but we're making significant progress. We're very excited to have selected Bechtel. Bechtel is doing a wonderful job, and he's been on site at Port Arthur for probably close to 5 years at this point.  So I think that's a big step forward for us to have Bechtel in-house working with us on finalizing cost and design work. And Justin, maybe you could do 2 things, update us on the overall LNG portfolio for Julien's benefit and maybe provide additional details about how you're thinking about timing. Justin Bird : Great. Well, thank you, Julien. Let me take a step back, as Jeff mentioned, again, our core strategy is to build an LNG infrastructure business. And that would be a business that offers customers LNG volumes from both the Pacific and Gulf Coast. And as you think about where we are to date, Cameron Phase 1 is producing in excess of 100% of its expected volumes. ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur Phase 1 are under construction, and both are proceeding safely and on schedule.  And as you look at our LNG development projects, look, we're very excited about the opportunity set in front of us. At Cameron Phase 2, as Jeff mentioned, the selection of Bechtel is a major milestone. And what we're doing with Bechtel is similar to what we did at Port Arthur. We, and our Cameron partners, will continue to conduct value engineering work through the fall as we finalize the EPC arrangements. And again, you have to remember that the goal is to optimize the design so we can optimize the overall cost structure and timing of COD. These efforts should position us for an FID next year, subject to definitive commercial arrangements and any needed regulatory extensions. So as you think about that timing, we're going to press forward on the EPC arrangements.  And we -- I guess I would echo what Jeff said, we were in this position last year on Port Arthur 1, and we'll try to do the same thing. Looking at Port Arthur Phase 2, very optimistic. We continue to advance commercial discussions with potential customers. Importantly, many of whom are also interested in project equity.  And at the same time, we're advancing engineering construction with Bechtel, regulatory and financing. Julien, as I kind of think about the business and where we are today, I think the key takeaway is we have made significant progress on our LNG strategy and are very bullish on both Port Arthur Phase 2 and Cameron Phase 2 moving forward next year. Jeffrey Martin : And then I would just conclude, Julien, by saying that we're going to finalize costs around Cameron expansion. We're going to complete the commercial arrangements and continue to progress our permits and look to take FID next year on Cameron.  The most important thing I'd always remind folks is, it's never really a race. It's about putting all the risk in a box and optimizing the project to produce the best returns for our investors. And we've demonstrated the ability to do that. And we've got a great team on it. So we feel good about our progress on both Port Arthur Phase 2 and Cameron expansion. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And just in light of those last comments, if you don't mind elaborating, Jeff, you used the term leapfrogging. I heard you the last time talking about it. I'm hearing you this time talking about it. So you feel pretty good about getting -- just the time line here, you're closer than not on announcing incremental commercial terms here, if you will, as just on PA2. And then also the inflationary dynamics. Do you feel confident about the terms there to derisk that project, the second phase as well? Jeffrey Martin : No, I would just clarify that I was reminding ourselves that when we had this call last year, there was still a fair amount of uncertainty around both projects, and we indicated there might be an opportunity for Port Arthur Phase 1 to leapfrog forward. What I'm really referring to is, even though there seems like there's a little bit of uncertainty around both of these brownfield projects, I can assure you that both of them are progressing in advance of what we've said publicly.  So we feel very good about both of them going forward, just like we were able to mature Port Arthur Phase 1. We're going to work diligently on Cameron expansion and Port Arthur Phase 2 with the hope of doing the same thing on both of those projects. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And you said still anticipated to sell down the equity potentially in future expansion. Just considering the backdrop of LNG transactions of late, I figured you just clarify that last comment, too. Jeffrey Martin : No. I mean this goes back to kind of how we tend to finance things. I mean, obviously, as we've talked about before several times, Julien, we're going to maximize our operating cash flows. We've got a lot of flexibility in our overall capital structure to finance things. But you see us at a 50% ownership level in Cameron today. You've seen us now at a 28% ownership position for Sempra Infrastructure Partners in Port Arthur Phase 1. But one of the unique things is we have the opportunity to optimize the capital structure so that we really improve the returns for our shareholders. So certainly, I think that's a pattern or practice you would expect us to continue. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to pick up after what Julien was putting down there with regards to Port Arthur 2. More specifically, on the FERC and the lack of the boat there for the expansion, any current sense on timing on your end? And do you see this kind of impacting commercial discussion? Jeffrey Martin : No, we don't. We do think it's important for that FERC certificate to be issued. We certainly think that will be issued in the next month or 2. So we remain optimistic about that. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful there. And then maybe drawing a bit more of a fine point, as a follow-up, we've seen Cove Point transacted at a much lower multiple than it did in 2019. And just wondering if this is a sign of value of the LNG space changing? Or just any thoughts on the value of that transaction? Jeffrey Martin : Look, I think at Cove Point, what you saw take place was the transaction from minority interest. It was not a transaction related to a controlling interest. I think the thing I would fall back on, Jeremy, is when you look at what's taking place in the LNG marketplace today, in the world, has a global capacity of just below 400 million tonnes per annum. That marketplace will grow by more than 50% by the end of the decade and likely double by the middle of the century. So the way we think about it is there is a need today for more LNG. That need will grow as countries around the world look for natural gas to balance out their commitment to cleaner fuels like renewables. We think the United States continues to have a competitive advantage, and we'll take market share. We are the world leader today in 2023. And when you think about the competitive price of natural gas in the United States, you think about the depth of our capital markets and the constructive regulation. This is less about Cove Point or NextDecade or Sempra. This is about the United States taking a leadership position in the world. We think this business will continue to get much bigger. It's grown at about an 8% CAGR from '17 to 2021, and we continue to expect to see strong growth in LNG marketplace. And I think Sempra is well positioned as any company in North America to be a big part of it. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. And wondering if there's any more commentary you're able to provide as far as commercial discussions or concerns between Asian versus European buyers or portfolio buyers otherwise? Just trying to get a flavor for kind of how that is progressing at this point? Jeffrey Martin : We're having commercial negotiations on Port Arthur Phase 2 as well as on some of the offtake arrangements around Cameron expansion. Many of the same type of customers you would expect in Europe and in Asia are part of those conversations. It is a very vibrant market today, and there's lots of conversations taking place by our marketing team. So we remain optimistic about future announcements in that area. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Real quick last one, if I could. Just wondering if you could provide more details on this latest Port Arthur CCS announcement. Is this project just CCS for Arthur and in Sempra? Or I guess, how -- what's the addressable market that you're targeting there? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. I would say that we've named this project Titan. It's some recent port space that we've been able to acquire. It is a very competitive process in Louisiana and Texas to have these types of facilities. And Titan has been dedicated to serve the needs of Port Arthur Phase 1 and future phases at Port Arthur. We also expect that it will serve other third-party interest in the region. Operator : Our next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Just wanted to go back to Texas very quickly. You had mentioned the Resiliency Bill. Could you just give us some details from a timing perspective in terms of when you're able to file for that? And kind of how long the approval process is expected to take until you can begin to recover investments under it? Jeffrey Martin : Sure. It's a really good question. And I will tell you, it is a very, very important development in Texas. We think it will be something that we will participate in once the rulemaking is set. But Allen, perhaps you could talk about the bill itself, when you think the rulemaking will be over and when you expect you'll put your first 3-year filing in front of the Commission. Allen Nye : Yes. You bet, Jeff. Let me -- I'll just run you through kind of the time line that we're seeing for HB 2555, the Resiliency Bill. The bill became effective June 13 of this year. It required a rulemaking to be completed within 180 days. So the statutory deadline for the rule is December 10 of this year, subject to whatever comes out of that rulemaking. Presumably, utilities like us would be free to file thereafter. The plans that are filed with the Commission by law are required to be approved, modified or rejected within 180 days. So with respect to us, we're hoping to file a plan in Q1 of 2024 and seek to have that plan approved in the second half of '24. That's what we know for now. Carly Davenport : Great. That's really helpful. And then just to think about the -- maybe shifting to California, just you mentioned the general rate cases kind of going on there. Can you just talk about kind of how that process has [indiscernible] so far, if there's initial , and if there's anything that surprised you so far? Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll pass it to Kevin if he wants to add anything. But the GRC hearings concluded in July and opening briefs will be filed in the middle of this month, with the proposed decisions I indicated in the second quarter of 2024. I think the most important thing, Carly, is the state is very focused on safety, reliability and decarbonization, and that's exactly how we lined up our rate cases. So remember, we had the first ramp rate case back in 2019. This is also a ramp format that we're following, and it's really closely aligned with what we think are the public policy positions of the state. So I think we're in good shape. Kevin, would you like to add anything else about how this unfolds? Kevin Sagara : I mean just process-wise, Carly, I just would mention that we also just updated our filings for inputs from inflation factors, labor rates, medical insurance costs and the like. So we just updated them. We're going to have a refile this fall and look forward for a PD in the first part of -- mid-next year, first part of the year. Operator : Our next question will come from Nicholas Campanella from Barclays. Nicholas Campanella : I'll keep it short. So I guess, Port Arthur, good to see you finalize 28% here. Just what's causing you to fall higher in the range that you kind of gave to us? And then when we think about the puts and takes around the funding plan and what was outlined in the first quarter call, now that you've kind of solidified this 28%, should we still think about no kind of external equity financing at the holdco? Jeffrey Martin : Sure. I would just say that we had originally targeted between 20% and 30% ownership. Obviously, our goal is to own as much of the project as we can. So we are very pleased to guide up to the 28% range. Previously, on calls, we had talked about notionally just giving out information at the 25% level. But our goal all along was to make sure that we could land as high in the range as possible. I think we're well set on financing. I'll pass it over to Faisel Khan, who's the CFO of Sempra Infrastructure, and maybe you can just update us on how he expects the Denali capital process to go forward and your funding for Port Arthur Phase 1. Faisel Khan : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. So as is always talked about, we have this sort of flexible capital structure. So first, with our project financing at Port Arthur, sort of well underway. That's roughly $7 billion in capital for the project. Then of course, we have our partners, ConocoPhillips and now KKR as equity partners as well.  And then we also have moving up the capital structure, you get into Sempra Infrastructure Partners, where you have ADIA and KKR as well. So again, plenty of capital to be drawn on from all of our partners sort of having that capital -- flexible capital structure in place enables us to sort of maximize returns for the project up to Sempra. Nicholas Campanella : Got it. And then I know everyone is very focused on Train 4 for Cameron. But can you just give us a sense of how debottlenecking for 1 through 3 is progressing? And whether you remain on track to increase that capacity before Train 4? Jeffrey Martin : Sure. Justin, you can take that. Justin Bird : Yes. Yes, Nick, we're still doing some of that engineering work. I'd say it's very positive. And as -- just as you recall, the debottlenecking won't be binary. So what we'll likely do, as we continue to take trains down for routine maintenance, we will do the debottlenecking activities during those trains, and we'll expect to see additional volumes. So again, debottlenecking is moving forward very positively. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Steven Fleishman : I just wanted to circle back to the -- back to Oncor and some of the things you mentioned, that $70 million, $90 million on DCRF and the kind of sensitivity on investment. So when would you see this benefit of DCRF? Would that be pretty much in place for 2024? Or -- yes. Jeffrey Martin : Yes, it's a good question. We expect to make our second DCRF filing for this year in September. And the pickup for DCRF, which might be a little bit this year, will primarily be in 2024. So it will be a full run rate benefit in 2024, Steve. Steven Fleishman : Okay. But you said it falls within your guidance because your guidance range is pretty wide, I guess. Jeffrey Martin : That's correct. But we'll also -- we also review that with our Board in the ordinary course as part of our fall financing exercise. And you'll recall, we'll also be updating and issuing our 2025 guidance on the February call. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And tied in with that, just on the capital at Oncor, which you said you'll update in the fall. The -- I mean will that include -- are you going to just update kind of normal course there? Or will that include this reliability aspect as well, which won't have been fully finalized by them? Or would that maybe come later on? Jeffrey Martin : Yes. I think this goes back to Carly's question. We're going to do our normal roll-forward 5-year planning process, led by Don Clevenger at Oncor. the Oncor Board will be deeply involved with that as well the ownership both of TTI and Sempra. We obviously have seen the capital plan grow from $15 billion to $19 billion just year-over-year, and we certainly think it's going to obviously grow again, as we've already indicated.  The key issue for you on this new rulemaking, which Allen indicated, the rulemaking, Steve, will not be finalized until, at the earliest, December 10 of this year. And Allen will be coming back to the Board with an add-on related to resiliency. So the work that we're doing that will be finalized in the fall is the normal roll-forward 5-year capital plan.  But once we have the rulemaking in place, Allen and his team will hustle to put together the appropriate analysis for the Oncor Board, and that will lead to the filing that we made with the Commission. And I think, as Allen indicated, we expect to have feedback from the Commission in the second half of the year. Allen, do you want add to that? Allen Nye : No, Jeff. I think that's exactly right. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks. Jeffrey Martin : Look, as we close out today's call, I wanted to note that we're pleased with our financial results, both for the quarter and for the first half of the year. I certainly believe we continue to make great progress on our LNG story, and we're making progress at Phase 2 at both Cameron and Port Arthur and are also pleased to guide to the higher ownership percentage of 28% at Port Arthur Phase 1. And as you can tell from today's call, Texas continues to be one of the leading growth stories in the country. And the improved regulatory compact there is a very strong signal, in my opinion, for continued investment. And finally, as we celebrate our 25th anniversary, we're pleased to announce our 2-for-1 stock split.  We appreciate everyone making time to join us this morning. We have several IR events this month in Wisconsin and Las Vegas and hope to see many of you there. This concludes our call, and feel free to follow up with our IR team. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra's third quarter 2023 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Please note that all share per share amounts reflect the 2-for-1 split of our common stock in the form of 100% stock dividend that we announced on the second quarter call and distributed in August. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, November 3, 2023, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased with the strength of our third quarter results, which sets the stage for our Company's continued growth. Given current geopolitical tensions, countries around the world are looking to ensure they are not dependent on supply chains that are subject to disruption and uncertainty. Increasingly, they want to source essential goods, whether food, liquefied natural gas, or microchips closer to home or from dependable allies. With this trend toward deglobalization, we see North America as one of the principal beneficiaries. We also believe these trends support important new growth in Mexico, where in the first half of 2023, foreign direct investment has risen sharply by approximately 40% over the prior year comparable period. Just this year, Mexico has also surpassed China as America's largest trading partner. As these trends continue, new higher levels of investment in North America's energy grid will be critical to supporting continued economic expansion. That's why at Sempra, we're really excited about our mission to build this continent's premier energy infrastructure company. As part of that mission, we focus significant time and effort on building a high-performing culture where we invest for the long-term in our business and our employees. And in combination, this has helped us achieve strong financial and operating results. Our strategy focuses on what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America with strong economic growth and constructive regulation. Combined with capital discipline, this positions Sempra to deliver competitive long-term returns for our owners. Also, our business is expected to benefit from secular tailwinds that support our five-year capital plan of approximately $40 billion. You will recall I've spoken before about the opportunities that lie ahead for Oncor and the possibility of doubling their rate base over the next five to six years. While we're still early in our fall planning process, we expect to increase our $40 billion capital plan by 10% to 20% when we update our five-year plan on our fourth quarter call. This increase is expected to be anchored by regulated utility investments and primarily driven by Oncor. Overall, we continue to see significant growth in multiple areas of Oncor service territory. And with Allen here today, he will speak to some of those opportunities later on today's call. Turning to the quarter, we believe our results demonstrate the strength of our business and our ability to continue producing strong earnings growth. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 and year-to-date 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $3.48. Given our year-to-date success, we're expecting to be at or above the high end of our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range and we're affirming our 2024 EPS guidance range and projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. Finally, let me take a moment to speak about Kevin Sagara, who will be retiring next month after nearly 30 years of service at Sempra and its predecessor companies. Kevin was instrumental in the 1998 transaction that originally formed Sempra when the parent companies of SDG&E and SoCalGas merged. He has held many leadership positions across our companies, including CEO of Sempra Renewables, CEO of San Diego Gas & Electric, as well as his recent role as Group President over our California Utilities. He's had a really amazing career here and made significant contributions to our success and will be greatly missed. Now let me turn the call over to Allen Nye, who will take us through business developments in Texas. Allen Nye : Thank you, Jeff. Today I would like to highlight our strong operational performance this quarter and speak to the recent legislation that we believe will improve our ability to provide high quality service to customers and deliver improved financial performance. I'll then finish by highlighting some of the underlying growth drivers at Oncor. Despite record heat throughout the third quarter, the Oncor team performed exceptionally well, and I would like to thank them for working safely in extremely difficult conditions. As a result of our team's efforts, reliability continued to be strong, with average outage duration improving by 9% over the last 12 months. Turning to the continuation of the Texas Miracle, Oncor is one of the nation's largest pure play T&D utilities, operating in one of the fastest growing states. With over 30 million people, Texas\u2019 GDP is approximately $2 trillion, which makes it the eighth largest economy in the world. Texas annual GDP grew at 3.4% last year, well above the U.S. average of 2.1%. Our pro-business climate is well documented and has driven diversified job creation across many sectors of the economy. Oncor serves four of the top 15 fastest growing cities in America, with premise growth of approximately 2% annually expected in our service territory. The population of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is larger than most states, and in each of the last two years added more people than any other U.S. metropolitan area. This growth has certainly impacted the demand for electricity. This past summer, ten peak demand records were set in the ERCOT region, culminating in an 85 gigawatt peak, which is 16% higher than the peak just five years ago. This growth also continues to fuel significant expansion of our system. In the third quarter, Oncor connected around 20,000 additional premises, built, rebuilt or upgraded approximately 630 miles of T&D lines, and managed 755 active transmission interconnection requests, a 34% increase over last year. Specifically, retail interconnection requests have increased about 90% since the end of Q3 last year, which will be a major driver in our capital budget. Turning to the recently completed Texas legislative session, several bills were passed that give utilities better tools to support the growth of the state and improve resiliency of the grid. As we discussed on the second quarter call, HB 2555 provides a new opportunity for Oncor to develop a forward-looking plan to invest in the resiliency of our system. The PUCT rulemaking associated with this legislation is currently underway, and we expect it to be finalized in the fourth quarter of this year. We are targeting the first quarter of 2024 to file our first system resiliency plan, or SRP, with the Public Utility Commission. HB 2555 provides for a six-month timeline for review and approval of the SRP. While much work remains to implement this legislation, we are optimistic that it will provide needed hardening, modernization and risk mitigation to our T&D grid for the benefit of our customers, while improving the earnings and cash flow needed to support these investments in the future. Additionally, you'll remember Oncor is now also able to file two distribution cost trackers each year, as opposed to just one. Thanks to SB 1015. In September, Oncor submitted its second DCRF tracker for investments made in the first half of the year. SB 1015 accelerated DCRF approval timelines to 60 to 75 days, matching the efficient interim TCOS process that has worked well for two decades. As we said last quarter, we expect the addition of the second DCRF filing to improve Oncor\u2019s earnings by approximately $70 million to $90 million annually. Oncor is actively evaluating our five-year capital plan to reflect the continued growth across Oncor service territory and the impacts of new legislation. After reviewing with our board, we expect to announce an update as part of Sempra\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. Please turn to the next slide. This slide demonstrates the diversity of our service territory, both geographically and by customer type, which propels Oncor\u2019s expected higher capital plan. As you can see, growth is driven by a broad group of industries, including manufacturing, oil and gas, professional services and large data centers arising not only in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex but in North, Central and West Texas. Notably, the Permian Basin continues to be one of the premier energy producing regions in the world and is undergoing a major electrification effort. The load demand in this region is projected to increase from 4.2 gigawatts to roughly 17.2 gigawatts over the next decade. Please turn to the next slide, while I will hand the call to Trevor to review business updates at Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure as well as Sempra's detailed financial results. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Allen. Starting in California, it's worth reminding everyone that during the third quarter, Southern California experienced a rare tropical storm and I\u2019m pleased to say that both SDG&E and SoCalGas Systems remained resilient and operational. We believe delivering energy under these circumstances validates the important work our teams have accomplished in continuing to improve system safety and reliability. Over the past several decades, PA Consulting has published reliability rankings for American Utilities, and SDG&E was recently awarded the number one ranking of best in the West for the 18th year in a row. They also received the National Grid Sustainability Award. This award is presented to a leading American utility, demonstrating excellence and reliable service to its customers, including the application of clean energy technology and investment in the grid. In combination, these awards are a great credit to Caroline Winn and the entire SDG&E team. One key consideration in supporting the energy transition is the ability to store and discharge excess power. With more renewable energy, storage and dispatchable resources are critical for maintaining the stability of the grid even during extreme weather events. That's why, in the third quarter, SDG&E requested approval for another 160 megawatts of utility-owned energy storage assets. This is in addition to the 171 megawatts of recently commissioned assets that we discussed on our second quarter call. If approved, this would bring SDG&E's energy storage portfolio to over 500 megawatts in support of their ability to deliver safer, cleaner and more reliable energy to its customers. Importantly, as SDG&E integrates innovative technologies, such as utility-owned storage to help meet its good reliability and clean energy goals, we're also pursuing federal investment tax credits, which could result in an estimated $215 million in savings. The potential savings would be passed on to customers and included in the calculation to establish rates beginning in January 2025 as part of the company's continued efforts to drive a series of cost savings initiatives to improve the affordability of its services. Last quarter, we updated you on the approval of Cal ISO's transmission plan and the recent assignment to us of $500 million of new projects in our service territory. Also, SDG&E submitted bid materials for Cal ISO's FERC 1000 solicitation, and we expect to be quite competitive as part of that process. As you know, transmission assets deliver benefits integrating increasing amounts of clean energy to the broader state of California, and as such, these costs are spread across the state. Recently, the CPUC approved an increase in the authorized working gas storage capacity at Aliso Canyon. The CPUC recognized the importance of the facility to help improve grid reliability and customer affordability. The additional gas storage capacity is also expected to help mitigate potential price volatility. Additionally, in the third quarter, Governor Newsom directed the formation of California's hydrogen market development strategy, which will employ an all of government approach to lay out pathways for building a robust hydrogen market in the state. We're excited to see the innovative ways that hydrogen may be used to help decarbonize California's economy. On the federal side, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded up to $1.2 billion of funding for our regional clean hydrogen hub in California. SoCalGas is proud to be a partner in ARCHES, the statewide public private partnership sponsoring this application. The DOE\u2019s Award demonstrates support for the valuable role hydrogen could play in decarbonization while striving to ensure safety, affordability and resiliency. California recently passed into law SB 410, supporting investments for further decarbonization and electrification of the energy system. As electrification continues to become a larger part of the state\u2019s strategy to achieve its climate goals, demand on the electric grid will also increase, meaning utilities will need to proactively plan and build distribution grid upgrades to meet customer needs. Similar to some of the Texas legislative updates that Allen described, SB 410 is California\u2019s recognition of the need to utilize existing regulatory mechanisms, such as balancing accounts to support customer needs in between GRC cycles and help California\u2019s utility make critical new investments to keep pace with the state\u2019s expanding economy and decarbonization goals. I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on the GRC process. Our applications are centered around safety, reliability, and the delivery of increasingly clean forms of energy. We recently filed a few settlement agreements with various interveners, including Cal Advocates, small business utility advocates, TURN and UCAN. While there remains input from other interveners and ultimately approval by the CPUC as part of the final decision in the GRC, we believe this is a constructive step in the process. We continue to expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with rates retroactive to the beginning of that year. As a final note, most of you already are aware that the cost of capital mechanism triggered, and both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed advice letters, which are pending commission approval. These applications are expected to increase ROEs by approximately 70 basis points beginning January 1, 2024. We believe this adjustment should be approved by the commission as part of the established mechanism and is one of the key components that supports California\u2019s constructive regulatory environment. We believe California\u2019s regulatory framework is quite constructive relative to other jurisdictions given its forward-looking rates, attractive ROEs, cost of capital adjustment mechanism, and advanced framework for handling climate related event risks. With California\u2019s continued economic growth and constructive regulatory framework, we believe our utilities are well-positioned to continue improving their service to customers while supporting overall system growth and resiliency. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to Sempra Infrastructure. We\u2019ve reached several key milestones in the quarter. At Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, we completed the previously announced sale of a 42% indirect non-controlling interest in the project KKR and recently, Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 received a permit from FERC, a critical milestone in the project\u2019s development. Now that FERC has issued its approval, the DOE is able to consider the environmental review associated with our non-FDA application. Marketing of Phase 2\u2019s off-take continues to build momentum as we see volumes coalesce in the market around projects that have the highest potential of commercial development. Phase 2 is also expected to add two additional liquefaction trains capable of producing an incremental 13 Mtpa, which would effectively double the total capacity of Port Arthur. In its entirety, the Port Arthur energy hub showcases the expertise and value that Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s integrated capabilities bring to project development. Earlier this year, in March, Cameron LNG Phase 2 received approval for its FERC order. Sempra Infrastructure and its partners at Cameron LNG continue to develop a fourth liquefaction train. We have now begun working with Bechtel to perform value engineering to reduce construction risks and project costs. We expect this process will continue through the end of the year. Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s mission is to provide energy for a better world through its high growth, low carbon platform. We\u2019re excited about collaborating with Mitsubishi Corporation and a consortium of Japanese natural gas utility companies to explore the development and export of e-natural gas, which is synthesized from captured CO2 by combining it with green hydrogen. Together, the stakeholders intend to evaluate a Gulf Coast project with a view towards producing approximately 130,000 tons of e-natural gas annually that would be liquefied and exported from the Cameron LNG terminal. Wrapping up on Sempra Infrastructure. The overall scale of our portfolio positions us to capture additional growth opportunities, create new synergies, and support the growth of top tier projects, as demonstrated by the Port Arthur Energy Hub, currently under construction and development. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we believe North America's energy markets will continue to be driven by the trends of decarbonization, energy security and reshoring of manufacturing back to North America. Sempra Infrastructure remains well positioned to contribute to and capitalize on such opportunities. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to our financial results, earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $721 million or $1.14 per share. This compares to third quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $485 million or $0.77 per share. On an adjusted basis, third quarter 2023 earnings were $685 million, or $1.08 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2022 earnings of $622 million, or $0.98 per share. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the third quarter 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following. At Sempra California, $27 million of lower income tax benefits and higher net interest expense offset by $27 million of higher electric transmission and CPUC base operating margin at SDG&E, net of lower authorized cost of capital and higher regulatory interest income at SDG&E and SoCalGas. At Sempra Texas, $49 million of higher equity earnings from weather driven consumption, new base rates and customer growth. At Sempra Infrastructure, $21 million of lower net interest expense due to higher capitalization of interest on projects under construction, $16 million, primarily driven from higher transportation tariffs. At Sempra Parent, there were $23 million of higher costs, primarily driven by increased interest expense, partially offset by a net income tax benefit. Given the geographic and regulatory overlays between the two companies, we are currently considering resegmentation in which our SDG&E and SoCalGas segments would be combined into one reportable segment, Sempra California. We intend to complete our analysis in the fourth quarter of 2023 and assuming a positive determination is made, we would implement the resegmentation in our annual 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2023. Please turn to the next slide. We are pleased with the strength of our third quarter results and the positive message it conveys about Sempra's business quality and the robust growth we are seeing across all three platforms. Before I close, let me briefly touch base on the balance sheet. Debt is a core component of our capital structure, and over the past three years, we've taken important steps to transition to lower rate, longer duration, fixed rate debt. We have been prudent with our balance sheet management by using proceeds from the non-controlling interest sales to KKR in 2021 and ADIA in 2022 to repay short-term debt and limit near-term parent debt maturities. In fact, at the parent level, if interest rates increase by another 50 basis points, we would project a negligible impact to EPS between now and 2027. Please refer to Slide 14 in the appendix for additional information. Looking forward, we remain focused on identifying and executing on sound capital investment opportunities. We are continuing to optimize our financing plan to support the growth we highlighted today and will evaluate all of our financing options, including the use of common equity to support accretive growth. Throughout our history, Sempra has demonstrated operational excellence, strong financial stewardship, meaningful earnings growth, and a commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We would now like to open the line up and take some of your questions. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now open the line to take your questions. We have time today to take several of your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Hey guys. Jeff Martin : Hey, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, Jeff. I know Trevor just kind of answered the question a little bit here. But on the 10% to 20% CapEx, I mean, that\u2019s obviously significant financing needs that will come with that. And you guys have different levers, right? You\u2019ve been able to kind of minimize that external equity. You\u2019ve recapitalized at SIP. You\u2019ve had obviously some unlocking of debt capacity. I guess, I\u2019m just kind of curious on, can you just elaborate on just Trevor\u2019s comments a little bit around the source of funding this 10% to 20%? Does it need to come from straight equity or can you utilize what you\u2019ve utilized in the past? Thanks. Jeff Martin : Yes. Thank you for the question, Shar. And look, I think we would look to all those levers, but Trevor, since you spoke about this in the prepared remarks, why don\u2019t you provide some additional color please? Trevor Mihalik : Yes. Sure, Shar. Again \u2013 how you doing, Shar? We\u2019re pretty excited about the investment opportunities and that\u2019s really kind of what we had mentioned on this call. And that\u2019s really kind of coming from the regulated utilities and that\u2019s really around continuing to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers. So that 10% to 20% increase over the five year capital plan, we will discuss in more detail on the year end call. But we do understand just how important the financing is on this. So we\u2019re continuing to analyze the expected capital needs and we are currently looking at efficient ways to finance this growth. And as we always have, as Jeff said, we will look at all of the options, but we will include common equity as part of that consideration. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Thanks for that, Trevor. And obviously depreciate sort of that early update around the CapEx plan. Obviously, you\u2019re highlighting that 10% to 20% is purely on the regulated side, which is good. It is a bit of a wide range. So I guess, what could dictate 10% versus 20% since it\u2019s already kind of skewed what you already know, which is Texas and California. And the CapEx update would predate the California GRC final order. So is that also a potential tailwind or is that captured on that 10% to 20%? Thanks, guys. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Shar. The way I would think about it is, we just had \u2013 Trevor and I just had our Oncor Board meeting just two weeks ago. They\u2019re going through their planning process. And what\u2019s different this year relative to prior years is we\u2019ve aligned our financial planning process here at Sempra with the work that Allen and Don do in Dallas. And as we\u2019ve been going through that process, we\u2019ll make some final decisions with the Oncor Board later this year and look to kind of report kind of a comprehensive view on our capital in February. The good news is we\u2019ve seen enough direction about where the capital plan is going to provide that 10% to 20% guidance. So, look, I was thinking about this before. If you go all the way back to the early 2018 time frame, we had roughly a $14 billion five year capital plan. And right now we\u2019re executing on one that\u2019s close to $40 billion. And we\u2019re expecting that to go up quite significantly between now and February. So we\u2019ve been on a pretty big growth campaign over the last three to five years, and we\u2019re pleased that it\u2019s continued. What we can guide you to is it will be anchored to utility investments and specifically led by Texas. Shar Pourreza : Just lastly for me, Jeff. Appreciate it. I have to ask this IP question. Jeff Martin : Sure. Shar Pourreza : Just, I guess, can you just talk about the impacts of that development pipeline? The fuel terminal moved from 4Q to the first half of 2024, Port Arthur, pipes and storage expansion are moving into the construction phase. ECA Regas contract is expiring, which would allow for ECA 2 in the mix. Are these developments, just so we understand, are they net accretive to that 6% to 8% growth rate you talk about? Thanks. Jeff Martin : Yes. I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and I\u2019ll pass it to Justin. I would start by saying that we\u2019re at this point in the planning process where we\u2019re not going to go into details about what\u2019s in the plan or outside the plan. What\u2019s more important to us is our LNG strategy, which you\u2019re referring to is moving forward briskly, primarily because as compared to our peers, we have the opportunity to both dispatch LNG directly into the Pacific and out of the Gulf. I would update you, Shar, that Cameron Phase 1 is producing in excess of 100% of its expected volumes. Both ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur Phase 1 are in construction and moving forward on schedule with a great safety record. And I think what might be helpful to your question is for Justin. Maybe do two things, Justin, if you would, talk about the development status of Cameron LNG Phase 2, Port Arthur Phase 2, and then speak directly, if you don\u2019t mind, both to the Louisiana connector as well as the storage facility. Justin Bird : Great. Thanks, Jeff. Hi, Shar. We\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re seeing at SI across our development projects. As Jeff mentioned at Port Arthur Phase 2, we recently received our FERC approval we think this is a major milestone that adds to the commercial momentum that we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re continuing to advance commercial discussions with potential customers, again many of whom are also interested in project equity. And at the same time, we\u2019re advancing engineering and construction, regulatory and financing. At Cameron Phase 2, we\u2019re working with Bechtel on value engineering. And similar to what we did at Port Arthur, we and our partners are continuing to conduct that exercise and expect that work to go through the end of the year. The goal is to optimize the design and reduce the construction cost and project risk. As we previously mentioned, these efforts should position us well to make a final investment decision in 2024, subject to definitive commercial arrangements, project financing, and any needed regulatory extensions. On the PA pipeline and the LA storage that you talked about, look, you recall in the last call we talked about the value of the Port Arthur energy hub. Both Port Arthur pipeline and LA storage are key components of that facility and really support the operations of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, Port Arthur pipeline, I sometimes call it the Louisiana Connector, has access to the liquid supply hub at Gillis and has the capacity to deliver slightly over 2 Bcf a day of gas to Port Arthur Phase 1. LA storage is 12.5Bcf. It\u2019s a high turn salt dome storage facility, and it also supports the gas supply strategy for Port Arthur Phase 1, and importantly, future phases. Both Port Arthur pipeline and LA Storage have begun the procurement and engineering process and importantly, we anticipate both to be online in advance of Port Arthur Phase 1. I think the key takeaway is that we continue to make significant progress at SI on our LNG strategy and the associated development, and we\u2019re bullish on both Brownfield projects progressing in the next year. It\u2019s an exciting time to be in the LNG space and that we think our projects are well positioned to support our customers. Shar Pourreza : Thank you, Justin. Justin Bird : Thank you, Shar. Shar Pourreza : A couple days. Bye. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question will come from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jeff Martin : Hi, Carly. Carly Davenport : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, just as you think about the drivers for potential CapEx upside you mentioned, I think at Encore, new retail connections, being a key driver there, are there any other factors that you\u2019d point to as big contributors to that potential upside on the capital spend? Jeff Martin : I think, one of the most important things we\u2019re tracking right now, Carly, is making sure that we have a successful execution of our general rate case here in California that continues to go well. We\u2019ve got a track record of working well with all stakeholders to get to good outcomes for our rate payers. So that\u2019s one that we\u2019re following. We\u2019ve obviously got several things that Justin just went over in terms of development opportunities related to Port Arthur Phase 2 and Cameron Phase 2, both of those are significant opportunities for our company. And I think Justin and his team have a fair amount of momentum on both of those projects. And what might be helpful to you is to give a little bit color about some of the drivers, specifically in Texas, having spent more time out there. It is really quite remarkable. I\u2019ve been in the business for almost three decades, and it\u2019s quite remarkable the type of growth and how diversified the growth is in Texas. And maybe if we could, Allen, if you could provide a little bit more color about where some of the growth is coming from and why it\u2019s impacting your capital plan so strongly. Allen Nye : Yes, you bet, Jeff. Thank you. And thanks for the question, Carly. As Jeff said, our growth in Encore continues to be just very strong across the board. And I know I mentioned some of this in my opening remarks as well as in our press release, but just for example, premise growth for this quarter versus last quarter or versus same quarter last year up 43%. Total transmission points of interconnection are up 34% versus the same quarter last year. New requests for transmission points of interconnection are up 34%. Retail points of interconnection totals are up 28%. Generation points of interconnection up 38%. So really strong premise growth. Really strong growth on our transmission system for transmission POIs. And then, as I alluded to earlier in my remarks, West Texas continues to perform very, very well. Far West Texas weather zone peak increase of 16.6% over the 2022 peak. And then really strong growth on both our Culberson loop and our Stanton loop, with Culberson up 16.5% and Stanton up over 23% \u2013 about 23.5%. Really strong developments in our economic development area. New projects up 21%, RFIs up 21%. So really just strong growth everywhere across our system, as I think is shown on Slide 6 of the deck. The real diversity of our growth, not only from an industry perspective, but from a geographic perspective as well. And that growth is what has been a consistent driver for our CapEx plan ever since we announced the $7.5 billion over five-year regulatory commitment, when we announced a simpler transaction all the way through till where we are now at 19.2 [ph] over five. And we expect that trend to continue as we work with our Board. We met in October, began discussing with our Board our CapEx plan, our five-year plan, and what we need for next year. As Jeff said, we're going to announce that on the fourth quarter call with the other Sempra companies. But we expect that it will be a significant increase if we continue to see what we're seeing right now on our system. And we also expect there'll be some additional opportunities related to House Bill 2555, the resiliency bill. So we feel very good about where we are with our CapEx plan right now going into these additional meetings with our Board and we'll be announcing later. Lastly, I just have to say, and I know I said it earlier, but we're really pleased that we've been able to navigate this really exceptional period of growth while maintaining our operational excellence. And I think the example of that is the fact that our customers are seeing seven fewer minutes of outages than they did in the prior year, an improvement of about 9%. And also our employees have been doing an excellent job of staying safe. So all credit to them. But, Jeff, that's kind of where we are in those issues. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Allen. Carly Davenport : Great. Thanks, Allen. Thanks, Jeff, for that color. Great to hear. And then the follow-up was just around the CCM trigger. Could you just remind us kind of the next steps in that process? And then as you think about your earnings expectations for next year, do you embed that 70 basis point improvement in ROE or could there be potential upside there? Jeff Martin : Thank you for the question, Carly. I know that PG&E spoke to this on their call last week and Edison spoke to it earlier this week. And the way we think about it is the cost of capital mechanism was put in place for situations in our view, when the capital markets move outside the deadband. And with the rising rates that we've all seen, that's what we've seen over the last year. Based on the methodology that's used in California, the cost of capital mechanism has triggered. And accordingly, Carly, we have filed our advice letters last month with the resulting change to rates. You may have seen yesterday, interveners filed their joint filing and we'll make our reply next week. But from our perspective, at the end of the day, we fully anticipate the commission will support the existing adjustment mechanism that's in place. And in terms of 2024 guidance, we reaffirmed that today. We've taken this question before and we've said that whether it goes forward or doesn't go forward, it's within the range that we published. Carly Davenport : Great. Appreciate that color. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Carly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Your line is open. Jeff Martin : Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yes, hey. Good afternoon. Good morning. So first, Kevin, congrats and also congrats to Allen on the Texas Rangers, wow. Allen Nye : Thank you. Steve Fleishman : Yes. So just wanted to follow up on the comment about the segmenting in California of the businesses. Is this just a resegmenting for accounting purposes? Are you considering even some type of structural merger of the entities? Jeff Martin : Steve, it's something we have under evaluation right now. And as you know, when you think about financial segments, you think about how Trevor and I view the business. And from an accounting perspective, we think this is something that might make sense in terms of how we manage the business across three growth platforms. But, Trevor, perhaps you can provide some additional color from Steve on where you're at with your analysis. Trevor Mihalik : I think, again, it is really kind of an accounting analysis. And really, as Jeff said, Steve, this is how we as the chief operating decision makers, will be evaluating the business on a combined basis. That being said, we will still be filing the Q's and K's for the individual businesses in our combined consolidated financial statements. So you'll still have access to that detailed information as well. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. My other questions were answered, so thank you. Jeff Martin : Thank you for joining us, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys for the time. Appreciate it. And Kevin, I got to echo the congrats again to you too, sir. Thank you for all the help over the years. Kevin Sagara : Thank you, Julian. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Best of luck here. Look, just to come back a little bit in the same direction of some of the prior questions on equity, how do you think about some of these more efficient alternatives here? I mean, certainly maybe minority settle downs have been part of the MO [ph] at various points here. But how do you think about the alternatives to common equity, given the track record of pursuing these kinds of alternative avenues in recent years for LNG, as you think about funding the utility growth? Jeff Martin : Yeah. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Did you sell down a portion of the utility? Jeff Martin : Sure. No, we're not selling down any portions of the utilities. No, most importantly, when you see this type of growth that's in front of our company, it goes back to kind of first principles at Sempra which is being a disciplined allocator of capital, and it's just as important to match that discipline with efficiently sourcing. And we've answered this a couple of different times, Trevor, but maybe you just provide some color on how you're thinking about again. Trevor Mihalik : Yes. Again, I think we've looked at various ways over the last several years to look at how to source the capital. But at the end of the day, I think from our perspective, I think we're looking at ways that would be the most efficient and the most timely. And right now, we're thinking that anytime you have this kind of growth, we will look at all sources of capital needs. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Indeed, I wish you the best of luck as you plan, and I anticipate we'll hear on fourth quarter on that front. If you may just to pivot in a slightly different direction; as you think about the quantum of CapEx and the potential step up here, how do you frame that against the regulatory lag expectations? Again, I get that you haven't settled on ten versus 20%, et cetera, but how would you think about lag prospectively, understanding some of the legislative impacts, amongst others, that could also play into the math about keeping up earned returns? Jeff Martin : Yes. Thank you, Jillian for that question. I would start by referring you to Slide 13 in our slide deck. And just historically, it gives you a sense of how much growth we've seen in our capital plan from 2017 to 2023. And it gives you a sense of the question you just asked, Trevor. We've been pretty thoughtful about how we source capital and how we allocate capital to growth. In terms of regulatory lag, I think there's a couple of key takeaways here for the audience. Number one, on our Q2 call and again today, we've talked about the quality of the regulatory compact in Texas. Several different bills that Allen walked through specifically reduced regulatory lag, which led to his improvement in terms of expectations of $70 million to $90 million of additional earnings. Likewise, SB 410 is passed in California, very similar to some of the initiatives in Texas. And this, again, allows for reduced lag between rate cases on some of these investments around electrification. So we're going to be very thoughtful about making sure that when we grow our rate base you're going to see earnings growth really track that rate base over time. So we've taken these things into consideration. We're midway through our financial planning process for the fall. We feel great about the direction things are going for the company. We have a lot of growth ahead of us. But anytime you see this level of growth, what Trevor and I are focused on is making sure that we're driving discipline throughout the organization in terms of how we allocate capital and how we source capital. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So, more consistent level, or actually, could you see improvement on earned returns? Jeff Martin : I think, our job is and we have multiple meetings about this we're trying to improve returns in all three of our growth businesses all the time. That's clearly right in our wheelhouse of the discussions of the management team. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you. Best of luck here, and I'll see you soon. Jeff Martin : All right, sounds good. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question, and our last question will come from Nicholas Campanella from Barclays. Your line is open. Jeff Martin : Hi, Nick. Nicholas Campanella : Hey. Thanks to squeeze me in. How's everyone doing? Hey, I just wanted to follow up on the segmentation for California. Just what's the ultimate goal? Is it just to simplify the structure from a reporting standpoint, or is there benefits that could be realized for customers and shareholders if you were to kind of pursue something from a regulatory standpoint? I just acknowledge that SoCalGas and SDG&E are pretty close on the filing paths and just wanted to take your temperature there. Jeff Martin : Sure. Now, obviously, this is something that we're still evaluating but remember, over the last three or four years, one of my priorities with our Board has been to simplify our business model. And I've talked about it a fair amount, Nick, that anytime you can simplify your business, take risk away from how you execute, you can make your business more valuable. So we've boiled this business down from to having really three primary growth platforms Sempra, Texas, Sempra California, and Sempra Infrastructure. And all we're really evaluating at this point is, would it make sense for us as key executive decision makers to make sure that our accounting reflects how we think about and manage the business? This is something we're going to evaluate over the next several months and come back to you guys on Q4. It's no major legal reorganization. It's not that at all. It's just a matter of does it not reflect a more simplified form of how we manage and operate the business. Nicholas Campanella : Okay, great. And then maybe I could just kind of come back to some of the questions on the growth rate. Quick, like I understand that cost of capital is, reflected in the range of outcomes here but you have a lot of positives that you just talked about in Texas \u2013 obviously, financing is a moving target, but should investors still just be expecting you to do the six to eight no matter what the scenario? Or do you see upward pressure to the growth rate? Jeff Martin : No, I appreciate that question, and we're always looking to put upward pressure on that growth rate. But the way we've always oriented is we don't think about a 6% to 8% growth rate as a year-over-year issue or necessarily even a five year planning issue over long periods of time. We're one of the few companies in our sector that have been able to deliver those type of results. So over a 20 year period of time, we've grown our earnings per share at a 7% CAGR in the last 10 years, we've grown it at an 8% CAGR in the last three or four years, we've grown it at rates much higher than that. So I think our orientation is you're talking about a sector that has traditionally grown EPS at 3% or 4%. We're very comfortable that over long periods of time that we can deliver a 6% to 8% growth rate. But I think you're on the right track. We're certainly talking about a unique set of growth drivers in front of the business today. So we as a management team would always be looking to see if we could not push and exceed those expectations, if possible. Nicholas Campanella : Hey, I appreciate it. And happy Friday. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Hey, I appreciate it, Nick. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Thank you. Before we close out the call, I wanted to thank everyone who took the time to join today. I know it's been a busy week with a lot of earnings calls. Here's a few key takeaways. Number one, we had a strong quarter of financial results with year to date results trending ahead of the comparable period in 2022, which you will recall was a record year for the company. As a result, we're guiding our adjusted EPS to at or above the high end of our guidance range. Number two, we're also seeing a portfolio of new opportunities, particularly in Texas, to deploy higher levels of investment and are expecting to raise our five year capital plan by 10% to 20%. I'd also want to mention that we'll be attending EEI next weekend in Phoenix and very much look forward to spending time with each of you in person at that time. Thank you again for joining. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Group President, Sempra California; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and other members of our senior management team. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. Earnings per common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Please note that all sharing per share amounts reflect the 2 :1 split of our common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend that we announced in the second quarter call and distributed in August. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, February 27, 2024, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 5 and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the last several months, we've spent time with investors and the research community, soliciting feedback on ways to make today's call more informative. In response to your feedback, we'll be providing more information today from more executives. I'll start off by summarizing our recent business accomplishments and our corporate strategy and will be followed by the leaders of each platforms, who will likewise summarize their accomplishments, business model and expected capital deployment. Karen will close out today's presentation with a review of our Q4 and full year financial results and outline our new 2024 to 2028 capital plan. We'll also be sure to save time at the end to take your questions. Now turning to 2023, it was a strong year of operating and financial performance for our Company, and in large measure is a credit to our corporate strategy and our success in simplifying our business model. At Sempra, we're focused on making disciplined investments in large and growing economic markets that are looking to modernize their energy networks and connect communities to safer, more reliable and cleaner energy. Over the last five years, this strategy has allowed us to build significant scale into our business for the benefit of customers and shareholders. As we previewed on our third quarter call in November, I'm excited to announce that our capital plan has increased by 20% to a new company record of $48 billion with more than 90% allocated to regulated transmission and distribution investments. Trevor, Allen and Justin will go into more detail later in today's presentation, but the overall scope and size of our capital plan really speaks to the robust markets we operate in and the magnitude of the growth opportunities that are in front of our company. Turning to our 2023 financial results, we delivered adjusted EPS of $4.61 exceeding the high-end of our guidance and providing support to narrow our full year 2024 EPS guidance range to $4.60 to $4.90. This morning, we're also announcing full year 2025 EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.25, which represents approximately 7% growth from the midpoint of the prior guidance range. Based upon the continued growth we're seeing across our three T&D growth platforms, we're affirming our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. Finally, we're also pleased to announce the Board of Directors approved increase in our dividend for the 14th consecutive year to $2.48 per share. Please turn to the next slide. For the past several years, the United States has experienced significant economic uncertainty due to higher inflation, supply chain disruptions and higher interest rates. Against this backdrop, Sempra delivered strong financial performance in 2023 with record adjusted earnings and record adjusted earnings per share. Also over the last several years, our investment strategy has consistently prioritized making investments in energy networks in California and Texas, and this has allowed us to grow our rate base in those markets at the end of 2023 to just over $50 billion. Looking forward, one of the primary benefits of rolling out an expanded capital plan is that it provides unique visibility to the strength of our long-term earnings growth. Also, it's important to note that our equity offering last November was successful in mitigating future equity needs associated with our new plan. On the regulatory front, we've made several advances highlighting the constructive nature of the jurisdictions where we operate and our ability to work effectively with key stakeholders. In California, the cost of capital mechanism triggered as a result, SDG&E and SoCalGas increased their authorized ROEs last month. We also reached a proposed settlement with certain interveners for a portion of our pending rate cases, which we view constructively. Turning to Texas, Oncor successfully completed its base rate review last spring. Also several important pieces of legislation were passed that support new investments in transmission and distribution that benefit customers and the continued growth of the state's economy. Also at Sempra Infrastructure, we declared positive FID on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, secured financing and began construction. We continue to make steady progress on our development projects. While the pause on non-FTE export permits has impacted the sector, we're confident in the commercial value of our projects and we'll continue to develop these critical infrastructure assets on a reasonable timeline. Justin will address this topic further in his section. Please turn to the next slide. Sempra is building critical new infrastructure designed to support economic and population growth while providing attractive financial returns to our owners. Through 2050, global GDP is expected to more than double, much of which will come from emerging economies, driving the need for incremental energy resources. Going forward, we strongly believe renewables, natural gas and cleaner molecules will be critical in meeting rising energy demand as we transition to an energy future with lower carbon intensity. As an example, United States natural gas production set a record during 2023 for the third consecutive year, fueled by strong domestic demand and record LNG exports, all while still achieving lower carbon emissions over the past several decades as renewables and cleaner burning natural gas replace coal as a fuel source in power generation. Please turn to the next slide. As we modernize our energy grids, the IEA estimates that $11 trillion are expected to be spent in the North American energy sector through 2050, with over $5 trillion focused on T&D investments. Please turn to the next slide. As we've outlined in the past, we've been disciplined and maintaining our focus on what we believe is the higher value, lower risk portion of the energy value chain. In the T&D segment, we make disciplined investments with the view toward producing high quality recurring cash flows from regulated utilities and long-term contracted assets that generally grow with inflation. Please turn to the next slide. As you can see here, our strategy combined with disciplined capital allocation has allowed us to successfully meet or exceed our EPS guidance range for the last 6 years. Over the same time period, our adjusted EPS has compounded annually at approximately 10% since 2018, which is top decile amongst our peers. Please turn to the next slide. Improving our corporate strategy has allowed us to build significant scale into our business for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. And that's been demonstrated by the consistency of our financial performance. It's also noteworthy that we've accomplished this across different market cycles that have included a global pandemic, supply chain shortages, high inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical unrest. In short, our disciplined execution has consistently delivered total shareholder returns at levels that are well above our peer group. Please turn to the next slide. Before I hand the call to Trevor, I'd like to reiterate our key investment highlights. We own high quality T&D growth platforms located in California and Texas and some of North America's most attractive economic markets that also benefit from constructive regulation. We exercise a disciplined approach to capital allocation and are excited to launch our new 5-year capital plan of $48 billion. We believe this sets out a clear roadmap for our future growth and supports our expected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. In conclusion, we're proud of our recent accomplishments and the growing strength of our business franchise. Across our management team, there's a lot of excitement about the opportunities that are ahead of us. Now please turn to the next slide where Trevor who will walk you through the business updates at Sempra California. Trevor Mihalik : Thanks, Jeff. Let me start by highlighting the financial results at Sempra California. Earnings for the full year 2023 were $1.75 billion benefiting from $4.6 billion of capital investments focused on safety, reliability and wildfire mitigation. These investments increased rate base by 11% over 2022. We have long emphasized California's constructive regulatory compact including forward looking rate cases, access to the cost of capital mechanism and an established wildfire fund. And this year, we had several positive regulatory outcomes that reinforced our conviction and supports attracting capital to the state. As Jeff mentioned, last fall the cost of capital mechanism triggered and the CPUC approved increasing our authorized ROE at SDG&E and SoCalGas by 70 basis points. This increase was effective January 1, 2024. In October, we reached settlements for important capital and O&M portions of our rate case requests with certain interveners. And while these settlements are subject to CPUC approval, we're encouraged by that progress. And we anticipate receiving a proposed decision on our GRC in the second quarter. As a reminder, once finalized rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2024. Separately, in addition to the recently awarded transmission projects by CAISO, SDG&E has advanced their competitive bid for the Imperial Valley to the north of SONGS transmission line and expect an update in late April. We're also extremely proud of the recent recognition of our electric business. SDG&E was again awarded best in the West for Electric Reliability for the 18th consecutive year and recognized for their industry leadership in wildfire mitigation predictive modeling technology. The CPUC also recently increased the authorized storage capacity of Aliso Canyon by over 50%. This demonstrates the Commission's recognition of the importance of existing energy infrastructure and the critical role SoCalGas plays in supporting reliability and affordability of both natural gas and electricity in California. And finally, ARCHES, which is one of SoCalGas' strategic partners was selected to receive DOE funding to help develop a regional hydrogen hub. This is important because Los Angeles is one of the nation's largest manufacturing hubs and cleaner molecules are expected to play a pivotal role in helping hard to electrify sector lower their emissions. Please turn to the next slide. Now let's turn to some of the key trends that are supporting growth at Sempra California. We operate in the largest U.S. market representing nearly 15% of national GDP. California is also among the top three states for job growth with nearly 1 million jobs created over the past 5 years. We're also well aligned with the state policy that promotes building an economy based on sustainable energy. Earlier this month, the CPUC made further commitments to renewables mandating the construction of 56 gigawatts of new clean energy by 2035 including over 15 gigawatts of energy storage. California also remains home to the largest source of solar power and the highest penetration rate of electric vehicles of any state in the country. Just in San Diego County, there are now over 140,000 EVs and that number is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. It is also noteworthy that San Diego County leads the state with 23% of our customers having installed rooftop solar systems. These systems are often accompanied by a battery and as battery storage solutions become more cost effective, the need to reliably integrate these technologies on our network is expected to increase. Turning to Los Angeles, The manufacturing sector generates over $80 billion in annual GDP. For customers that require high heat content molecules, RNG and hydrogen will be increasingly important for affordable, reliable and safe operations. When you pair California's economic growth with its ambitious clean energy goals, the need for significant T&D investment is critical to help ensure reliability and affordability. The key takeaway here is that our investment strategy and the rate case filings are closely aligned with public policy and the direction the state is going. Please turn to the next slide. Sempra California is modernizing the T&D infrastructure necessary to integrate more renewables and clean molecules to serve the growing energy needs of customers, while facilitating California's energy transition. As this slide shows, our utilities play a central role in connecting new cleaner sources of energy to a diverse and growing set of customers. We continue to prioritize safety and reliability with a strong focus on maintaining an efficient cost structure. We currently have the lowest build relative to our peers in the state and are in line with the national average. We will always be focused on providing the best possible service while ensuring customer affordability is a top priority. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to our five year capital plan. We're announcing over $24 billion of investments. On the electric side, we are pursuing safe and reliable infrastructure investments, integrating renewable energy, incorporating battery storage, supporting EV infrastructure and hardening the system against event risks. On our natural gas system, we will continue to modernize our gas network, reduce carbon emissions and make investments in energy infrastructure that support the delivery of cleaner molecules. We expect these investments to grow our rate base at an approximate 7% CAGR from 2023 to 2028. We're excited about the growth prospects at Sempra California and we feel fortunate to have the opportunity to deliver safe and reliable energy in a market with a constructive regulatory environment. Please turn to the next slide where Allen will discuss Oncor's accomplishments in Texas. Allen Nye : Thank you, Trevor. Oncor delivered strong financial performance in 2023, deploying $3.8 billion of capital and growing rate base by 12% over the prior year. We were pleased to complete our base rate review at the PUCT and emerged with a constructive outcome where all prior T&D investments by Oncor were deemed prudent and approved. 2023 also marked one of the most successful Texas legislative sessions for our industry in recent history. Several bills that were passed during the 88th Texas legislative session demonstrate the state's commitment to supporting a safer, smarter, more resilient and more reliable electric grid to power continued growth across the state. Oncor has historically worked closely with the Texas Legislature and its many stakeholders to achieve productive outcomes, but this session in particular was incredibly constructive. First, the legislature increased our allowed distribution cost recovery tracker filings to twice a year reducing Oncor's regulatory lag on critical investments. Additionally, the legislature passed HB 2555 which encourages utilities to make their systems more resilient and provides expedited recovery for approved capital and O&M expenditures. The PUCT finalized rules to implement HB 2555 last month. We expect to file our first system resiliency plan or SRP within the next several months. The PUCT is allowed six months to review the SRP, and if approved, we would expect to begin implementation by year end. Distribution capital approved in the SRP will be recovered through our DCRF tracker filings. Regulatory lag that normally accrues between the time of in service and the implementation of rates will be offset by a regulatory asset that will be recovered in our next DCRF. Similarly, O&M expense approved as part of the SRP will be offset by a regulatory asset that will be included for recovery in a subsequent DCRF. Use of this new mechanism should reduce the regulatory lag normally associated with these types of expenditures. We look forward to using the capital in O&M that gets approved under our SRP plan to improve the resiliency of our system, harden the system against storms, extreme weather and wildfire risk, and generally improve our customers' experience, while at the same time improving recovery of the expenditures. From an operational perspective, Oncor continued to execute at a high level. In 2023, we built, rebuilt or upgraded approximately 3,200 miles of T&D lines, while also increasing the number of premises we serve by 73,000. In West Texas alone, we built, rebuilt or upgraded over 650 miles of T&D lines and eight new switching and substations. The Texas grid performed very well through record demand peaks over the last 12 months. Oncor's reliability performance as measured by our non-storm SAIDI score improved by approximately 7% in 2023 compared to the previous year. Finally, in 2023, we set company records for active transmission interconnection requests and new transmission interconnection requests in the queue. Active generation and retail interconnection requests increased 25% year-over-year. New interconnection requests increased 19% year-over-year. Please turn to the next slide. These interconnection requests are driven by the dynamic economic growth that we continue to see in Texas. The Texas Miracle continues and is demonstrated by the continued strong growth both in population and diverse commercial and industrial businesses moving to the state. Oncor serves some of the country's fastest growing metro areas, including 4 of the 15 fastest growing cities. From a sheer scale perspective, Texas GDP is second only to California and continues to grow at a robust pace, growing at approximately 8% during the third quarter, faster than the nation as a whole for the fifth quarter in a row. Texas continues to see electric vehicle penetration as well. Over a recent 12 month period, the DFW Metroplex had the largest increase in EV registrations out of any major metro area in Texas with 63% growth. Please turn to the next slide. Oncor has also seen significant growth in commercial and industrial customers, representing electric loads that are larger than traditional commercial projects. Data center development continues to be robust across our service territory, including new sites that have the potential to support hyperscale computing and generative artificial intelligence services. These projects represent the potential for thousands of megawatts of new electric load, often hundreds of megawatts for just one project. Similarly, electrification of the oil and gas industry in West Texas continues at an impressive pace. Our Permian Basin reliability plan reliability plan update published by ERCOT earlier this month projects that within 15 years, the total demand in West Texas could increase fourfold from its current 6.5 gigawatts to 26 gigawatts. This growth is expected to support oil and gas production as well as general electrification. Oncor will be at the forefront and expanding its system to meet the requirements of these customers. Finally, as the population continues to expand both organically and from relocations, we still expect total premise growth to continue at approximately 2% annually. Each of these developments creates new opportunities to expand the Oncor Energy System. We are positioning ourselves to meet these demands through hiring, supply chain procurement and system planning, and looking forward to continuing to serve our customers in the ERCOT market. Please turn to the next slide. On Sempra's Q3 call, we discussed this growth and announced our intention to increase our capital plan. We are pleased to announce that Oncor's 5-year capital plan for 2024 through 2028 is projected to be $24.2 billion, which is a 26% increase over our previous 5-year capital plan of $19.2 billion. The vast majority of this capital plan is to serve customer growth, although the maintenance needs of our system continue to grow steadily as well. This plan does not include the amount of capital expenditures that we expect to request in the upcoming SRP filing that I mentioned earlier. We expect to file that plan in the first half of this year and the proposed spend will be subject to PUCT review and approval. With today's updated plan, we anticipate Oncor's rate base to grow at an annual average rate of 11% from 2023 to 2028. While historically, our earnings growth rate fell below our rate base growth due to regulatory lag. The addition of enhanced recovery mechanisms arising from the legislative session should move our long-term earnings growth rate closer to our rate base growth rate. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call to Justin to update you on Sempra Infrastructure. Justin Bird : Thanks, Allen. We're also excited about the opportunities in Texas. Sempra Infrastructure is advancing the approximately $13 billion Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project in Texas. This investment along with Oncor's capital plan certainly makes Sempra among the largest investors in the state. At Sempra Infrastructure, we're advancing construction on 5 projects, all of which are on time and on budget and our strategy differentiates us from others in the space. We have a dual coast LNG export strategy, a robust energy network portfolio, and power transmission infrastructure to move more renewable power across the border. All with the goal of delivering cleaner molecules and cleaner electrons to our customers and partners. We've achieved several noteworthy milestones in 2023 declaring positive FID on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was a major success and we secured all required project level debt and equity contributions. Financially, we executed well relative to 2022's strong results and our ability to maintain momentum through 2023 is another indication of our sustainable business model. Sempra Infrastructure's 2023 adjusted earnings were $764 million I'd also like to specifically call out the progress at ECA LNG Phase 1 as it approaches its summer 2025 COD. We are excited to bring one of the first North American Pacific Coast export projects to market. At Cameron LNG Phase 1, we've now exceeded 700 cargoes since production began in May of 2019 and we couldn't be more pleased with the high quality operations from this critical infrastructure asset. On the development growth pipeline, our priorities remain focused on advancing commercial discussions for offtake volume and equity ownership at Port Arthur Phase 2 and assessing Cameron LNG Phase 2's EPC opportunities. At Cameron LNG Phase 2, we've been working with Bechtel on value engineering and at this stage we feel it's best to continue those efforts while evaluating other potential EPC contractors. We're continuing to work closely with Bechtel on Port Arthur Phase 1 and potentially Phase 2, but we and the Cameron partners want to take some additional time to help ensure a cost effective build plan and conduct additional value engineering and analysis to improve the overall value of the project to our customers. At Port Arthur LNG Phase 2, we received FERC approval in September and earlier this month FERC staff issued an environmental assessment finding no adverse impact as a result of the Port Arthur, Louisiana Connector Pipelines amendment. I also want to mention that we continue to make significant progress toward an FID on Cimarron Wind. Recall, this is a 300 megawatt wind project located near our existing ESJ1 and ESJ2 wind projects that will directly interconnect with the California market. Finally, I wanted to highlight a hydrogen hub project we are participating in called High Velocity that is expected to receive $1.2 billion from DOE funding to pursue development. We are also actively engaged with a group of Japanese utilities on a collaboration to produce the natural gas using renewable hydrogen and CO2 as inputs. Projects like these demonstrate Sempra Infrastructure's innovative and entrepreneurial culture as we seek opportunities to provide cleaner and more secure energy for customers. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to macro trends impacting Sempra Infrastructure, global energy demand continues to increase. On sustainability, Sempra infrastructure plays a critical role in providing cleaner alternative solutions to heavier carbon fuels like coal and oil. Natural gas and particularly LNG can effectively replace less sustainable energy sources today. In fact, industry sources estimate that global LNG demand in particular will grow approximately 50% by 2045. There is an additional tailwind associated with emerging market growth as their share of global GDP increases relative to advancing economies. This drives overall energy consumption because developing economies tend to be more energy intensive as they modernize and improve quality of life. Sempra Infrastructure also develops renewables and associated infrastructure that provide cleaner sources of energy and contribute to a broader decarbonization efforts in North America. The final macro driver is the need for energy security. Energy dense, reliable and affordable energy is a key ingredient to building advanced economies. The key question is where that incremental energy production will be sourced. Recently, the DOE announced a pause on granting non FDA LNG export permits to reevaluate the impact granting these permits would have on domestic energy costs and to consider whether climate factors impact the public interest. LNG's climate role is important, which is why even before the regulatory development, we started work on several initiatives designed to minimize our environmental impact and help reduce emissions across our portfolio. One example being the conversion of E drives at Cameron LNG Phase 2. We're also developing carbon capture and sequestration infrastructure associated with our LNG projects. Long-term, we are confident in the commercial, economic and environmental value of our export facilities and we'll continue to work hard on behalf of our customers and investors to advance these projects. With that said, this permitting pause only applies to projects that haven't yet received their non-FDA export permit such as Port Arthur Phase 2. This pause does not impact on any of our assets in operation or under construction. As a reminder, Cameron train 4 has a non FDA export permit and the DOE stated in hearings earlier this month that the pause would not impact in service date extension requests for projects with existing permits. Per Sempra's planning convention, development projects such as Port Arthur Phase 2 and Cameron Phase 2 have not reached FID and are not included in our capital plan or guidance. So, any potential delay would not impact our current earnings growth visibility or our existing capital plan. We can't speculate on the ultimate outcome of this policy, but we'd like to reiterate the compelling environmental value proposition that natural gas and LNG provide. The United States has decreased carbon emissions 17% below 2005 levels despite increasing GDP by more than double in that time. A major reason for that progress is natural gas replacing coal and energy production. We believe a lasting policy of limiting LNG exports would unfortunately hurt the global climate interests, because prospective buyers could be forced to rely on more carbon intensive fuels including coal and fuel oil. We remain as enthusiastic as ever about the merits of our LNG projects as well as our ability to appropriately navigate the regulatory landscape to advance each one. Further, we are optimistic that normal permitting conditions will resume after all relevant variables have been carefully evaluated by the administration. Please turn to the next slide. On this slide, we highlight some key projects under construction in the Pacific and Gulf Coast. These projects strengthen our competitive advantage as a strategically located supplier to both Asia and Europe. The beauty of greenfield development is that it unlocks highly compelling brownfield expansion opportunities. We have begun procurement and engineering activities at Port Arthur, Louisiana pipeline, a pipeline connecting Port Arthur LNG to feed gas in Gillis. We've also begun procurement and engineering at Louisiana Storage, a salt dome natural gas storage facility. These assets will contribute to the larger Port Arthur Energy Hub and demonstrate Sempra Infrastructure's expertise in developing comprehensive energy projects. Meanwhile, construction across the Sempra Infrastructure platforms continues to progress well. At Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, the next milestone will be to commence structural steel. At ECA LNG Phase 1, we are targeting 90% completion of structural steel and at the GRO expansion, we have initiated construction and are targeting completion of the construction of the Mexicali segment later this year. To reiterate, Sempra Infrastructure is playing a key role in securing energy needs and contributing to decarbonization efforts for customers around the globe. Please turn to the next slide. Looking further out, we are developing an enviable portfolio of growth projects and this slide showcases some of our more significant pursuits. For a full list of development assets, please refer to the appendix. I would also note that a number of these projects are brownfield investment opportunities made possible by our initial greenfield investments at Cameron and Port Arthur. Please turn to the next slide. To conclude, we have $4.4 billion of capital deployment opportunities anchored on providing our long-term customers with cleaner and secure energy. And as a reminder, this number only includes projects which have reached a positive FID. Major 2024 investment allocations are slotted for the Port Arthur Energy Hub as Phase 1 construction progresses, ECA LNG Phase 1 as we close in on COD, the GRO pipeline expansion project and the Louisiana storage development. Now, please turn to the next slide and let me turn it over to Karen who will take us through the financial update. Karen Sedgwick : Thank you, Justin. I'm excited to share our year end results and give you more details on our financial plan. Earlier today, Sempra reported Q4 2023 GAAP earnings of $737 million or $1.16 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $438 million or $0.69 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2023 earnings were $719 million or $1.13 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings of $743 million or $1.17 per share. Full year 2023 GAAP earnings were $3.030 billion or $4.79 per share. This compares to 2022 GAAP earnings of $2.94 billion to or $3.31 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2023 earnings were $2,920 million or $4.61 per share. This compares to our previous full year 2022 adjusted earnings of $2,915 million or $4.61 per share. This year's results demonstrate the combined strength of our three growth platforms and sets us up for improved growth in 2024. Please turn to the next slide. Now I will summarize the variance of full year 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period for last year. At Sempra California, we had $69 million of higher net interest expense, partially offset by net tax benefits, offset by $51 million of higher electric transmission and CPUC based operating margin and $52 million of higher regulatory interest income and regulatory awards. At Sempra Texas, we had $2 million of higher equity earnings attributable to increased invested capital, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses. I'd note that earnings in 2022 and 2023 were impacted by the lack of capital trackers that can't be filed during a rate case. At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $85 million of higher earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, $10 million of higher taxes, partially offset by lower interest expense given increased capitalized interest, offset by $49 million of higher transportation tariffs, higher asset supply optimization, partially offset by lower equity earnings from Cameron LNG. For Port Arthur, while our ownership stake is approximately 20%, we consolidate the project for accounting purposes, thus capitalizing interest based on the projects in progress construction. As construction advances, you're seeing the impact of higher capitalized interest versus previous years. Ultimately, these capitalized costs will be amortized back as higher depreciation after the plant moves into commercial operations. At Sempra Parent, there were $15 million of higher investment gains, partially offset by higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefits. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to new investments, as Jeff noted earlier, we're announcing a company record $48 billion capital plan with over 90% of the planned investment allocated to our regulated utilities. This represents an impressive 20% increase over the previous plan and will ultimately serve as a foundation for our company's growth over the coming years. About $24.1 billion or roughly half of the capital plan is marked for investment at Sempra California's 2 utilities, which together have a weighted average ROE of approximately 10.5%. At Sempra Texas, $19.5 billion includes our proportionate share of Oncor's planned CapEx, where recent legislative development should help Oncor reduce regulatory lag and improve its ability to help lessen the gap between the authorized and actual rates of return. The remaining $4.4 billion are primarily associated with Sempra Infrastructure's LNG projects under construction and their associated infrastructure. Please turn to the next slide. With this record capital plan, I would like to illustrate some of the key sources and uses. As you know, Sempra raised equity in November 2023 to support our future investment needs and mitigate the financing risks associated with the capital plan. As a result, we are in a strong financial position and anticipate a reliable internal operating cash flows and regulatory authorized debt will provide the vast majority of our financing needs. We are a growing business while maintaining balance sheet strength, all with the goal of delivering attractive total shareholder returns over the long-term. Along those lines, Sempra will continue to target a 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio, providing plenty of reinvestment flexibility. Please turn to the next slide. Moving to the utilities, our strong earnings trajectory is underpinned by long-term rate base growth. California and Texas rate base is expected to grow with 7% and 11% respectively from 2023 to 2028. Our rate base is split approximately evenly between California and Texas, where we benefit from constructive regulatory jurisdictions and strong macroeconomic growth. On a combined basis, we anticipate just over 9% annual growth through 2028. And this gives us added confidence in achieving our projected 6% to 8% long-term EPS growth rate. Please turn to the next slide. Given the strength of our 2023 results, we've narrowed our 2024 earnings guidance estimates and are now projecting EPS guidance for the year ranging from $4.60 to $4.90. Also, we're announcing 2025 earnings per share guidance with a range of $4.90 to $5.25. This equates to a projected EPS midpoint that's about 7% higher than 2024 guidance. Now, let's break down a few of the assumptions embedded in these figures. At Sempra, California, this already includes the cost of capital trigger. As for the GRC, we're assuming outcomes that are in the range of historical rate case decisions and continue to work constructively with the CPUC and interveners through the proceeding to achieve an outcome that allows us to continue to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable energy for our customers. Turning to Texas, we said in the prior call, the guidance took into effect Oncor's second DCRF. Subject to PUCT approval, the system resiliency plan will apply to 2025 through 2027. And due to timing differences between filing and construction of projects, we'd expect minimal financial impact in 2025. At Sempra Infrastructure, there are a few things to highlight. 2022 and 2023 benefited from an attractive commodity price environment and in 2023 received the cumulative benefit of new tariffs on select Mexico pipelines. Due to the conservative nature of our project development process, we secured rights on the gas pipeline connecting ICA well in advance of COD. This allowed us to better optimize results during this period, but we would expect this impact to moderate as we go forward, particularly with a lower forward curve for natural gas. And now with the magnitude of large projects currently under construction, we have better visibility to certain non-capitalized costs that have now been added to our 2024 plan. And we have ECA LNG Phase 1 expected to come online in the summer of 2025, with full year operations expected in 2026. And finally, regarding the share count, the main driver of the increase is our recent equity offering. As we've discussed, the green shoe of just over 2 million shares settled immediately in November of 2023. Over the course of this year, we're assuming weighted average diluted shares will increase by 4 million which reflects the dividend reinvestment program, equity based plans and the drawdown of our forward settlement, which we now assume will occur in the second half of 2024. Thus 2025 reflects those shares outstanding for the entire year, increasing our share count to approximately 654 million shares. Please turn to the next slide. In addition to our new 5-year plan, we've added this slide in an effort to be more responsive to input from our many investors. Here, it shows the various categories of investments that we're tracking or developing that fall outside of our current plan. It totals over $10 billion and many of these opportunities could form part of our future capital campaign. Please turn to the next slide. You've heard this from our other executives today, but it is important to note that we're excited by the investment opportunities in front of us. We are owners and operators of top tier T&D utility platforms located in North America's largest economies. Moreover, our utilities benefit from constructive regulation that supports significant investment and help ensure safe, reliable, resilient and increasingly sustainable energy for our customers. Over time, our key priorities remain largely the same. We will invest in our high quality T&D infrastructure to improve customer service, maintain a prudent balance sheet and provide compelling returns to shareholders. A record $48 billion capital plan focused on our regulated utilities will be the primary foundation for increasing rate base, growth in earnings power and gives us confidence in achieving our projected long term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. We thank you for joining us as we continue to build North America's premier energy infrastructure company and we're as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to continue delivering attractive risk adjusted returns. I've had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last month, and I'll be out on the road with the IR team in March and hope to connect with those of you I haven't had a chance to meet yet. With that, I'd now like to open the call for some of your questions. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now open the line to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Constantine Lednev from Guggenheim Partners. Constantine Lednev : The first one would be on the 2025 earnings growth in California that's pointing to around 5%. How are you currently framing the GRC process into the 2024, 2025 planning assumptions, especially there's some visibility around partial settlement issues in the process? Jeff Martin : Here's the way I would think about it is, the way we framed our rate cases, we always focus on making investments that are aligned with public policy and to directly support our customers. In terms of assumptions, we take the time to look at prior cases we've been through at the CPUC and then we tend to make reasonable assumptions from a range of potential outcomes. Our challenge is given where we're at in the regulatory process, that's probably all we're prepared to share in terms of assumptions at this time. But you did make a great point, which is just last fall, we've settled with certain interveners about one-third of the rate case for the Southern California Gas Company and about one-third of the case for SDG&E and we do that quite constructively. So we're looking forward to a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision in the second half of the year. Constantine Lednev : And does that imply that you're taking into account any of the settlement into your planning parameters or is that still outbound? Jeff Martin : No. I wouldn't think about the settlement itself impacting how we think about our assumptions. I just think it views an alignment with some of the interveners around the way we're thinking about meeting the public policy initiatives for the state. Constantine Lednev : And then maybe shifting to your thoughts on cost of capital process at the CPUC, especially with Phase 2 reply comments posted yesterday and benchmark years or yields are clearly pointing to a sustained increase, but how do you just bookend the assumptions on the 5-year total plan? Jeff Martin : Yes. Here's the way I would think about it and I will also see if Trevor would like to add something. As you recall, when this issue was first addressed last year, we had indicated to the investment community that we expected the cost of capital mechanism to trigger and had it included in our EPS guidance. And now with the decision last December which we think was fairly clear, it allowed us Constantine to have a little bit more confidence to narrow our 2024 EPS guidance range and as you know that had the benefit of actually raising the midpoint of our guidance for this year. Broadly, I think California continues to be a very constructive regulatory jurisdiction. I always point to the fact that we have forward-looking rate cases here, reasonable returns on equity to attract the capital that's needed, a strong framework is actually quite unique for addressing climate related event risk. And finally, more and more people are starting to understand and value the cost of capital mechanism that accounts for market conditions. But Trevor, would you like to add anything in terms of the cost of capital? Trevor Mihalik : Yes, Jeff. No, I think you largely covered it. I would just add that I think we are really in good shape here on this. And I think the Energy Division's disposition letter was pretty clear on this. So again, we feel we're in good shape. Constantine Lednev : And so just one quick follow-up, again, embedded within kind of that ROE outcome. Do you have any O&M kind of funding or system reinvestment embedded in plan? Jeff Martin : Help me understand your question again, please. Constantine Lednev : Just with the tailwinds from the ROE outcome, are you embedding any reinvestment in O&M from that tailwind going into '24? Jeff Martin : The way I would think about it is when we put our plan together which was all part of the current rate case, so the 2024 plan would be impacted by how the outcome of the rate case is. And when we think about '24 and '25, we had to take a reasonable set of assumptions based upon prior cases and that's embedded in our forecast. Operator : And our next question will come from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Nick Campanella : So I guess just you're going to file this SRP. It sounds like CapEx is biased yet again higher on the other side of that, probably a second half event, but just how are you kind of describing your capital needs and how you would fund increased CapEx, equity debt, etcetera? Jeff Martin : Yes. I will start, Nick, by reminding everyone. On our Q3 call last year we shared our expectation that our capital plan would go up between 10% and 20%. And in that same month, you'll recall that we sized our equity offering of roughly $1.3 billion to support our future financing needs. Slide 33, Nick, goes through kind of the sources and uses and picks up last fall's equity issuance and the ongoing DRIP. I think to your point, the key takeaway for us is we're in great shape. Together with our operating cash flows and net debt, we're in a very strong position to comfortably support our new capital program without the need for any additional equity. Nick Campanella : And then I'm sorry, but just on top of as you raise CapEx, I think again, if this SRP filing is not included in the current CapEx plan, is there an incremental funding need on top of that and just how to think about that? Is there capacity, I guess, to raise additional CapEx without equity here? Should we just kind of be doing some equity going forward? Sorry about that, Craig. Jeff Martin : No. When we sized our equity needs last fall, we made sure that we did that with a margin around what we were trying to accomplish in terms of financing our future growth. So, we have the capability of funding growth beyond $48 billion without raising additional equity. The challenge you get into is when you look at the slide that we've provided, it shows other opportunities. There's an additional $10 billion out there. So it's not just SRP, we've got other projects which are coming down the pipe. But I think the great news is we've got a record capital plan. That capital plan is roughly $3 billion larger than our current market capitalization and we were thoughtful last fall to take the equity overhang off of our stock and make sure that we had a margin of error to fully fund our capital plan with additional growth. Nick Campanella : And then, I guess just turning to the Sempra Infrastructure earnings guidance. Absolutely appreciate there's a step up 2024 versus '25 because of ECA. Are you assuming just kind of like a midyear COD there? And just I'm just trying to get a sense of what the normalized run rate for ECA is when that kind of comes online, if you could isolate that. And are there any other kind of drivers to point to in terms of the strength for '25 versus '24? Jeff Martin : Yes. I would just give you two things to focus on and Karen you can add if you like to. But what I would mention is you're going to see a little bit higher development expense is not capitalized in 2024, and I would use a half year convention for 2025. And that's the best way to think about your going forward run rate? Karen Sedgwick : Yes. And I would just add that, as you would expect, financial projections include the incremental revenues associated with the SPA contracts, the commissioning volumes recognized after substantial completion of the facility and the contributions from the GRO pipeline. So bringing on the first phase of the Pacific Coast LNG facility is really an exciting opportunity and differentiates Sempra Infrastructure with a dual coast business model that will serve global energy demand. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on the value engineering timeframe on Cameron. I'm curious if there's any way you could bracket how long you've extended that process for? Jeff Martin : Yes. So what might be helpful here, David, is if you could, Justin, do two things if you've got a moment? Go ahead and talk about, if you would, just a brief update on the construction at both ECA and Port Arthur and then come back to the development question he's asking specifically how we're trying to create additional value around the Cameron opportunity. Justin Bird : We're excited to share that on ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur Phase 1, we're seeing both projects remain on track for construction. ECA Phase 1 for COD in the summer of 2025 and for Port Arthur Train 1, 2027 and Train 2 in 2028. Moving along to the development projects, you recall that as part of our commitment to deliver superior risk adjusted returns, I always talk about the reverse Field of Dreams model, which is when they come, I'll build it. Along those same lines, I always say that we'll only move forward with our projects when we have the right cost and risk structure and long-term contracted cash flows that support a strong return for our shareholders. So going to the heart of your question David, on Phase 2, we're seeing significant commercial demand for low cost brownfield LNG assets, particularly those that have permits in hand. And we believe that Cameron will be one of the most technologically advanced LNG facilities in the world and have one of the lowest emission profiles. As we've shifted to electric drives, we're working on a green power tariff and we'll have carbon sequestration. As you recall, it's fully permitted and we're working toward an FID. The four work streams that always talk about continue to make progress, but we still have some work to be done. So our current efforts with respect to the Cameron Partners are focused on optimizing costs and ensuring maximum value for the project. And for example, we're exploring procurement or reservation of long lead and critical path equipment. We are anticipating taking an FID on Cameron 2 as early as the first half of next year. So that's the first half of 2025. Shifting to Port Arthur, we received our FERC permit last September and are now awaiting the DOE non-FTA export permit. We're continuing to work with Bechtel on an EPC agreement that can optimize efficiencies with the Phase 1 construction schedule. And we're continuing our marketing efforts for offtake and equity and having financing discussions with potential lenders. We also have our other Pacific Coast LNG opportunities Phase 2 at ECA and Vista Pacifico. Both of these are in the early stages of development, but we see clear opportunities and excitement around these projects. So just as a reminder, per our planning convention, none of these projects have yet received positive FID. They're not included in our plan and represent upside to the plan and future earnings. Jeff Martin : So David, I would just conclude that with that additional work in terms of securing long lead time items and additional value engineering, we're focusing on trying to take FID on that project in the first half of next year. Operator : Our next question will come from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Maybe just to start, as we think about the 5-year capital plan increasing by the 20%, you've reiterated the long-term growth rate of the 6% to 8%. But just curious, given the magnitude of that increase. How we should thing about the rate base and earnings growth relative that range over the current period? Jeff Martin : Well, it's interesting you asked that. The rate base growth across both of our utilities will be approximately 10%, which is a little bit stronger than we forecasted a year ago. At the end of the planning period, those two platforms will have $78 billion of rate base and we really view that really as the focus of the capital plan. As we indicated, it captures over 90% of that $48 billion. What is of note is that there's an $8 billion increase over the prior plan and over half of that, Carly, comes from the growth that we're seeing in Texas, which is really the strongest part of our story. But we continue to think that the most important thing is we have been messaged at around a 6% to 8% growth rate for several years now. I think this type of visibility causes us to have additional confidence in that number. And one of the things I think that you and I have discussed before, if you look at Slide 10, at the last 5 or 6 years or go back over 10 years or 15 or 20, Sempra is one of those few companies that's been able to perform earnings per share growth in that 7% to 10% range over long periods of time. Now we're certainly forecasting the 6% to 8% on a go forward basis. But the key takeaway from this plan is we have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver that. I think as you've noted in your prior research, I've often indicated that I would be disappointed if we don't outperform the high end of that range. Carly Davenport : And then maybe just to follow-up on Texas. I think you mentioned in the slides planning for 2% annual premise growth. Do you think that could be conservative just based on what you've seen recently and the different growth opportunities that you've seen in Texas? Jeff Martin : Yes. I mentioned that over half of our planning increase came from Texas and I wouldn't mind having Allen walk us through where the system, where the growth is showing up. The story in Texas, I think, which is quite unique, is not just, it's the diversity of the growth in Texas, not just on the premise side, and it's also the amount of it Carly that's allocated to transmission. I don't think there's another growth story in the United States that is majority of CapEx is related to transmission. And the reason that's important is Allen's team has the lowest transmission distribution bills in the state and transmission projects because it benefits all ratepayers in the state, gets socialized across all the different jurisdictions. But Allen, to Carly's point, maybe you could talk about premise growth more broadly, the growth that showed up on the system. Allen Nye : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jeff. And hey, Carly. Really interesting question given what we're seeing on our system. And as Jeff said and as I said in my opening remarks, we continue to see really very strong record breaking growth across our system. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, premise growth remains very strong 73,000 last year, 14% increase year-over-year. From a transmission perspective, transmission points of interconnection, very large customers connecting a transmission voltage. We set New Year end records for new and active points of interconnection '23. Total interconnections are up 25% year-over-year. New interconnections are up 19% year-over-year. And then we always break it down into retail and generation. Retail is up 13%, but I want to pause there on the 13%. So we go from 250 at the end of '22 to 282 at the end of '23. But something to Jeff's point that's significant about our growth is not only the numbers but kind of the magnitude and the diversity of the customers. And so in these retail numbers of the 282 retail point of interconnection request we presently have, 46 of those are between 300 megawatts and 2,600 megawatts individually in size. We actually have about 28 that are between 300 and 600 megawatts a piece and we have about 18 that are between 602.6 gigs. So very long, very strong growth numerically just in the increase of the numbers, but also what we're seeing is the size of the customers. On the generation interconnection side, we see an increase of 34% year-over-year. West Texas, we always talk about West Texas continues to be a very strong story for us with the far West Texas weather zone peak increasing by 16.6% year-over-year. The 2 transmission circuits or rather loops that we use to serve that part of the state. The Culberson loop saw a peak that was almost 18% above the prior year's peak and Stanton increased about just under 24%. So really, really incredibly strong growth across our system. Breakdown of CapEx, Jeff? Breakdown of our $24.2 billion it's on Slide 48 of the appendix. Just to break it down a little further, we've got about $5.1 billion in distribution expansion, about $13.5 million in transmission expansion, which is a point Jeff made moments ago. About $4.2 billion in maintenance capital and then about $1.4 billion in tech. And I think to Jeff's point, three things here just to conclude. One, 70%, a little over 70% actually of all this CapEx is pure growth capital. About 97% of this 5-year plan is subject to recovery through our trackers. And then to Jeff's point specifically, a little over 60% of all this capital we're talking about is transmission, which obviously benefits everyone in the state and therefore is spread across the state evenly, which helps us both to grow capital as well as the fact the heavy emphasis on transmission really allows us to stay where we want to be, which is among the low cost providers in the state. Operator : We now have time for one more question, and it will be from Ryan Levine from Citi. Ryan Levine : Two questions. One on transmission in the prepared remarks, as mentioned, we should expect an update in late April for your project or the project that you're pursuing. Should we expect an outcome there or just further update as there's a range of potential scenarios that could play out in the coming weeks? Jeff Martin : Thank you for that question, Ryan. I'll let Trevor respond. Trevor Mihalik : Sure, Jeff. Hey, Ryan. Yes, I think we'll get a decision as to who's going to get selected in late April and then there's 120 days for negotiations to happen for a final outcome. So I would say expect something over the next 4 months. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then on LNG, appreciate the clarification around the non FDA permanent extension with new applications. In terms of non FDA permanent extensions, is there a historic timeline around how long that typically takes? And does the pause for new applications potentially accelerate the timeline for extensions as there's allocation of resource issues? Jeff Martin : No. We have used the extension process for different projects in the past and I would say there's not a standard time line for that. I think we were just pleased to see the DOE confirm that it was a separate process for extensions rather than for new filings. The filing that we've made for Port Arthur Phase 2 is pending. We just have to wait through this process of the pause. But I think one of the points, Ryan, that Justin made in his discussion was we have a whole series of development milestones that we're pursuing for Port Arthur Phase 2. We think it's a very attractive, commercially viable project. I think those milestones, we've worked through concurrently with the ultimate permitting process. So whether it ends up being a delay for the project or it's actually completed consistent with the time line for other milestones remains to be seen. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks. Jeff Martin : I wanted to briefly thank everyone for joining us today. I know there were several competing calls and even conferences this morning, so we appreciate everyone making the time to join us. If there are any follow-up items, please reach out to our IR team with any questions. Thank you again, and this concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Group President, Sempra California; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. I'd also like to mention that forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, May 7, 2024, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Martin : Thank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to report our first quarter financial results. It's a great start to the year and sets us up well to provide strong financial performance for 2024. In addition to the strength of our financial performance, the market backdrop for energy infrastructure continues to be very constructive. We're seeing strong macroeconomic fundamentals supporting U.S. energy demand, with the economy continuing to grow at a steady pace, with manufacturing production gains, easing of supply chain constraints, and continued job creation. We previously discussed the view that our industry is experiencing a super cycle of growth and believe Sempra's strategy and portfolio are well positioned to benefit from current trends. In addition to the long-term demand from reshoring and electrification of transportation, artificial intelligence and data centers are driving new growth in digital infrastructure with demand estimates tripling from 2.5% of total U.S. electric consumption to 7.5% by 2030. Growth in Texas is also particularly remarkable with ERCOT recently raising its forecasted peak demand by the end of the decade to over 150 gigawatts. Of note, that's 65 gigawatts higher than the all-time record in the state. Against the backdrop of strong industry fundamentals, Sempra offers several competitive advantages : First, in California, we're at the forefront of the energy transition, serving 25 million consumers in the country's largest economy and one of the largest manufacturing bases in the U.S. And through our general rate cases, we're expecting to make new investments that support electrification and decarbonization while also improving affordability, safety, and reliability. Turning to Texas, we're seeing diverse industrial, C&I and residential growth, which is creating jobs, increase in electricity demand and requiring significant investments to modernize and expand the electricity grid. With economic expansion, the safety and resilience of the grid becomes even more critical, and in part, that's why Oncor's recently filed system resiliency plan is both timely and important. Allen will speak to this in greater detail later in today's presentation. And finally, at Sempra Infrastructure, we're supporting global demand for energy security are in the midst of a second wave of LNG developments expected to support over 700 million tonnes per annum of demand by 2050. Our dual-coast LNG strategy is contributing to this push with approximately 16 million tonnes per annum of new export capacity currently under construction, which would more than double our existing LNG operating footprint. The key takeaway is we're excited about the opportunities ahead as Sempra Infrastructure looks to provide cleaner and more reliable sources of energy to its customers while charting a course for attractive built-in growth through the end of the decade. It's also important to note that Sempra Infrastructure's growth forecasts are based solely on projects that have reached FID and are under construction and doesn't yet include expected upside from a series of other projects still in development. Turning now to our financial results. We reported first quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.34. In addition, we're pleased to also affirm our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 to $4.90 and 2025 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.25. As a reminder, when you look at our adjusted EPS guidance range from 2023 to 2025, it reflects approximately 7% annual growth, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth expectations of 6% to 8%. Please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Karen to provide several business updates. Karen Sedgwick : Thank you, Jeff. We've previously said that 2024 will be an important year of execution at each of our growth platforms, and I'm excited to provide an update on our progress. At Sempra California, we continue to see constructive regulatory outcomes. In March, the CPUC issued a proposed decision supporting the updated return on equity that was implemented this year as part of the CCM trigger. The commission agreed that the current cost of capital mechanism operated as designed, and the recently established returns on equity at SDG&E of 10.65% and at SoCalGas of 10.5% should remain in place through 2025 unless market conditions result in a trigger. Importantly, this improves regulatory certainty by affirming the protection that the CCM provides to customers and shareholders. And the key takeaway is that this is another constructive data point for California's regulatory framework. Another example of this is rate reform. Improving affordability for all of our utility customers is a top priority. And I'm pleased to share that a proposed decision was issued at the CPUC in March to implement a fixed charge for residential electric customers. As currently proposed, this will reduce volumetric rates, support a more fair rate structure, and help California meet its clean energy goals. A final decision is expected in the second quarter of 2024, and the fixed charge would then be expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. During the quarter, we also made a joint filing with the other California utilities to develop projects that successfully demonstrate blending hydrogen into the natural gas system. These projects will begin blending at up to 5% on isolated sections of the natural gas system and incrementally increase the hydrogen concentration based on safety and technical feasibility. Hydrogen blending has been demonstrated safely and reliably around the world for decades. And we look forward to working with our partners to support new and improved ways to expand decarbonization efforts here in the state. Turning to the GRC. We expect a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision this year. Once the final decision is obtained, it will be retroactive to the beginning of the year. As a reminder, after we receive a final decision, we will have a clear regulatory pathway for execution on our utility-focused capital plan through 2027. Lastly, CAISO updated SDG&E that it was not selected to move forward on the Imperial Valley transmission line and substation. It's important to note that we were financially disciplined in how we developed our bid, and we look forward to supporting the project's successful development as well as building the other transmission projects that were directly awarded to SDG&E by CAISO. Turning to Texas, we continue to see significant growth across Oncor's service territory. Just last month, ERCOT issued an updated transmission planning report, forecasting approximately 40% higher load in 2030 than in last year's report. And yesterday, Oncor made its inaugural SRP filing, which includes approximately $3 billion of capital investments. In addition to SRP, the 2023 legislative session was particularly constructive for the state's utilities. We're already seeing the positive impacts at Oncor in terms of the planning and execution that support the state's priorities and improve the timing of the company's returns on capital. Moving to Sempra Infrastructure. We're very excited about the opportunity to help deliver cleaner energy to our customers and partners. Recently, we declared a positive FID at our Cimarr\u00f3n Wind Expansion project. This project demonstrates our ability to generate attractive returns while utilizing existing company-owned transmission capacity to serve the California market and targeting O&M efficiencies based on locational advantages. Additionally, we're making great progress at ECA LNG Phase 1 and Port Arthur LNG Phase I. ECA is roughly 80% complete and remains on target to start commercial operations in the summer of 2025. Port Arthur also remains on schedule with significant ongoing construction activity, including excellent progress around soil stabilization, new foundations, and the commencement of concrete pouring and structural steel work. Turning to our marketing efforts. The LNG market is long term by nature, and while the DOE pause has received a lot of press, we remain confident in our ability to deliver projects that offer long-term, secure, and cleaner energy to customers. Sempra Infrastructure benefits from experienced project development teams that continue to make progress on critical work streams, including permitting, engineering, and commercial negotiations. Moreover, the referenced pause does not impact our confidence in the overall competitive positioning of our development projects, and we're strategically utilizing this time to steadily advance our opportunities. Also of note, even if you only take into consideration projects that have reached FID, Sempra Infrastructure has incredible built-in growth. With 16 million tonnes per annum of LNG export facilities, associated infrastructure, and a new wind project under construction, we're improving visibility to attractive earnings growth through the end of our planning period in 2028. And that's all before taking into account our development project pipeline, which Jeff referenced earlier and offers notable upside. We can now turn to the next slide where Allen will discuss ERCOT's new planning processes. E. Nye: Thank you, Karen. As we have been discussing for several quarters now, Texas continues to experience strong demand growth. Oncor now serves close to 13 million customers and has now surpassed over 4 million meters. ERCOT is adapting to this growth with a recently announced new planning process to account for higher expected electricity needs in the future. In April, ERCOT announced that peak load is expected to reach 152 gigawatts in 2030, nearly double the record set last year of 85 gigawatts. This load growth is coming from a wide range of industries across the state, including new and expanded C&I, electrification of oil and gas operations, data centers, manufacturing, and residential.  To put this growth in context, the change from 2023 to 2030 would be like adding load greater than the size of the entire California power market. Currently, we anticipate that approximately 40% of the new load will come from Oncor service territory. So from our perspective, as one of the premier builders of T&D infrastructure in America, we are excited about the opportunity to continue to scale our investments in electric infrastructure. Since 2018, Oncor has constructed approximately 13,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines, approximately 6 miles per day. We have an active planning process underway and are confident in our ability to secure the materials and labor necessary to serve our customers in the ERCOT market.  Please turn to the next slide. Given the growth in the state, resiliency is more critical than ever. In 2023, the Texas legislature passed House Bill 2555, which allows electric utilities to file system resiliency plans proposing capital and operational expenditures to improve overall grid resiliency. We made our first filing yesterday for approximately $3 billion of new capital expenditures and just over $500 million of operating expenditures to be made over a period of 3 years. This investment would address overhead and underground system resiliency and modernization, flexible and self-healing distribution system, vegetation management, wildfire mitigation, and cyber and physical security.  To provide some additional color, the majority of our proposed spend is in the modernization and hardening of the older parts of our distribution system by adding lightning protection, stronger class poles and cross arms, and addressing capacity constrained parts of the grid during extreme temperatures. Furthermore, we are proposing significant technology and infrastructure investments that will help enable the automated reconfiguration of our system when extreme storms hit, quickly restoring service to customers on undamaged segments by intelligently rerouting power.  I would also like to highlight that we have invested in wildfire mitigation for many years, including effectively partnering with industry leaders like SDG&E and the Texas [ A&M ] Forest Service. Now thanks to HB 2555, Oncor has an additional opportunity to further accelerate our wildfire mitigation strategies across our service territory. We estimate that approximately $900 million of the total proposed spend, including both CapEx and OpEx, will focus on expanding our wildfire mitigation tools and implementing our grid modernization and hardening measures in wildfire-prone areas.  Procedurally, the SRP statute provides 180 days for the PUCT to review the filing, and we anticipate having a decision by the end of the year. The SRP program, with approximately $3 billion of capital expenditures if approved, would be incremental to Oncor's $24.2 billion of planned CapEx announced earlier this year for the 5-year period 2024 to 2028. We believe our proposed SRP creates an opportunity to fundamentally improve customer reliability and overall customer service during and after extreme weather events while also helping to mitigate other risks. I will now turn the call back to Karen to walk through Sempra's financial update. Karen Sedgwick : Thanks, Allen. Earlier today, Sempra reported first quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $801 million or $1.26 per share. This compares to first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $969 million or $1.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2024 earnings were $854 million or $1.34 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2023 earnings of $922 million or $1.46 per share.  Please turn to the next slide. Variances in the first quarter 2024 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized as follows : at Sempra California, we had $24 million primarily from higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefits and $12 million of lower CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, offset by higher authorized cost of capital. As a reminder, because our GRC is still pending, our CPUC revenues in first quarter 2024 are still based on 2023 authorized levels. This is important because any true-up later this year will be retroactively applied to January 1 when the final decision is approved.  Turning to Sempra Texas. We had $56 million of higher equity earnings attributable to rate updates, increased invested capital, and consumption, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses. At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $13 million of lower transportation revenues and higher O&M, partially offset by higher power results, and $27 million of lower asset and supply optimization, partially offset by lower net interest expense due to capitalized interest, lower taxes and other. As a note, beginning this year, the waterfall numbers are presented after noncontrolling interest to improve comparability.  At Sempra Parent, the $48 million quarter-over-quarter change is primarily due to higher taxes from the interim period application of an annual forecasted consolidated effective tax rate, which is expected to turn around over the course of the year.  Please turn to the next slide. Before we close out our prepared remarks, I want to outline Sempra's value proposition as we execute our corporate strategy. At Sempra, our management team is committed to challenging the status quo in all aspects of our business operations. We offer exposure to growth in some of North America's largest economic markets. Our position as a leader in the infrastructure development in these markets translates into a record $48 billion capital campaign through 2028.  In addition, we make energy infrastructure investments that target attractive mid-teens returns on equity, and we understand that disciplined capital allocation is central to our success. And we understand the importance of returning capital to our owners and expect to continue growing our dividend. Of note, we've successfully grown our dividend at a rate of roughly 7% annually over the last 10 years. This is particularly noteworthy, given the expected strength of our future earnings growth.  To conclude, the role of our industry is becoming increasingly important to society, and at Sempra, we're excited about the prospects ahead of us. Sempra is competitively positioned to capitalize on opportunities, and we'll continue to invest in our people, prudently manage risks, efficiently finance our businesses, and be good stewards of the capital entrusted to us. We thank you for joining us, and I'd now like to open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Maybe just starting off on the kind of the incremental upsides that's starting to build versus the 4Q plan, including at SIP and the SRP in Texas. I guess, does the existing financing plan have room to support the spend in '25 through '27? And would you look to maybe utilize some SIP balance sheet capacity to offset potential equity needs from incremental CapEx that we could see coming? Jeffery Martin : Yes, I appreciate the question. And I think we're in good shape on our balance sheet. I'll remind everyone, Shar, that we have a track record of efficiently financing our growth and that's been a big part of our success, as you know, since 2018. In fact, over the last 5 years, we've been successful at growing our adjusted EPS at roughly a 10% annual growth rate. Our current plan, as you know, contemplates we'll make about $48 million of investments through 2028. We certainly think there's opportunities to continue to grow that plan.  But I would also mention that well in advance of announcing our capital plan, Shar, we got our equity needs out of the way last fall. So the key takeaway is we're in great shape with no need for additional equity. We have great visibility to our future growth, and I think you indicated a couple of levers that we have to pull. And we have a plan in place that should allow us to officially finance our growth. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. So you're comfortable with the balance sheet and if there's incremental CapEx coming? That's helpful, Jeff. Jeffery Martin : Yes, we are. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. And then just given the cost of capital affirmation in California, I guess, how are you planning maybe to recognize the impacts of the CCM? Is there a customer reinvestment plan? And would you kind of plan to provide an update on the California Utilities earnings after the PD? Jeffery Martin : Yes. I think there's going to be an opportunity as we get through our rate case. You'll recall that we're expecting to have our proposed decision later this quarter and a final decision at the end of the year. And those are the type of issues that we would reconcile on the then next earnings call, which could be as early as Q3 to make sure we provide real clear visibility to the impact of the rate case on our forward earnings. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities. Jeremy Tonet : Turning to Texas, I was just wondering if you could frame this latest ERCOT load growth outlook against the last capital plan raised by Oncor. Is that level of system investment contemplated consistent with this load growth? Or is there even more, I guess, upside down the pipe here? And if so, what time frame do you think that could make it into the plan? Jeffery Martin : Well, it's certainly a great question. Obviously, ERCOT just released their latest information in the last couple of weeks. Allen noted this in his prepared remarks, but it's pretty amazing that you could take the peak demand load in America's largest economic environment, which is California, and the expectation is in Texas that look to grow back much between now and 2030. The key thing that Allen has mentioned before, too, is ERCOT is right in the middle of this growth story, right? So as you think about growth opportunities, we think that between 40% and 50% of that would fall to his service territory. And there's no question that this will be evaluated in the fall as Allen and his team put their plan together. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. And then digging again on the SRP a little bit more, I was just wondering if you could kind of bracket what this work will accomplish over the next 3 years relative to overall resiliency needs you see in the system. Jeffery Martin : Yes, let me make a couple of kind of contextual comments, and I'll turn it over to Allen. Just yesterday, they made their inaugural filing. You know from our materials, it's $3 billion over 3 years. And one of the things that we're interested in at Sempra, very much like all the investments that we make across our different growth platforms, this plan is intended to harden our system to withstand extreme weather conditions, reduce restoration outage times and improve overall reliability.  I would also note, Jeremy, that the requested capital is incremental to Oncor's existing capital plan. But Allen, what might be helpful, and I think this will go to the heart of this question is, can we just take a step back, talk about your overall $24 billion capital plan? Why the SRP piece is so important? And maybe I'll return to kind of the value proposition to your regulator. E. Nye: Yes, sure, Jeff. And thanks for the question, Jeremy. Going back to Jeff's point to our original -- our current 5-year capital plan is presently at $24.2 billion. And that breaks down generally into about $5.1 billion for distribution expansion, about $13.5 billion for transmission expansion, $4.2 billion for maintenance, and about $1.4 billion for technology. And again, as I've said before, that demonstrates about 70% of our capital plan is growth. 97% of our capital plan or more is recoverable through our trackers, and that provides us right now with a very, we think, solid industry-leading rate base CAGR of around 11%.  Now obviously, that's before the SRP and whatever the commission ultimately rules on our SRP. We feel -- we're very excited about the plan we filed. I think our team has done a great job in preparing a very strong plan that will have, I think, significant benefits for our customers. And if I can, I can break it down a little more into what we filed. Our SRP is generally broken down into 6 major categories. The first one being overhead and underground resiliency and modernization. That includes things like new and repaired poles, cross arms, lightning protection, increased capacity for high demand days, rehab or replacement of underground conductor. And so in that first category, that's around $1.830 billion in the first category. Our second category is continued optimization of distribution automation. And what we're talking about there is expansion of our distribution automation program through new ties, increased capacity and the addition of intelligence switches. And we have about $510 million in that bucket. The third category is expanded vegetation management or VM. We're going to do that primarily on a bunch of lateral circuits, and we're going to leverage remote sensing capabilities such as satellite and LiDAR to better direct our VM program moving forward through this program. We have about $285 million allotted to expand the VM in this plan.  Fourth category is enhancing our cyber risk management. That means all things cyber risk-related mitigation as well as enhancement in security related to Oncor's digital backbone. And we have about $525 million allocated to that category. Fifth, improved physical security. Like all utilities, many around the country, we're facing additional intrusions and risk to our physical assets. And so we have about $80 million allocated in our plan to things such as -- video and event correlation systems to insist law enforcement as well as just general asset protective measures to try and better protect our assets and equipment. And we have about $80 million in that category.  Finally, we have about $900 million total in the plan, but about $182 million specifically related to wildfire mitigation measures. And that would include things like strengthening and protection of assets in higher-risk wildfire zones, safe device deployment, advanced wildfire risk modeling, overhead and underground resiliency measures and again, increased distribution, automation in higher wildfire risk areas. And I would say, just lastly on that last piece, that's a continuation of wildfire risk mitigation and prevention that we've had going on for a number of years. But with this additional $900-or-so million that we have allocated to this category in this plan, we think we can make some real headway on that issue as well as the other ones I described. Jeffery Martin : Allen, if you would, maybe as a follow-up, going to kind of the heart of Jeremy's question, I don't want to get in front of your regulator, but could you just kind of define the value proposition that you think that the plan will deliver? E. Nye: Well, sure, Jeff, and I think you said it very well. And I've said on prior calls, I view this and I think we view this as a historic opportunity to really directly take action on our system to the benefit of our customers in the ERCOT market. And I think each one of these categories would provide very specific benefits from resiliency to avoidance and prevention of wildfires to better reliability, all things that will benefit our customers very directly. Jeffery Martin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Maybe just can you just figure your thoughts on the pause on the FDA permit and how do you see that progressing? Jeffery Martin : Yes. Thank you for asking me that question, Durgesh. I think I would start by saying that 2 things come to mind. First is, we believe the permitting pause is temporary and that permits will be issued in the future. I mean, many of you followed the comments that were made at the CERAWeek. I think Secretary Granholm has repeatedly now said that she anticipates this issue will be in the rearview mirror at some point early next year.  Secondly, I would also remind folks that it only really impacts Port Arthur Phase 2. We already have existing Department of Energy non-FDA permits for Cameron Phase 1, which is in operations, ECA Phase 1, and Port Arthur Phase 1, both of which are in construction as well as Cameron Phase 2, ECA Phase 2, and Vista Pacifico. So this is really something that really impacts directly Port Arthur Phase 2, and we expect to work through that early next year. I would note that Justin's team continues to work diligently to advance Port Arthur Phase 2, which we continue to believe has tremendous commercial value.  But I also thought it might be helpful if I return to what we think are probably the most important points around our LNG strategy. We have quality LNG development projects, which obviously include the expansion of Port Arthur. They are geographically advantaged. There's no other developer out there that has the opportunity to directly access Asia and also dispatch into the Atlantic through the Gulf. The next 2 in the queue have the advantage of being brownfield sites. That's another economic advantage for us at Port Arthur Phase 2 as well as Cameron expansion.  And we're advancing these projects in a disciplined manner for the benefit of our shareholders. I would also note that they are effectively upside to our current $48 billion capital plan, and they are also upside to our long-term growth rate. Durgesh Chopra : Jeff, I appreciate all that color. And I think you did answer my question I was just going to ask you. If there is a time line that we should follow as you think about FID, whether it's Port Arthur Phase 2 or the Cameron expansion. Jeffery Martin : Sure. I would mention 2 things. One is we have guided our expected FID for Cameron expansion to the first half of 2025. We have not yet set an FID expectation for Port Arthur Phase 2. But I can assure you that Justin's team continues to make steady progress. I mean, as you go quarter-over-quarter, we are continuing to make progress and commercially developing both of those projects, and I think the momentum inside of our company continues to build on their overall success. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent quarter, guys. Jeffery Martin : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Wanted to just go back to the SRP filing. Really appreciate all the detail there so far. Just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about the timing and the cadence of that spend, assuming that the plan sort of goes into effect in the 2025 time frame. And then can you just remind us how procedurally you expect this to play out between now and year-end? Jeffery Martin : Yes. Let me start with the procedural point and then I'll pass it on to Allen to talk about how he expects that capital to go forward. Obviously, they've made the filing yesterday, which was contemplated in the legislative bill that passed last year. The commission has a statutory 180 days to review and approve the filing. So I think for now, we're expecting that to be in hand in the fourth quarter.  And then in terms of that rolling out, suspend over 3 years. And maybe, Allen, you can talk about it on a going-forward basis, how you think that capital would lay in, obviously subject to the commission's approval and the final number. E. Nye: Yes, you bet, Jeff. Pretty simply, it's basically 2025 through 2027 for those outlays and it's slightly backloaded. Carly Davenport : Got it, great. And then to follow up just on, you've talked a lot about these robust load growth opportunities in Texas supporting infrastructure investment. Just could you talk a little bit about if there's any sort of supply chain or other constraints that you're running into in terms of executing on that T&D build out at Oncor? Jeffery Martin : Yes. I said something about this in my prepared remarks. We continue to see some supply chain constraints in some areas, but in general, we're seeing obviously load growth across all of our markets and there's been some relaxation of the supply chain issue. I think Oncor in particular, and both Justin and I serve on their Board of Directors, have done a really good job of going into the marketplace to secure the appropriate contractors and hard goods. But Allen, perhaps you could talk about the work that the team has done. And over what period of time do you feel like you've got what you need locked in? E. Nye: Sure. Yes. Carly, it's a great question. Again, as Jeff said, we at Oncor and our operations and our supply chain people had been working to get in position to be able to execute on this plan for quite a while now. And we've done a number of things, including diversifying our supply chain, adding additional suppliers 5 and 6 years ago that have put us in a position now to while there certainly are issues out there with supply chain, we feel extremely confident in the first 2 years.  I've said it to my Board. I think we have the first 2 years effectively in the box with what we need from both an equipment perspective and from a vendor perspective. And we've made very significant progress on the outer 3 years as well. And what we're doing now is filling in the gaps and waiting to assign things out like engineering studies. Those aren't completed yet for the outer years because we wouldn't assign them out until we know exactly what we're facing. But we've managed, I believe, to work through supply chain issues very effectively, and we feel very good about where we are right now. Jeffery Martin : And then, Carly, the only other thing I would add to Allen's comments is think about his base capital plan, which is just over $24 billion, is really organized around growth. And specifically, it is weighted toward transmission. So roughly 60% of that spend is transmission. And I think that's why this SRP filing is so important. It really creates a second leg of growth specifically around building in redundancy and resiliency in the system, which is equally important to the state of Texas. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Steven Fleishman : Just one question. Just I think Conoco might have said they have interest in selling down a stake in Port Arthur, but I did not see it myself so I'd just be curious what you're hearing from them. Jeffery Martin : Yes, I'll make a couple of comments here. One is, Steve, Conoco is a very important strategic partner for us at Port Arthur. I would note that we've got a lot of respect for their management team and certainly have great relationships across both companies and I think a strong alignment of interest, and this is the key point around both Phase 1 and Phase 2.  So whether they elect to put new capital into Phase 2 is an open matter. I'd certainly refer that to their management team. But just remember, in the first phase, they took roughly half of the offtake or 5 million tonnes per annum, they own 30% of the project level equity, and they are also the gas manager for the first phase. The second phase is, important context, I believe, on Conoco because the second phase will be taking gas supply, Steve, from the Permian Basin, which has significant strategic considerations for a variety of commercial parties, and that's particularly true for ConocoPhillips. So I would just note that this is an area we're working closely with a variety of counterparties who want to collaborate with us on the success of Phase 2. And based on the conversations we're currently having, we continue to be very excited about moving forward with that project. Operator : And our next question will come from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : If I could, I guess, jump on Carly's question. I guess hers is more specific maybe supply chain to the regulated utility. If I think about the Infrastructure business, particularly with Port Arthur 2 and Cameron Phase 2, any big changes or estimates you're seeing in the E&C contracts that maybe Bechtel is looking into? Jeffery Martin : Yes. What might be helpful here, Anthony, is Justin, if you just take us through maybe a little bit of a construction update as well as what you're doing to secure some long lead time items on some of the projects to your near-term focused, and that might be helpful for his question. Justin Bird : Yes, yes. Hi, Anthony, and thank you, Jeff. Yes. So let me start with construction and then I'll go to the heart of your question. So we're seeing solid progress at construction at both ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur Phase 1. I've had opportunities to visit both sites recently. Jeff and I were at ECA just 2 weeks ago observing construction. And I was at Port Arthur recently for the 1-year commemorative groundbreaking. Both projects remain on track. We're not seeing the supply chain issues.  At ECA Phase 1, we remain on track for COD in the summer of 2025. We're now more than 80% complete. Construction is ongoing across all areas of the project. We have about 4,000 people deployed on-site and have over 15 million hours worked with no lost time incidents. Bechtel at Port Arthur Phase 1, construction activities are progressing well. As Karen mentioned in remarks, we're focused on the foundation stage construction, soil stabilization, piling, concrete pouring, and it's exciting to see we recently commenced structural steel.  In terms of our development projects, we remain excited about these projects. We're continuing to see strong market interest and do expect these projects to advance. In terms of construction contracts or progress at Port Arthur Phase 2, while we're awaiting our DOE non-FDA export permit, we're continuing to work with Bechtel on an EPC agreement that can optimize efficiencies with the Phase 1 construction schedule. We're also continuing marketing efforts for offtake and equity.  On Cameron Phase 2, we're currently working with the Cameron partners to optimize cost through value engineering. And as Jeff mentioned, we're also exploring the procurement or reservation of long lead time and critical path equipment. Cameron Phase 2 is a comparatively low emission project, and it's a brownfield asset sourcing low-cost gas. So we think this is really important. And as Jeff had previously mentioned, we're advancing that with a view toward taking FID in the first half of 2025.  I guess as a takeaway, I talk about the reverse Field of Dreams model when they come and when we achieve the right returns, we'll build it. Along these lines, we'll only move forward with our projects when we have the right cost and risk structure and long-term contracted cash flows that support our corporate strategy, our targeted mid-teen equity returns and create value for our shareholders. Jeffery Martin : Anthony, I'd also mention to the heart of your question, the Bechtel relationship is a strategic relationship for us. They're very, very helpful, kind of the best in the business in the [ Gulf ]. And that's why Justin commented on the importance of not demobilizing Phase 1 and going right into a continuous build into Phase 2 at Port Arthur. I would also note that his team has master purchase agreements with all the key vendors in place. And there's a lot of focus on making sure we're sourcing the key equipment and particularly planning in advance to long lead time items. So that all goes into the box of how we manage risk to make sure that we're delivering projects that create the right risk reward for our owners. Anthony Crowdell : And then if I get one follow-up, and I know it's a very small part of SIP. It's the Cimarr\u00f3n Wind. The company has been very successful at recycling capital and sold a renewable portfolio several years ago. Very opportunistic there. And now the company is -- should we think of more wins coming on or more renewable coming on to rebuilding a renewable portfolio with SIP? And I'll leave it there. Jeffery Martin : Yes, let me provide a little bit of context for that because we're excited about that project. Let me start, Anthony, with the fact that we rolled out our new corporate strategy back in 2018. And really, at the heart of that strategy was a more narrow focus on 2 things, the first of which was building leadership and scale advantages in large economic markets; and number two, more narrowly invested in the energy value chain around T&D type of infrastructure investments like Cimarr\u00f3n where we can produce highly recurring cash flows.  So when you turn that corporate strategy back to Mexico, we built a leadership position there going back to the 1990s. It's a market with over 130 million consumers. When I became CEO in 2018, Anthony, it was the 15th largest economy in the world. Today, the IMF has it ranked as the #12 economy in the world. And PricewaterhouseCoopers now forecasts it will be #7 in the world by 2040. It's also our largest trading partner with an energy network that's highly integrated with the United States. And that really plays to our strategy along the border and particularly the wind projects that you're referencing is located right along the U.S. border, is an expansion of a very large ESJ wind complex that we already own.  It's integrated electrically with a high-voltage system and does serve California and it's being built using SI's operating cash flows from Mexico. So I think the key point here is, and we've referenced it several times in our prepared remarks, there is a very strong built-in growth story at SI based upon projects that have already taken FID, and the opportunity with this land position we have adjacent to California is to efficiently and cost effectively build some additional solar and wind to serve the California market, which is integrated with Mexico and fill in and continue to improve on that recurring cash flow growth story that Justin has been talking about. Operator : And we have time for one more question. And our next question will come from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : I'd like to dovetail a little on Anthony's first question about labor and the LNG markets and kind of feed that into a broader question for Justin. In the last 2, 3 months, we've seen some peer projects announce potential delays, unskilled labor issues. For the same reasons, you've announced increasing demand in your domestic utility networks and T&D networks from data centers to AI, but also coal-to-gas fuel switching and other.  We've kind of seen a stabilization and rebound in the LNG markets with some sense that this digestion period everybody was looking for in the second half maybe soft and short or not exist at all. And in this context of the last 2, 3 months kind of change, I'm wondering if you're seeing any change in body language and a desire to kind of seize the day on prospective off-takers. Justin Bird : Yes, thanks for the question, Craig. I think you talked a little bit about supply chain, about labor, but let me go to the heart of your question at the end there. So I think the LNG pause, I would say, I think there was some time to react to that in the marketplace. You saw some people step back maybe with a little less desperation than they maybe had as part of the war in Ukraine. But I will say, and I think we've said it multiple times on this call, we are still seeing a robust commercial interest in our projects, our projects, our expansion opportunities. We've been a strong partner. So we're seeing robust interest. And I'd say currently, we have teams around the world actively engaged in commercial discussions for long-term contracted volumes. Jeffery Martin : I would also add, Craig, I appreciate your question. If it's all about seize the day, I'm betting on Justin's team. We're very excited about the progress we're making on the LNG front and look forward to providing updates in the future. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks. Jeffery Martin : Let me just start by thanking everyone for joining us today. I know there were competing calls this morning so we appreciate everyone making the time to join us. As Karen mentioned, we certainly believe we have a compelling value proposition with a strong growth and income story. Our management team is committed to the long-term success of Sempra, and we believe there's an incredible opportunity for us to continue innovating and finding new and better ways to serve customers while also delivering strong financial returns to our owners.  If there are any follow-up items, please reach out to our IR team with your questions, and we look forward to seeing you in California at AGA on May 20 and 21. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra's second quarter 2024 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Group President, Sempra California; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and other members of our senior management team. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. I'd also like to mention that forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today August 6, 2024, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. As we close out the first half of the year, we continue our focus on safety and operational excellence and we're pleased with the strength of our financial performance. This actually sets us up well in the second half of the year while also supporting our confidence in a projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. And more importantly, we think there's a lot to be excited about. At Sempra California, we continue to play a critical role in helping the state achieve its safety, reliability and decarbonization goals. That's why we continue to make important investments to improve safety, modernize the grid, and better support the delivery of cleaner forms of energy. We also look forward to advancing our general rate cases here in the state and anticipate a proposed decision later this summer with a final decision expected before the end of the year. The outcome of the GRC is expected to help our utilities better meet the state's public policy goals, advance reliability and community safety, and improve visibility to our plan of execution through 2027. At Sempra Texas, Oncor continues to see remarkable growth, and it's coming from a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, technology, and digital infrastructure. Annual premise growth, as one example, continues to trend around 2%, which is almost double the national average. Allen will walk through how electricity demand is impacting the Texas grid and also driving the need for new capital investments all across Oncor service territory. Against that backdrop, you recall that Oncor is currently executing on a record five-year capital plan of roughly $24 billion, with a pending regulatory filing to improve system resiliency by investing incremental capital of up to $3 billion from 2025 through 2027. With the remarkable growth in Oncor service territory, we continue to expect to see higher levels of capital spending in the future, and this will be a key consideration in our financial planning process this fall. Finally, Sempra Infrastructure remains focused on advancing critical infrastructure investments that support the energy transition and enhanced energy security, and we continue to see progress across several key development initiatives. Moving to our financial results for the quarter, earlier this morning, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.89 and year-to-date adjusted EPS of $2.24. As a reminder, these results do not reflect the impact of a final California GRC decision, which we expect before year-end with rates retroactively applied to January 1. From my perspective, we've had a great start to the first half of the year. As a result, we're affirming both our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range and our 2025 EPS guidance range. Please turn to the next slide. As a reminder, we view our corporate strategy as an opportunity to assert a competitive advantage in energy markets, and there are three key elements to our plan of execution. First, we've positioned our portfolio in some of the most attractive economic markets in North America. California and Texas, for example, give our utilities great exposure to increasing demand for new infrastructure investments, while Sempra Infrastructure benefits from strong tailwinds around the restoring of industry to North America and global demand for improved energy security associated with the export of liquefied natural gas from the United States. Second, we focused our investment strategy in a more narrow part of the energy value chain, namely transmission and distribution investments. By doing so, we aim to improve the quality and recurring nature of our earnings and cash flows while reducing exposure to risk and price volatility. We believe this provides an improved risk reward profile for our owners. And finally, we aggressively compete capital inside our company across all three growth platforms to help ensure we're delivering the best overall returns to our owners. At the end of the day, being good stewards of capital is a top priority and has allowed us to continue delivering attractive risk adjusted returns. As an example, we've been successful in delivering a 10% adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate since 2018. Next, I'll turn the call over to Allen to walk through the improving growth story that continues to unfold in Texas. Please turn to the next slide. Allen Nye : Thank you, Jeff. I'd like to start by saying that growth continues at a rapid pace all across the state of Texas, and especially in the Oncor service territory. In the second quarter alone, we built, rebuilt or upgraded approximately 1,050 miles of T&D lines, increased our premise count by approximately 20,000, and received approximately 100 new transmission POI requests, which has increased our active interconnection requests in our queue by 13% year-over-year. It's also important to note that we continue to make progress on the five-year capital plan that was announced earlier this year of approximately $24 billion. As Jeff mentioned, this does not include the capital expenditures that may be approved as part of our system resiliency plan, or SRP. We filed our first SRP with the PUCT in May of this year. Turning to our operating environment. Texas like the nation as a whole is seeing an increase in the frequency and intensity of severe weather events. The number of extreme storms, including ice, intense heat, and extremely high winds have shown us that we must be even more focused on reliability, resiliency, and response. That's why our SRP identifies seven measures with detailed programs and activities for each measure to address the wide range of resiliency events we're seeing across our service territory, including extreme weather, the risk of wildfires, physical security threats, and cybersecurity threats. Along with the hardening of our system to prevent outages, our proposed initiatives include a substantial opportunity to expand distribution automation to the legacy portions of our system. We call this our flexible and self-healing distribution grid measure. Today, newer facilities on our system have this technology, which allows us to automatically redistribute load to undamaged parts of our grid during extreme weather or other events, significantly reducing or in some cases eliminating lengthy outages for many of our customers. We recently provided some examples to the PUCT of how this technology helped hundreds of our customers avoid what could have been daylong outages from the severe storms we experienced in May. Among other areas, our SRP also proposes retrofitting older portions of our system with this technology. Additionally, we have proposed expanding our vegetation management programs by approximately $90 million per year, including further use of remote sensing and other new technologies to better target fast growing vegetation. This expansion is expected to more than double our distribution vegetation management efforts. These investments, together with the SRP measures that specifically target wildfire risk, will also accelerate our work to help comprehensively address wildfire mitigation. These efforts will continue to build on our collaborations with the Texas A&M Forest Service and our counterparts at San Diego Gas & Electric, both of whom are globally recognized as subject matter experts with significant experience in wildfire mitigation and response. It's also noteworthy that our SRP filing is not the only action we're taking to improve our resiliency and preparation for extreme weather events. Over a 21-day period in the months of May and June, tornadoes touched down in the Temple, Killeen area, a storm with straight line winds measuring as high as 95 miles per hour passed through the DFW Metroplex, and additional storms impacted our East Texas region. I want to thank the 12,000 Oncor employees, contractors and off system personnel who worked around the clock restoring service to our customers as soon as safely possible. Recently, we also sent 500 mutual assistance workers to the Gulf Coast to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Beryl. These storms have shown that our industry must continue to improve our plans for prevention, response and communication so that we are meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations for the safe and reliable delivery of electricity, and I can assure you that it's a top priority for our team. At Oncor, we are dedicated to being a safe and reliable operator and helping ensure a resilient grid, which is even more critical given the amount of growth we're seeing in Texas. Please turn to the next slide. Interconnection requests from large C&I customers and the additional transmission expansion needed to bring power to these high demand customers are the primary drivers of the growth in our capital plan. Under our current capital plan, Oncor's rate base is anticipated to grow at an average annual rate of 11% from 2023 through 2028. To help meet the scale of these new investments, we've taken important steps to diversify our supplier base, enter into multi-year agreements, ordered various critical inventory in advance, and have begun procuring necessary equipment with significant investments in warehousing and lay down yards to support the timely rollout of our capital investments. We also see opportunities for significant future growth in our service territory. As announced earlier this year, ERCOT projects peak load in 2030 to be 152 gigawatts nearly double the current record of 85.5 gigawatts set in August 2023. Based on our current share of ERCOT load and our internal projections, we expect approximately 40% of that future load to be served by Oncor. Included in ERCOT's load growth projections are the continued electrification efforts in the Permian Basin. In response to House Bill 5066 passed in the 2023 legislative session to address this growth, ERCOT filed a plan with the PUCT in late July that identifies new transmission investments of $13 billion to $15 billion by 2038. Given the scope of our operations in the region, we expect to build a significant portion of the projects that are ultimately approved in the Permian plan. As Jeff noted, there is a likelihood of higher capital spending in the future and we continue to review our forecast for future capital expenditures and expect to provide an update on the Q4 earnings call after our SRP filing is finalized by the PUCT and our analysis is complete and reviewed by Oncor's Board. I would conclude by saying that we are all really excited about the opportunity set in Texas and will remain relentless in our efforts to provide reliable, affordable electric service to our customers while maintaining a sharp focus on the safety of everyone who works on our system. Please turn to the next slide where Karen will walk through Sempra California's business update. Karen Sedgwick : Thank you, Allen. Sempra California is strategically positioned the largest economy in the U.S. and benefits from constructive regulation that supports investment opportunities to decarbonize and improve the safety and resiliency of the grid, forward-looking rate cases, cost of capital adjustment mechanism and an established wildfire fund that backstops the financial strength of the state's utilities. At SoCalGas, we're participating in several decarbonization initiatives that support California's statewide goals. Recently ARCHES of which SoCalGas is a partner became the country's first hydrogen hub to sign with the DOE to secure its funding. ARCHES forecasts California will need 17 million tonnes per year of hydrogen to help meet the state's 2045 climate goals. These cleaner molecules are expected to play a pivotal role in helping Los Angeles, one of the nation's largest manufacturing hubs lower its emissions and heavy-duty transportation and other hard-to-electrify sectors. That's why SoCalGas has proposed Angeles Link will form a key component in California's regional hydrogen hub. Turning to SDG&E. Community safety continues to be our number one priority. Over the last two decades, we've made significant investments in wildfire mitigation and hardened 100% of the transmission lines in our Tier 3 high fire-threat districts. We've proactively taken steps to further strengthen our predictive tools, training and resources by making significant upgrades to SDG&E's wildfire and climate resiliency center. I recently had a chance to visit the state-of-the-art facility, and it's impressive. I invite you to come and see the facility if you can. Substantial innovative features of the facility include AI-enabled solutions, high-resolution cameras, enhanced drone data and line conductor fault detection. This facility is one of the most technologically advanced of its kind anywhere in America, and played a central role in helping to ensure SDG&E is prepared for and actively mitigating risks related to its operating environment. This is all part of a larger effort at SDG&E to meet the state's public policy goals while building out a climate-resilient energy grid. Now moving to our regulatory updates of California Utilities. In June, SDG&E delivered a notice of termination to FERC of its fifth transmission owner formula rate mechanism or TO5 and is preparing its TO6 filing. We expect SDG&E to make a submission in the fourth quarter with an effective date in 2025. In our filing, we anticipate updating our formulaic rate and making a constructive case for competitive ROE, reflecting today's market conditions. Lastly, on the California GRC, we expect to propose decision later this summer and a final decision by year-end. As a reminder, the final decision will be retroactive to the beginning of this year. Please turn to the next slide. Sempra Infrastructure's long-term strategy is focused on capitalizing on the growing demand for cleaner and more secure energy. Wood Mackenzie estimates that global LNG demand will grow nearly 70% and reach more than 700 million tonnes per year by 2050. Our development pipeline is making significant strides to help meet those needs. At ECA LNG Phase 1, we are roughly 85% complete. However, our contractor has experienced labor retention and productivity issues in recent months. As a result, our commercial operations date will be delayed until the spring of 2026. We are actively engaged with our contractor to advance the project, and we'll see increased capital expenditures for the project in the form of additional carrying costs and lower estimated commissioning revenues, which are based on forward price curves. Despite the delay of potential changes in capital, we still expect to maintain strong integrated financial returns, consistent with our original forecast at the time that we took FID in 2020. This is the result of a combination of factors, including optimization opportunities, stronger LNG demand over the long-term and inflation protection within the SPAs. Moving to Port Arthur LNG, we're making steady progress on Phase I. And we remain on budget and schedule. We recently received FERC authorization for 24/7 construction, which is expected to improve the overall efficiency of the construction activities. At Cameron Phase 2, we continue to work with our partners to enhance cost efficiency through value engineering. Finally, we've begun construction on Cimarron Wind, the 320-megawatt project and expect to reach commercial operations in the first half of 2026. Our experience in Mexico demonstrates our ability to work well with both regulators and legislators, and we look forward to supporting their increasing energy needs as industrial reshoring continues to drive economic expansion. Please turn to the next slide for an update on progress at Port Arthur Phase 2. We're very excited about some of the recent developments at Port Arthur LNG Phase 2. Earlier this summer, we executed an HoA with Aramco for 5 million tonnes per annum of off-take capacity and 25% interest in the project level equity. Last month, we also executed a fixed price contract with Bechtel. This contract provides an opportunity to continue our partnership with a world-class EPC firm while also benefiting from continuous construction. In combination with the common facilities that are being constructed as part of Phase I, we expect to generate robust investment returns on the overall Port Arthur Energy Hub. We are working with all stakeholders to advance this project, which has received all material permits with the exception of the DOE non-FTA export permit that is pending approval. However, we do not anticipate the DOE pause will impact our development time line. As a reminder, Phase 2 at Port Arthur and all other projects that have not reached FID represent upside to our existing capital plan. Please turn to the next slide where I'll walk through Sempra's financials. Earlier this morning, Sempra reported second quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $713 million or $1.12 per share. This compares to second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $603 million or $0.95 per share. On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2024 earnings were $567 million or $0.89 per share. This compares to our second quarter 2023 earnings of $594 million or $0.94 per share. The key takeaway is that we're pleased with our financial results. For the first six months of the year, we're trending above our financial forecasts and are well-positioned to deliver another strong year of financial performance. Please turn to the next slide. Variances in the second quarter 2024 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized as follows : At Sempra California, we had $26 million primarily from higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, including higher authorized cost of capital. This was more than offset by $49 million, primarily from lower income tax benefits, lower regulatory awards and higher net interest expense. As a reminder, because our GRC is still pending, our CPUC-authorized base revenues in second quarter 2024 are based on 2023 authorized levels. This is important because any true-up later this year will be retroactively applied to January 1 once the final decision is approved. Turning to Sempra Texas, we had $42 million of higher equity earnings attributable to rate updates, increased invested capital and consumption, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses. At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $48 million of lower equity earnings and revenues in the transportation business, including the cumulative impact of new tariffs in Mexico in the prior year and $8 million of higher income tax expense, higher O&M and lower revenues, partially offset by lower net interest expense. At Sempra Parent, the $10 million net change is primarily due to lower taxes from the interim period application of an annual forecasted consolidated effective tax rate, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Please turn to the next slide. To wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to reiterate a couple of the key points that help drive the overall success of our corporate strategy. As energy needs to grow and evolve in North America, our unwavering commitment to safety and operational excellence support our delivery of safer, more reliable, and resilient energy and our position as a leader in some of North America's largest economic markets, offers investors visibility to our future growth as we look to invest higher levels of capital in critical new energy infrastructure through the end of the decade and beyond. To conclude, this is an exciting time for our company, and we look forward to continuing to deliver strong financial and operational results. Thank you for joining us, and I'd now like to open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the prepared remarks. We'll now open the line to your questions. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, Jeff. How are you doing? Jeff Martin : I'm doing great. Thank you. Shar Pourreza : Excellent. So just, Jeff, on the ECA COD delays, I know you'll be looking at sort of firming up the 2025 guidance, later from a timing perspective. But I guess, how are you thinking about offsets as we roll forward into next year? Can you kind of mitigate the project delay? Or should we assume some level of timing drag? I know obviously, you reiterated guidance today, but there's also a perception that the 2025 guide is somewhat conservative. So just how do we think about the moving pieces? Thanks. Jeff Martin : Yes. Thank you, Shar, for asking that question. I'll start by talking about the change in schedule and I'll move to the 2025 guidance. I would start by saying that we're disappointed in the change of schedule at ECA as has been our practice. When we work with our contractors, we expect our projects to be built on time and on budget. That is the standard at Sempra. And in this case, that standard has not been met, but I'm confident that Justin and his team will get it corrected. Here's what's important going to the heart of your question. We target mid-teen equity returns across the portfolio at Sempra Infrastructure. And as we've updated our forecast, we continue to believe that ECA remains in line with those original targets. We've made financial commitments, as you know, to our owners in the form of published EPS guidance ranges for both 2024 and 2025, and we've been confident in reconfirming those ranges this morning. I would note that we have plenty of opportunities to both grow and reduce costs where it makes sense, and we'll continue to work hard to exceed people's expectations regarding the performance of our business. I'd also like to turn this over to Karen to talk a little bit about 2025, if you could, Karen. Karen Sedgwick : Sure. As Jeff mentioned, we have a diverse portfolio with many levers to meet our guidance. So with the scheduled change at ECA, we're taking several steps to ensure we deliver on our financial commitment. SI this includes asset optimization, such as utilizing our available pipeline capacity, in addition to driving some operational efficiencies in the business. We continue to see significant growth across our utility platforms. For example, Allen's business updates on today's call points to incremental opportunities at Sempra Texas that we expect to benefit us next year and across our planning period. And then across the enterprise, we're always focused on creating efficiencies and increasing productivity, so we'll continue this process and look forward to refreshing our plan later this fall and provide updates on our fourth quarter call. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then just on the GRC outcome, I mean, CPUC has been a bit slower kind of acting on things recently with various kind of proceedings, I guess, how are you thinking about a timely outcome in 2024 on the GRC? And if kind of like a final vote is delayed, let's say, into the latter part of the year or even 2025. How do we sort of think about the cadence of that financial update you just brought up for 2025. So do you need to wait for an order in the PD? Or is the PD sufficient enough to firm up 2025? Thanks. Jeff Martin : Yes, I'll give you a couple of thoughts on this is, obviously, the California Public Utility Commission has had a very busy docket, particularly over the last 12 months. So we understand kind of the timing of our rate case has been delayed into this year. What I would make a couple of points on Shar is that we put together, what I think is a very strong GRC filing for both San Diego Gas Electric and SoCalGas. And the reason we have some level of confidence is both of those filings are strongly in line with the state's key priorities, which you'll recall is around safety and specifically community safety, reliability and clean energy. I would also note as a reminder that last fall, we reached a settlement on roughly one-third of the rate cases for each of those businesses with a subset of interveners, and we look forward to receiving proposed decision later this summer with a final decision expected before the end of the year. So I think we still have very high confidence that the rate case we voted out this year. And I would remind our listening audience that our rates would be retroactively effective to January 1 of 2024. And then to the larger point, I will conclude by saying, we have a very strong track record of working with our regulators and stakeholders to get to good outcomes. I think we're comfortable that we'll be able to give a strong update in terms of our forward guidance including our capital plan on our Q4 call. And hopefully, we'll be able to give more visibility on our Q3 call to potential changes in our capital plan. Shar Pourreza : Okay. That's actually perfect. Jeff. Thank you so much. Appreciate the additional color. See you soon. Jeff Martin : Thank you for joining our call, Shar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Jeff Martin : Good morning, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. Hey just picking up on the ECA discussion. I think the initial estimates of costs were around $2.5 billion and you mentioned some construction delays, obviously. Just how does that number sort of the overall project cost tracking versus $2.5 billion, if you could share any color there? Jeff Martin : Sure. I'll provide some returns on the changes in capital. And maybe it might be helpful, Justin, if we just provide a little bit more color around the schedule at ECA for our listening audience. The first thing I've mentioned, Durgesh is, as a result of the schedule change, we're expecting that the estimated increase in capital for Sempra's net share to be about $300 million. Karen referenced this earlier, but we still expect to maintain our targeted levered returns in the mid-teens for the overall integrated project. And as you know, that certainly includes continuing to optimize our transportation position. You'll recall, too, that with the change in schedule, it provides us opportunities to continue to manage that transportation position. For those of you who are hearing about our transportation, recall that we've got positions that connect us to the producing regions both in Texas and New Mexico and allow us to serve what has increasingly been a constrained market in the western part of the United States, including Baja California, where we've seen natural gas demand increase by over 30% in the last 10 years. One other thing that's benefited us at the project, Durgesh is we have certain inflation protections in our SPAs and that's also been helpful in helping us meet our expected original returns. So I think the key takeaway from my perspective is, we're in a good position to continue to manage that project. Deliberate consistent with the new expectations in the spring of 2026 and also meet our targeted financial returns. Durgesh Chopra : That's great helpful. Thank you. Jeff Martin : Yes. And I'll let Justin go and speak to some of the additional color on the change in schedule. Justin Bird : Hi Durgesh, first, let me say, like, Jeff, I'm disappointed with the schedule change at ECA. I will also say, given our ongoing efforts, I am confident that, one, will reach commercial operations in the spring of 2026; and two, will meet our return expectations at ECA. Let me give you just a little bit of color on where we are. The project is roughly 85% complete. Steel construction has been completed; piping is in full swing, 65% complete. We pulled roughly 87 miles of cable and 95% of the main equipment has been received on site and nearly 80% of that equipment has been delivered. The critical issue has been that during our peak in the work cycle, given some of the craft labor constraints in Baja, our contractor was unable to retain and secure the necessary labor resources to meet the schedule, and this loss of labor has created a change in schedule. Big picture, I still view this as an opportunity to showcase our ability to work constructively with our partners and contractors to safely deliver a quality project in the spring of 2026 with strong returns over the long-term. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Justin. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you, both. That is very clear. Just shifting gears over to Texas. Good to see that you have a settlement in the system resiliency plan. I'm just wondering, if there is any backlash, whether it's from the PUC or other stakeholders given sort of just what we've seen in media in response to the hurricane. Just any thoughts there? Just thinking about risks to your potential settlement here. Jeff Martin : Yes. I would just make a couple of comments here. Number one, I think the timing of this agreement in principle, which is an all-party settlement. It's very, very good. I think as we think about our industry, generally, Durgesh, we're continuing to see extreme weather conditions, and it's highlighting the importance not just in Texas but California and other jurisdictions have continued to invest in resiliency. At our company, we've got over a 100-year history of dealing with these types of events. And I think we're pleased by Oncor's recent storm response. If you followed Oncor back in May, they went through some very severe weather and did a great job of restoring their system. So I think the opportunity for us is to marry up the commitment to operational excellence and storm response that Oncor has built a reputation on with this forward-looking SRP program. And the good news is, as it's been crafted as a settlement in principle, those dollars will start to flow in Q4 of this year and allows us to get after continuing to harden that system. So I think it's the right outcome at the right time for the customers of Oncor. Durgesh Chopra : Perfect. Thank you for taking my questions. Jeff Martin : No worries. Thank you, Durgesh. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Your line is open. Jeff Martin : Hey Julien, we want to welcome you back. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, thank you so much, Jeff team, it's a pleasure to chat with you guys. So you guys continue to make great progress across the Board, including here in Texas. So to that end, right, with this SRP, let me, if I can ask to sort of elaborate a little bit, how do you think about the SRP in light of what's happened with Beryl and perhaps any expansion plans around mobile gen or otherwise, right? So it an ever-evolving landscape here, the needs are evolving. Obviously, this was contemplated in the last legislative session. Any comments about how to move from here on expanding the SRP and/or expectations on the legislative session next year ahead that could come ahead. Jeff Martin : Yes. Let me do a couple of things. Let me start with my views on the SRP. I'll pass it to Allen to talk about some next steps procedural. But Julien, I'll start right up in front and say, I have been around the utility business for roughly 30 years, going back to 1992. And in my career, I've never seen an evolving growth story like we see in Texas. So we made a great investment, as you know, back in March of 2018, we were investing in what was at that time an 80% owner that had been bankrupt. We thought there was an opportunity to deploy capital in a way that better serve customers. So I think we are investing in a management team and a growth story, and it certainly has played out very well. And I will tell you that story continues to evolve, and I'm more bullish today than I've been at any point on the capital opportunity in Texas. Let's talk about this our PO quickly. You recall that the Oncor team filed that case back in May it outlined nearly $3 billion of capital investments. And you'll recall that, that's incremental to the record campaign that they're executing on right now, which comes in right around $24 billion. As we updated on the call, we're pleased that Oncor has been successful in reaching a preliminary settlement as an all-party settlement, and we view the settlement in principle constructively and hope to move to a final settlement in the coming weeks. I would want to have a note of caution here that we don't want to speak to the details of the settlement nor Julien, do you understand, we don't want to front run the commission's review. But we feel very positive about it. I think it's a great sign for our ability to step forward and continue to help rate payers in Texas. And Allen, maybe it would be helpful for Julien, if you talked a little bit about kind of the procedural next steps. Allen Nye : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, Julien. As Jeff said, we're really, really excited about announcing the settlement in principle of our SRP this morning. And I do want to thank the parties; in particular PUC staff for the willingness to work with us on getting to this outcome that we think is really going to provide some meaningful benefits to our customers. But with regards to the next steps, now that we've announced that we filed with the PUC and informed the judge of our preliminary settlement. We're in the process of drafting a definitive settlement agreement plus supporting testimony. We're going to file that by August 16. And at that time, the details will be public, and we can talk more about it. Next step would be to have the case remanded from State Office of Administrative Hearings back to the PUC and to try and get that scheduled for PUC consideration as soon as reasonably possible. And as Jeff said, I never like to get in front of the commission or assume anything. But assuming that we get approval, we think we'll be in a position to begin making the SRP-related investments and expenditures late in this year in 2024. I think importantly, we believe that this settlement will allow us to accomplish all of the benefits that we identified in our original filing. And given some of the challenges that our state has faced over the last few months, we think this is a really very positive development for both us and our customers. Jeff Martin : The only other thing I would add, Julien, to the back part of your question is, later this week, I'll be meeting with the Governor of Louisiana in Louisiana and then on Friday, I'll be meeting with Governor Abbott. And part of the purpose of my business is to continue to reiterate Sempra's strong commitment to invest in the state of Texas. And I think we might be the largest investor in the state today in addition to the $27 billion of spending we've circled at Oncor, we're putting into work $13 billion at Port Arthur Phase I and we're aggressively looking to put forward a similar project of scale for Port Arthur Phase 2. As you think about the legislative session for next year, my personal view, Julien, is that public policy in the state of Texas favors new investment around reliability and resilient infrastructure. And I would tell you that's right in Oncor's wheelhouse. So we'll continue to expect constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes in Texas. And I think you've seen that, Julien, over the last year or two, and we're committed to partnering with stakeholders to continue to achieve outcomes that directly support our customers in North Texas. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you guys so much for the details. And just quickly, on the SIP front, obviously, you saw the ECA developments here. Just to confirm here, that doesn't have any reads here or concerns for PA with respect to the on-time, on-budget conversation. And then subsequently to your prospects for PA Phase 2, as you think about like that continuous construction mantra that I think you've previously articulated here and expectation for cost. Jeff Martin : Yes. There's actually two questions there. I think let me speak to the read through to Port Arthur first. And then Justin, I think it would be really helpful to talk about your excitement on Port Arthur Phase 2. So really quickly, a short answer to your question is Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 is not impacted, Julien, you know this, it's a different market. It's a different craft labor pool, it's a fully wrapped EPC contract with what we think is the best EPC contractor in the business, which is Bechtel. So I think that's one of the things that we're not as concerned about. What we encountered in ECA was unique to the craft market in Baja California. We feel very good about Port Arthur Phase I. But Justin, I think it would be helpful to Julien if you don't mind walking through where you're at on Phase 2. Justin Bird : Absolutely. Hi Julien, as Karen mentioned in her prepared remarks, we've had a number of exciting announcements recently. As you referenced, we executed a fixed price EPC agreement with Bechtel. Bechtel is doing incremental pre-FID work, and we're excited to move this project forward while targeting cost and construction efficiencies by have them roll uninterrupted from Phase 1 to Phase 2. Secondly, we announced the execution of an HoA with Saudi Aramco for 25% of the project equity and 5 million tonnes per annum of off-take. This demonstrates the global demand for LNG out of Port Arthur and more broadly, the value of low-cost and secure U.S. LNG. I might add that commercial discussions are progressing very well and there is a reasonable likelihood that the remainder of our volume is under similar HoA-type agreements in the coming months. And I hope we will have -- be in a position to provide continued positive progress on our third quarter call. From a permitting perspective, we've already received our FERC permit and FTA export, and we're now awaiting the non-FTA export permit which, again, we do not expect to impact our FID decision timing. And as a reminder, with Sempra's planning convention, since Port Arthur 2 is not -- has not reached a positive FID, it is not included in our plan and represents significant new growth opportunities. Julien, we can't be more excited about what we're seeing at Port Arthur Phase 2. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great stuff, guys. We'll see you soon here. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Carly Davenport : Hey, thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to ask just on a couple of points on Texas. So I appreciate the updates on the growth outlook there. Wanted to ask on the $13 billion to $15 billion of transmission CapEx that you referenced that was proposed by ERCOT in the Permian. Could you help us think about how large of a share of that spend Oncor could help execute on as we think about that timeframe? Jeff Martin : Thank you, Carly. I think it would be helpful, Allen, to answer that question directly and then go back. I think you've got some additional color on overall growth in the state, but maybe to tackle the Permian plan first and then talk about the broader opportunity. Allen Nye : Yes, you bet. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, Carly. So the Permian plan is presently being discussed in Austin, plan was issued, the PUC's published questions. The answer is due, I believe, on Friday. There may be more rounds of questions. I anticipate there'll be a workshop. And then the goal is to get something issued in the next couple of months, maybe September. The only thing I can really tell you right now about what we would potentially be building out of that plant until the plan is finalized is when you look at the scope of our operations, and I often talk about, when I'm talking about overall growth on our system, what's happening in West Texas and our Stanton Loop and our Culberson Loop. Given the scope of our operations in those areas, the amount of substations or end points that we own that could be utilized under a 1938 analysis that we would anticipate on really any plan coming out of this process that we would be a heavy participant in that $13 billion to $15 billion depending on where it comes out. That's probably the best I can do on specifics on the Permian today. Jeff, you want to talk about growth overall. Just going back, and I know some of this is already out there is in our earnings release. And -- but I generally report on kind of the same categories every quarter, and I'm going to try and break it down into four categories this time. And Jeff has already mentioned, we've talked about our very strong premise growth that continues 20,000 new in the second quarter, still seeing about 2% annually about twice national average. The second category of transmission points of interconnection, new requests for the quarter, we had 80 -- I'm sorry, 98 new. That's up about 7% over the same quarter last year. Total requests are up 13%, and then we always break those down into generation and LC&I, generation is up 7.5%. The retail or the LC&I is up 22%. And as I mentioned last time, and I've got a little update here, about 25% of that total, which is 341 requests right now, our large load customers that -- for us, that's over 100 megawatts individually. That group presently represents approximately 80 gigawatts of potential load, of which about 74% or 59 gigawatts would come from potential data centers, but the rest of it is fairly diverse from the type of customers. So incredibly strong growth transmission POI on the LC&I or large customer perspective. I mentioned West Texas earlier strong growth continues there, Far West, Texas, weather zone. Peak is up 9.3% over the 2023 peak already this year. Culberson and Stanton, our two loops, transmission loops that we serve, the Permian and Delaware Basins. Culberson is up 15.5% over the 2023 peak. Stanton is up 1.3% over the 2023 peak so far this year. And then the fourth category, I mentioned in my opening remarks, but I think they're significant when you consider what we're facing and the opportunities that we're seeing on our system, the new ERCOT study, the load forecast coming out of HB 5066, indicating a peak demand of approximately 152 gigawatts by 2030, up from the 2011 gigawatts that they predicted through 2029. And as I've said before, we believe we anticipate, based on our analysis that around 40% of that load could be in our service territory. And then the Permian Basin study that we started with, as I said, $13 billion to $15 billion by 2038 given where our facilities are and how that analysis should work, we would expect to build a significant portion of whatever projects come out of that plan. So obviously, all that comes with CapEx. Jeff's already indicated how we're going to approach that, probably giving an update in Q4. But I think the significant part of our CapEx, if you look at our $24.2 billion plan, over the next five, which, as I've said before, approximately 70% is growth and 97% or so is recoverable through our trackers. That's all before the SRP, which we've announced for settlement and principal on today, which is approximately $3 billion, again, details to come in August 16 approximately. That's also before much of the investment that we would need to do in order to serve these large load customers that I just mentioned. That is before what we would get out of any Permian plan. And that is mostly before what we would need to spend to meet the revised ERCOT load forecast of 157 gigawatts by 2030. So we'll continue to analyze that. We're going to work with our shareholders and our Board like we always do and provide that update on the Q4 call. But we are very, very excited about what we're seeing on our system. We think there's tremendous opportunities to invest throughout our system, and we're looking forward to trying to meet those needs. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Allen. And Carly, the other point I mentioned, and Allen called this out is that roughly 80% of that capital program is serving growth. And that's important because it puts downward pressure on rate increases related to infrastructure investment. And secondly, which is really almost unheard of in our industry, roughly 60% of that capital plan is associated with transmission. So just like in California, where we have the TAC, where transmission costs are socialized across all state consumers. The same thing takes place in Texas. So it's a robust capital plan is the plan that's expected to continue to increase. And the good news is, it's directly serving growth without a lot of pressure on affordability and really serving the needs of Texas consumers. Carly Davenport : That's great. Thank you so much for all that context. Maybe just sticking in Texas for one follow-up. I guess how are you thinking about timing for going back in for another rate case. Just as you think about recent rate cases in Texas CapEx updates, moving pieces on insurance, a lot of things going on. So I'd just love to get your updated thoughts there. Jeff Martin : Yes. There are some moving pieces. I'll see if Allen wants to add anything to this, one of them is, for example, increase in insurance related to wildfire towers, which I think is a common issue across the state. This is something we continue to evaluate. The good news is we've got the opportunity to either file for some of these selective cost increases on a one-off basis or come back in for a rate case. I think Allen's team hasn't made a definitive decision on that. But Allen, if you'd like to add anything, please. please go ahead. Allen Nye : Yes. You bet, Jeff. Just briefly, we do -- we evaluate with our Board annually things like the topics you mentioned that might put pressures on us. But we are not required to come back in until the summer of 2027. We'll continue going through this process with our Board. And if things change, we'll make a decision. But right now, we don't have to -- we are not required to come back in until the summer of 2027. Carly Davenport : Great. Thanks you so much for all the comments and color. Jeff Martin : Thanks a lot, Carly for joining the call. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Martin for closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Yes, I'd like to conclude, if I could, by recapping several highlights from today's call. Number one, I think it's important for our listing audience to know and understand that we're seeing increased opportunity for investment in Texas. I think Allen did a good job of outlining some of the growth drivers there. I also want to state, I think it's the leading growth story in our sector and we continue to be very bullish on our opportunities in Texas. Number two, we're very pleased with our strong financial performance for the first half of the year. Karen mentioned this earlier, but we're trending ahead of our internal planning forecast. And number three, with Trevor's leadership and Scott Drury and Caroline Winn, we continue to feel quite positive about the opportunity we have in front of us with the general rate cases here in California because we're continuing to make investments, I think, that are strongly aligned with the public policy mandates of the state. In combination, we have great confidence in our financial commitments and are reconfirming our guidance ranges for both 2024 and 2025 as well as our long-term growth rate of 6% to 8%. It continues to be an exciting time for our company. And if you have any questions or follow-ups from this call today, please reach out to our IR team. I would also note that we look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming Citi and UBS conferences in the next few weeks. And for those of you who are interested, we also invite you to reach out and schedule time to come visit SDG&E's new wildfire and climate resiliency facility. I think you'll find it to be time well spent and come away with a very strong sense of our company's commitment to safety and operational excellence. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead. Glen Donovan : Good morning, and welcome to Sempra's third quarter 2024 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Caroline Winn, Chief Executive Officer of SDG&E Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and other members of our senior management team. Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. I'd also like to mention that forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, November 6, 2024, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Martin : Thank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. At Sempra, we believe the growth narrative for energy infrastructure continues to strengthen. With economic expansion and rising electricity demand, the United States is at a critical juncture where expanded investment is needed to upgrade and modernize its synergy networks. Nationally, we face mounting challenges in the form of aging infrastructure, extreme weather events and increased demands being placed on finite dispatchable generation resources. These trends confirm a growing need for new infrastructure investments to improve the resiliency of our energy networks, while at the same time extending the grid to new and diverse sources of energy. Consider that by 2030, the United States will need to have invested over $600 billion in transmission and distribution and that forecast will likely prove conservative due to a series of sector tailwinds. Here's an example. Today, Texas is the eighth largest economy in the world and accounts for the highest level of both consumption and production of energy in the U.S. The International Energy Agency is now estimating that by 2026, global AI and data centers will require nearly twice the amount of electricity that the State of Texas currently consumes each year. So demand from digital infrastructure is another important growth driver for our sector. It also flags what I believe is an underappreciated investment thesis at Sempra. Here, we believe the best low risk and high growth play on AI is high voltage transmission. Allen will discuss this later in today's call, but there's a significant queue of over 350 gigawatts of generation and storage waiting to come on the grid in Texas. The critical success factor there is the speed at which companies like Oncor can build, modernize and extend the high voltage transmission grid. That's exactly why the Texas Legislature passed a bill last session to shorten the permitting timeline for new transmission investments. Not only is Oncor expected to build more high voltage transmission this decade than any other company in America, Oncor's regulated transmission investments officially go into rates with tracker filings being made twice annually. So the key takeaway for our industry is with economic expansion and higher expected demand growth, it's reasonable to believe that sector EPS growth will trend higher than historical norms. From my perspective to outperform the peer group in this environment, it requires four key advantages. Number one, a clear and executable corporate strategy. Number two, exposure to sustained growth in large economic markets with constructive regulation. Number three, economies of scale and operations, technology and access to capital and number four, a strong track record of disciplined capital allocation. That's why in this higher growth environment, Sempra is well positioned to outperform its peer group. We have the leading utility platforms in the two largest economies in the United States, both Texas and California. And we also own an infrastructure business with scale that invest in projects providing secure and cleaner forms of energy, targeting higher equity returns in our utilities and contributing important cash flows that support our balance sheet and capital campaign. Currently, we're in the middle of our fall planning process and one of the early takeaways from network is we have improved visibility to a growing portfolio of investment opportunities. Next, turning to our financial results. I'm pleased with the progress the company has made in the third quarter and throughout the year as we continue to wait a final GRC decision in California. Earlier this morning, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.89 for the third quarter and year-to-date adjusted EPS of $3.12. As a reminder, these results do not yet reflect the California GRC proposed decision, which is pending before the commission. Assuming the final decision is received before year end, the earnings impacts will be applied retroactively to the beginning of 2024. As a result, we're affirming our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range, 2025 EPS guidance range and projected long-term EPS growth rate. Next, I'll turn the call over to Allen Nye, who will take us through recent developments at Oncor, which I continue to believe has the best growth story in our industry. Please turn to the next slide. Allen Nye : Thank you, Jeff. I'm excited to share another update on the remarkable growth opportunities we have at Oncor. To start with, EIA's latest short-term energy outlook forecasts 5% load growth between 2024 and 2025 across all ERCOT customers. And longer term, ERCOT expects power demand in Texas to grow by 80% through 2030 from the recent peak demand record of approximately 85 gigawatts. Moving to our operational achievements. In the third quarter, Oncor built, rebuilt or upgraded over 800 miles of T&D lines, increased our premise count by approximately 19,000 and received a 50% increase in new large C&I POI requests. Turning to the $24 billion five-year capital plan that we announced earlier this year, we continue to see a growing portfolio of new investment opportunities. As you'll recall, we filed our inaugural system resiliency plan or SRP, earlier this year and reached an unopposed settlement in August. We continue to advance our filing through the regulatory process, but as a reminder, the SRP is incremental to our current capital plan. Oncor's SRP investment will total nearly $3 billion of capital expenditures designed to reduce risk and over $500 million of incremental O&M expense, with the majority of the spending to occur in calendar years 2025 to 2027. If approved by the PUCT, we expect to start incurring that spends before the end of the year. We discussed the SRP with the PUCT at its open meeting a couple of weeks ago. And we expect them to continue their consideration of the plan and settlement at their meeting on November 14. We've also developed a leading wildfire mitigation program in the state of Texas and continue to leverage the expertise and insights gained from the Texas Forest Service and SDG&E among others. In addition to the SRP, new investment opportunities are being driven by large C&I customers looking to connect to Oncor system. The continued increase in interconnection interest and commitments comes from large C&I customers spanning multiple diverse industries located throughout Oncor service territory. We are currently executing our fall planning cycle in alignment with Sempra to assess future capital projects, and we'll be announcing our new five year capital plan on the fourth quarter call. Given ongoing economic expansion in Texas and significant new customer growth, plus transmission anticipated within ERCOT, we're expecting a significant increase in our roll forward five year capital plan of anywhere between 40% to 50% from our current capital plan. In Texas, our growth opportunities remain robust and the regulatory framework supports critical new investments to expand our system and improve grid resiliency and reliability for our customers. And across our management team, we couldn't be more excited to support the growing energy needs of our customers. Please turn to the next slide. Next, I'd like to turn your attention to another major tailwind positively impacting Oncor's anticipated service territory growth over both the intermediate and long term. Today, ERCOT projects demand growth in the Permian Basin to quadruple to 26.4 gigawatts in 2038 from the 2023 actual level of 6.6 gigawatts. This represents an impressive compound annual growth of nearly 10%, proving once again that the region has some of the strongest growth prospects in the nation. In early fall, the PUCT approved ERCOT's Permian Basin reliability plan, which permits all common local projects totaling approximately $4 billion to commence immediately, irrespective of the voltage level that the commission will eventually approve for the needed import paths. We expect Oncor to capture a significant portion of the new capital investment opportunities given our current operations in the Permian Basin and ERCOT's preliminary recommendations. Project assignments will be approved by the PUCT. And we're not standing still, as we've already begun preparation for the transmission projects expected to be assigned to Oncor. We'll be filing the necessary certificates of convenience and necessity for those projects beginning in early 2025, and will continue the necessary make ready work throughout the year. These proceedings are expected to take approximately 180 days under Texas law. In terms of the time line, the Permian plan provides that most of the local projects need to be in service by 2030 with all projects, including the import pathway projects, completed by 2038. The full plan calls for a total investment of at least $13 billion in the Permian Basin Territory. Specifically, the Permian plan proposes $4 billion for local projects and another $9 billion or more of transmission CapEx at either 3.45 kV or 7.65 kV voltage levels. The PUCT is expected to make a final decision on 3.45 kV or 7.65 kV import options by May 2025. Please turn to the next slide. Longer term, it is also important to note that ERCOT has provided a preliminary vision of a modern statewide extra high voltage or EHV grid. At this stage, it is preliminary and remains subject to the plan being finalized and obtaining customary regulatory approvals. But assuming the statewide EHV initiative is implemented, Oncor expects to construct a significant number of these projects due to the current number of endpoints owned by Oncor. These projects, when taken together, would add major transmission lines across Add major transmission lines across the state to connect new sources of generation, increase overall electric load serving capability and improve system resiliency. As currently envisioned, Phase 1 of the EHV initiative would include the Permian Plan 7 65 kV lines as well as connections in Eastern and Central Texas, whereas Phase 2 would include connections in the Texas Panhandle and Rio Grande Valley. Now please turn to the next slide where Karen will walk through business updates at Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure. Karen Sedgwick : Thank you, Allen. I'd first like to provide some background on the proposed decision we received in our general rate cases last month. To start, the proposed decision increases the revenue requirement in 2024 by 10.5% for SDG&E and 14.8% for SoCalGas. Moving to rate base, the PD recommends 2024 authorized rate base of $8.4 billion for SDG&E and $12.8 billion for SoCalGas. There are, however, critical aspects of the PD that require additional work, particularly in areas that impact our ability to manage the system safely. Examples include needed investments for integrity management of our natural gas distribution system and selective undergrounding of our electrical system to support wildfire mitigation efforts. On the positive side, you'll recall that our GRC addresses a broad range of topics that are important to the growth of our business. For example, the PD adopted certain infrastructure and technology capital projects that were not included in the base attrition year percentages, but are also important because they'll be placed in rates upon completion. Also as a reminder, the proposed decision makes available a process that allows for certain changes to be considered before a final decision is issued. On November 4, the CPUC heard oral arguments, the records of which are open to the public. SDG&E and SoCalGas' subject matter experts are engaged in a regulatory process and working collaboratively towards reaching a final outcome that's beneficial for all stakeholders. During the quarter, our California utilities also received a final decision in Phase 2 of the cost of capital proceeding, which has a negative impact on the CCM for 2025. This one time formulaic modification lowers ROEs by 42 basis points and reduces the authorized adjustment percentage for future triggers to 20%. The silver lining here is that the declining interest rate environment such as the one we may now find ourselves in limits the magnitude of subsequent reductions in ROE and off cycle years. For planning purposes, I'd also like to note that we expect to file our cost of capital application for the years 2026 to 2028 in March of next year. Turning to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, SDG&E submitted a new TO6 filing on October 30, where we updated our formulaic rate and made the case for a constructive improvement in the authorized ROE to 12.25%. This consists of a base ROE of 11.75% plus a 50 basis point ADR. We believe this proposal reflects current market conditions and we look forward to working through the regulatory process to achieve productive results. Additionally, at Sempra California, we're excited to share that the SDG service territory has seen electric demand growth, hitting a new all-time record peak demand of over 5 gigawatts in September. This reflects growing demand from roughly 160,000 EVs connected to our system, one of the highest EV penetration rates in the country and from continued electrification of the Southern California economy. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to Sempra infrastructure. We continue to witness geopolitical developments around the world, which strengthen the value proposition of our infrastructure franchise. The U.S. is the largest exporter of LNG in the sector, Sempra Infrastructure remains well positioned to supply new customers in European and Asian markets. As Europe continues to reduce its energy imports from Russia, we believe there is a growing need for stable, lower-cost gas supply, which would further drive demand for North American LNG. A few examples include : The EU has recently banned re exports to third-party countries taking effect in March 2025. Ukraine rejected a deal to extend Russian gas through Ukrainian pipelines beyond 2024. The EU's incoming Energy Commissioner has intensified efforts to independence on Russian gas imports. A number of EU member states are demanding tagging of LNG by source as it enters its ports to further cut back on Russian LNG imports, and this is all on top of the major natural gas pipeline capacity that was taken offline at the start of the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, there are strong market consensus that Asian LNG demand will continue to grow dramatically through the next 15 years, with growth estimates range between 70% and 100% from 2023 levels. Much of this demand is tied to the displacement of more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal and refined products from the energy mix of emerging economies in South and Southeast Asia as well as continued demand growth in China and India. Bottom line, Sempra Infrastructure is well positioned to be a preferred provider to establish counterparties seeking to match long-term LNG supply with growing demand in Europe and Asia. Alongside these macroeconomic tailwinds, Cameron LNG Phase 1 continues to perform well. Year-to-date, the facility has already loaded 140 cargoes, and lifetime to date, Cameron has now surpassed 840 cargoes. Notably, the current 2024 production level exceeds the average annual run rate implied since COD. So we continue to witness strong and improving results from this facility. Turning to construction updates. We're advancing work on a series of major projects. ECA LNG Phase 1 construction continues to make progress. The project is now focusing on finishing above-ground piping installation and our time line to bring commercial operations online in spring 2026 remains intact. Additionally, we're pleased to announce the expansion of the GRO pipeline, is expected to commence commercial operations before the end of the year. You will recall this pipeline is dedicated to support LNG exports at ECA. Port Arthur Phase 1 is also advancing as planned and is on time and on budget. Currently, work is focused on piling, dredging, foundations, structural steel and above ground piping installations. We also received a FERC letter of authorization for the Louisiana Connector pipeline, which will provide feed gas into Port Arthur from the Haynesville Basin. Mobilization activities to commence building this pipeline have already begun. Moving to our development efforts at Port Arthur Phase 2, the focus remains on finalizing off take arrangements and securing project financing. We continue to have discussions with potential off-takers. We've made significant commercial progress to date and are focused now on selecting the rate tester mix and improving our commercial terms. Most notably, Saudi Aramco is our anchor partner on the project, with a nonbinding HOA for 5 million tons per annum and a 25% equity participation. As a reminder, we have an EPC agreement with Bechtel to allow for continuous construction across both phases. We also continue to wait for our DOE non-FDA export permit, which we expect to be resolved next year. As a result, we're now expecting Port Arthur Phase 2 development time line to move ahead of the Cameron expansion. The timing of an FID decision for Cameron expansion is uncertain at this point. We continue to work with our partners on the optimal timing for expansion. As we've been in the past, we'll be very disciplined in our efforts to secure quality returns and mitigate risk to capital before making any investment decision. Please turn to the next slide. Earlier this morning, Sempra reported third quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $638 million or $1 per share. This compares to third quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $721 million or $1.14 per share. On an adjusted basis, third quarter 2024 earnings were $566 million or $0.89 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2023 earnings of $685 million or $1.08 per share. Because the GRC outcome remains pending, our CPUC authorized base revenues in third quarter and year-to-date 2024 are based on 2023 authorized levels. This is important because assuming we receive a final decision this year, any true-up will be retroactively applied to January 1. Please turn to the next slide. Variances in the third quarter 2024 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized as followed. At Sempra, California, we had $9 million from higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, including higher authorized cost of capital and higher regulatory interest income. This was more than offset by $52 million, primarily from lower income tax benefits and higher net interest expense. Turning to Sempra Texas. We had $44 million of lower equity earnings from higher interest and operating expenses and lower consumption, partially offset by higher revenues from invested capital and customer growth. At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $36 million of lower revenues in the transportation and renewables business, higher O&M and lower asset and supply optimization, partially offset by $7 million, primarily from higher income tax benefit and lower net interest due to higher capitalized interest. At Sempra parent, the $3 million net change is primarily due to higher taxes, partially offset by net investment gains. Please turn to the next slide. To conclude our prepared remarks, I'd like to quickly summarize our key investment highlights. As energy needs grow and evolve in North America, our commitment to operational excellence supports our focus on delivering safer, more reliable and resilient energy. And our position as a leader in North America's largest economic markets gives us unique opportunity to invest higher levels of capital in critical new energy infrastructure through the end of the decade and beyond. For general corporate purposes and to finance our growing capital campaign, we are establishing an at-the-market equity program of $3 billion. This will help us fund growth in capital expenditures in a timely and efficient manner, while continuing to maintain the strength of our balance sheet. After we received the GRC final decision, we'll be in an excellent position to roll forward our 5-year capital plan through 2029. We expect to provide that update in February on our Q4 call. And in the interim, we'll continue executing on value-accretive investments that drive sustainable, long-term growth. Thank you for joining us. And I'd like to now open the line-up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Nick Campanella : So Jeff, on your comments about demand growth and sector EPS growth kind of trending higher than it's historical norms. You've been growing EPS above the sector already. And I just want to confirm that inclusive of all these items that you laid out on the capital side, do you have line of sight to the CAGR like above the 6% to 8% range? And how should we kind of be thinking about that as you kind of piece together all this capital that's coming down the pipe into the fourth quarter? Jeff Martin : Thank you for that question, Nick. And we've had these conversations before. But when you think about the period from 2000 to 2020, our sector had average EPS growth of roughly 3%. Now that changes from time to time. And in recent years, it's been trending higher closer to 4%. What I think is going to happen is I think we're in a significant growth period for our utility sector, what some people are referring to as a super cycle. In other words, we expect to see growth through this decade and well into the next decade. And I think you're going to see overall average EPS growth across the sector trend higher. We have traditionally oriented towards 6% to 8%. We think there's kind of an efficient frontier there in terms of balancing that with a strong dividend policy. And I think total return is very important to the utility investors that invest in the sector. So we're very comfortable with the 6% to 8% growth rate. And I think the key takeaway from today's call is, we certainly have a field of vision to a lot more opportunities in the future. We certainly will be working hard to exceed the high end of that range but we're comfortable now that with a lot of certainty about the growth backlog we have that we can deliver that range or better. Nick Campanella : And then just quickly on the ATM. When do you think you're going to start to need equity? Is it this year? Or is it next year? You were smart last year to kind of derisk the equity plan ahead of your formal CapEx outlook. So just wondering if that's on the table again, and that's it for me. Jeff Martin : Yes. Thank you very much, Nick. Last year, you recall that we provided a little bit of visibility on our Q3 call to increases in our five year capital plan at the Sempra level. And you're correct, we followed up with a roughly $1.3 billion secondary offering. I think what was interesting in our fall planning process this year and both Justin and I were with Allen last week in Dallas at their Board meeting, they just have remarkable visibility to growth. And I thought it was important for us to signal to our investors that opportunity now rather than wait until the February time frame, we'll obviously give a lot of details in February, but I thought it was important to do that. And make sure that we were adding the ATM as an additional tool in our toolbox. And I think many of you have followed the fact that ATMs have become much more common recently as companies seek alternatives to traditional offerings. So at Sempra, we just view it as another option for us to officially finance our business. We've sized it at the $3 billion level. And I think the best takeaway for everyone is when we get to our February call, we're going to provide a full update on our roll-forward capital program, including, Nick, sources and uses of funding, and we'll also be prepared at that time to provide what I hope will be a robust view of 2026 guidance. Operator : Our next question will come from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Let me just quickly want to follow up on Nick's question on the equity. Just on the $3 billion of ATM, I couldn't get a sense, is that fully funding your anticipated CapEx increases? Or could there be more equity coming, especially as we're thinking about potential funding needs at SIP as that ramps up? Jeff Martin : Yes. What we do is we go through a very comprehensive bottom-up process in the fall, where we force everyone's growth plans inside of Sempra across all 3 platforms to compete for capital. And as you've seen in the past, the lion's share of our five year capital program goes through our U.S. utilities in California and Texas. It traditionally takes -- between 90% and 95% of our overall capital plan goes through our utility. So what we've done at this early juncture is really provide visibility to the fact that there is a significant increase of capital that will be coming out in Oncor's plan when we announce in February, and we thought it was appropriate to make sure we had this additional tool in our toolbox. We're not prepared to talk about when we would use it, but I do think we'll provide a lot of detail on our February call. Shar Pourreza : Okay. But the $3 billion is the $3 billion we shouldn't, I guess, assume it could be higher. Jeff Martin : Exactly. We feel very comfortable with $3 billion. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then just in terms of the proposed decision in California, just from a planning parameter standpoint, does the PD present a headwind versus your midpoint expectations? And sort of given the recommendation for lower attrition year revenue increases, could you see CapEx pulling back at SoCalGas and San Diego Gas & Electric? Jeff Martin : Yes. What I would describe is in the fall planning process, we're challenging all of our executives to make sure that they've got a fulsome and disciplined approach to capital utilization. So there is a process of give and take between both projects as well as overall capital by business. And over a long period of time, forcing that discipline inside the organization to compete for capital. And it's not just highest return, it's also returns relative to risk. So that process is ongoing. A comment I make about the PD is we feel there are some aspects of the PD, Shar, that are actually quite constructive. But we noted in our prepared remarks, that we also see opportunities to improve the decision in areas that we think are very important to our customers namely safety, reliability and affordability. So we had oral arguments earlier this week and a couple of things we highlighted there where we think additional improvements are necessary as the -- number one, the need for additional undergrounding to support wildfire mitigation; number two, improvements to integrity management programs. And you'll recall, that's very important for us in terms of operating the natural gas distribution system safely. To your point, we do think additional increases in post year funding is important because that has to align with our expected business level of activity. And finally, we're still identifying areas that might offset cost to our customers because of our focus on affordability, and that's mainly in the form of tax benefits. So I would conclude by saying we'll continue to work collaboratively. We don't want to get in front of our regulator on this. But I think we have the chance, Shar, to do two things : get to an outcome this year and get to an outcome that's constructive for all of our stakeholders. Operator : Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Maybe just picking up on the Oncor side that 40% to 50% range is tantalizing there. Look, I know it's preliminary, but can you give us a little bit of a breakdown? I know you got the $3 billion with the SRP. But what else is in there, right? When you think about that balance of, say, roughly $6 billion to $9 billion, is that Permian Basin? How much of that is low growth? Can you give us a little bit of sense of what's baked in, in terms of that range and where you go from it? Jeff Martin : Well, Julien, the good news is you live in Texas. So hopefully, you've been seeing a lot of this first-hand. For several years now, you and I have had this conversation as well as others. I have consistently said that Oncor has the best overall growth program in the country. I think we're seeing that play out in real time. And I think we have an opportunity, Allen, if you don't mind. Why don't we walk through some of the growth drivers that you're seeing and provide additional color for Julien. Allen Nye : Yes, you bet, Jeff. And thanks, Julien. We continue to see just very strong growth across our service territory pretty much in all categories of various types of customers that we serve. Strong residential and meter growth, strong growth on our transmission system, especially regarding LC&I interconnections, strong growth in West Texas and the Permian and increased opportunities to invest in kind of the transmission backbone of ERCOT to support our customers bulk power transfers across the state. As I said in my opening remarks or Jeff did, premise growth continues to be very strong. We added 19,000 this quarter and we continue to see long-term growth around 2% or double the national average. Transmission points of interconnection continue to be a big deal for us. New transmission point of interconnections were up 38% versus the same quarter last year. Total transmission point of interconnections were up 17% versus the same quarter last year. Generation remains very strong. We have over 500 projects seeking to interconnect to us right now in our queue, gives us about a 13% increase over the same quarter last year for generation. The biggest jump continues to be with regards to LC&I customers seeking to connect to our transmission system. We have 379 of those right now, and that represents a 23% increase over the same quarter last year, but the real story is in request from what we refer to as large load customers, right? The customers that are seeking to interconnect with our system that are seeking to interconnect at a level of at least 100 megawatts individually all the way up to multiple gigawatts. I think I represented the last quarter that we had about 80 gigawatts of those customers. And a quarter later, we're now up to 103 gigawatts of potential load additions related to that group of customers. Of that 103, 82 gigawatts approximately is data center related and 21 approximately gigawatts is unrelated to data centers. So I just want to make two points with regards to that 103 number. If you look at our system right now, our current peak load on the Oncor system is about 31 gigawatts. So when you're comparing that to 103 gigawatts, we're looking at potential load additions of more than 3x our current peak load. That's one. And then the other point, which I just made briefly a moment ago is 103 gigawatts this quarter versus 80 gigawatts last quarter represents about a 29% increase in potential load from these types of customers in one quarter. So that continues to be a big driver of what we're looking at going forward into February. West Texas, again, remains a great story with the Far West Texas weather zone peaking at about 15% above the 2023 peak. Our two transmission loops that we serve the Permian and the Delaware through continue to be strong with The Culberson Loop, up 26% versus the peak of last year already and the Stanton Loop up 5.7%. So the strong growth we're seeing in West Texas. Obviously, we can talk about the Permian plant in a minute, but it's also leading to, what I would call, base load -- the non-Permian plan additions in the region, including projects that are coming out of the Delaware Basin project study of 2019. We're presently in stages 2 through 5 of that group of projects as well as the Permian Basin load integration study project from 2021, which we now refer to as the West Texas infrastructure project. So we have a number of transmission projects moving forward out of those two studies and plans that are separate and apart from the Permian plan. Obviously, we still have the Permian plan, Permian Basin reliability plan going through the PUC process right now as well as the extra high-voltage plan that was mentioned previously. We've got our SRP still to come, hopefully on November 14. And then we have, of course, the ERCOT revised load forecast of 152 gigawatts as well as the general regional transmission plan coming out in December. So those are a lot of the things that we are looking at with our Board right now. Very excited to have all these opportunities on our system. We think it's a great growth story. And by February, we'll have this all worked out. Jeff Martin : And then, Julien, what I would add just to summarize a couple of points from Allen's discussion is growth at Oncor is both geographically diverse and it cuts across all customer categories. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I think that our AI exposure is an understated investment thesis at Sempra. Think about this, Oncor has 82 gigawatts of pending interconnection request for AI. I would challenge any other company in America to put forward a bigger number. And keep in mind, the entire state of California has a 50 to 55 overall gigawatt peak. So just an interconnection request for AI only, Oncor is dealing with 82 gigawatts of future opportunities. Their growth is also centered on the most valuable asset in the utility world, and that's high voltage transmission. High-voltage transmission comprises 60% of their overall capital plan. And I would also add, in addition to broad exposure to growth, Oncor benefits from a constructive regulatory compact with tracker mechanisms that we've discussed before, they're being filed twice annually to true-up for T&D investments. So it is a remarkable growth story. It is remarkable exposure to transmission and particularly from customer growth and AI. And I think it's got one of the best regulatory compacts in the country. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Yes. Those are truly phenomenal statistic. And I agree, I see it. With that said, actually, you're talking about 60% is high voltage. I mean, what are you guys reflecting in that range on the 765, the higher element on the transmission. Is that basically the upper end there? Just to clarify. Jeff Martin : Yes. As we went through our prepared remarks, there's about $13 billion in that Permian plan, which I think assumes a 345 kV. But I think the most important thing that Allan mentioned was, is the PUCT will be making a determination as to whether that's a 345 upgrade and build out in May or whether it's 765. So that remains to be seen. We'll know the answer to that next year. Operator : And our next question will come from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Maybe just to start on the LNG business. Any -- are you anticipating any changes to the outlook there just as a result of the administration changes. And then, as you think about Port Arthur Phase 2, is the permit sort of the last gating factor that would determine when you take FID on that project? Jeff Martin : And maybe we've got Justin Bird with us here who is the CEO of Sempra Infrastructure perhaps, Justin, you can walk through Port Arthur Phase 2 and then speak to the permit issue that Carly referenced. Justin Bird : As Karen noted in her prepared remarks, we continue to advance Port Arthur 2. And I'd say we've made considerable progress. As noted on our Q2 call, we saw an increased interest in Port Arthur 2, and I'm happy to say that interest has further increased since the call, and momentum continues to build commercial discussions for off-take and project equity are ongoing and I think we're seeing better terms. We have our 20-year agreement with Aramco for 5 million tons per annum as well as 25% of the equity. Our EPC agreement with Bechtel allows for continuous construction. We view that as a competitive advantage. And on the permitting side, as you noted, we're waiting for our DOE non-FTA export permit and we expect that to be resolved in the first half of next year. We continue to identify sources of financing for the project and advance the other key milestones to put us in a position to take a final investment decision. To wrap up, I'd say the expansion of Port Arthur is a terrific opportunity and we look forward to advancing the project. Carly Davenport : That's really helpful commentary there. And then maybe just shift quickly back to Texas and I appreciate all of the commentary there so far. Just as you look forward to 2025, is there anything that you'd highlight that you're looking out for in the legislative session in Texas that could impact the growth outlook there? Jeff Martin : No, I would just say that I think that based upon the meetings we had last week, I think, obviously, 2025 will be the biggest capital deployment year, I think, in that company's history. The team is putting together their overall legislative strategy for next year. And Allan, perhaps, you could just mention if there's anything notable that you want to discuss. Allen Nye : Jeff, I think you covered it. I mean, Carly, there's obviously a lot of chatter in Austin about utility issues. We've had that before. I think we are in an excellent position going into this session as Oncor. Obviously, we're going to have to deal with things like the fallout from Hurricane Beryl. But there is nothing that I am overly concerned about right now. Obviously, we'll have to wait till a few more weeks until we see what bills get filed. But we are more than ready to handle anything that comes our way, and I'm confident and excited going into discussion to see what we can do. . Operator : Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Just can I go back to the equity really quickly. I just want to clarify something. The $3 billion, does that -- is that basically all the equity that you need as you roll forward the plan from -- the five year plan '25 to '29. Can you clarify that? And then maybe any color that you can share in terms of timing of the $3 billion equity. Does that have to be done next year? Or will it be spread out toward the planning period? Jeff Martin : Sure. I'll just start by Durgesh review on what our goal is for February. On our Q4 call, our convention has been to really present our five year capital plan, almost like an analyst conference, frankly. And when we do that, we reconcile the balance sheet and do come a deep dive in to sources and uses of funding. So that conversation is probably more appropriate for February. What we also do in February is we tend to basically go into proper guidance. So we'll release 2026 guidance at that time. We've always felt like if we have some early visibility in the fall before you get to February, where we can kind of guide the street to our expectations, we think that's always been viewed helpful. So I think we had a real opportunity today to come forward with a very bullish, muscular view of our Texas capital program. We'll fine tune that and come out with more details in February. And likewise, on the ATM, we just view this as another financing alternative for us. Our job is to make sure we compete capital internally. We are also using hybrids and as part of our overall funding mechanism and having the ATM in place, we think, is being thoughtful. Durgesh Chopra : I just wanted to clarify that looks like we're going to get more color. Can I just quickly ask you one more question? Just anything on the LNG permit pause given the sort of the election results. Previously, you kind of talked about -- sorry, go ahead, Jeff. Jeff Martin : No, I'm sorry. Please finish your question. Durgesh Chopra : No, that's it. Just any update there as it relates to the pause. Jeff Martin : No. I would just say that maybe a higher level comment. We have intended to kind of run our business as a nonpartisan business, right? We don't focus on 1 party or other. Remember, about six years ago, we refocused our business from energy to energy infrastructure. And historically, that's been an area of strong bipartisan support. And frankly, even under the bond administration, there was bipartisan support for the infrastructure bill. And I think as we look forward, when we think about delivering cleaner and secure energy, it's not more about one party or another, it's about knowing what's best for our country and for our customers. So when it comes to LNG. We've always had a constructive view that America has an opportunity to play a larger role in the world. I think you're going to continue to see this country, a leadership position in the production of energy. It's going to basically benefit our domestic uses. Hopefully, it will continue to support a growing economy here in the United States. But look, quite frankly, we have an increasingly important role in serving our allies abroad. And LNG is a very, very important tool of American Foreign Policy. I think you'll continue to see us take an important role at Sempra Infrastructure. And I think we have growing confidence in getting the permits we need for Port Arthur Phase 2 in the first half of next year. Operator : And we now have time for one more question. And our last question will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Steve Fleishman : I appreciate it. Just going back to the California case, you mentioned -- and affordability seems to be a focus and you mentioned the tax-related benefits that could be something you suggested. Could you give us a sense of just how much that could impact rates to the benefit of customers and your thinking on that? Jeff Martin : I think what took place in the proposed decision was they outlined but they thought the changes in the step-up in revenue requirement was for year one and then through the attrition years. And I think we're being really focused on making sure that we can operate our systems safely. We're working with all the different parties or a part of the proceeding. And as you do that, it's important if you're trying to propose additional funding that you're also trying to find ways to reduce cost. So I think what took place in the oral argument this week was we outlined a series of opportunities where we thought that customers would benefit from additional safety investments, including to our integrity programs into our wildfire undergrounding programs. And I think to do that we've also proposed some additional tax benefits that would lessen the impact to customers. So this is a process in California where you try to work with all the different stakeholders to get to a good outcome. I think we have some confidence that we'll get that done this year and then we'll get to an outcome that people feel good about. Steve Fleishman : And just based on the kind of proposals you made there, like, the attrition adjustments, what would they be roughly per year relative to the proposed decision? Jeff Martin : Yes. What I don't want to do is I don't really want to front run the process we're in right now. We're actually making some comment filings tomorrow. And what we want to do is let the process roll forward, give everyone the opportunity to participate in it. I think the decision itself that we have today has proposed, there's a lot of constructive aspects to it but we're very deeply involved in it right now, Steve, over the next couple of weeks. So I'd prefer to let the process play out. And our comments tomorrow, I think will be instructive to your question. Steve Fleishman : And then lastly, just on Oncor, which is phenomenal. I remember you raised your capital plan to $48 billion overall from, I think $40 billion back. I think that was early this year or late last year. Would this be all incremental to the $48 billion for all of Sempra, Were some of that already including somewhat higher capital at Oncor? There's been so many capital increases. It's hard to keep track of. Jeff Martin : Thank you for framing a high-class problem, by the way. So look, we're going through a very disciplined process. This is not a process at Sempra where you just put one project on top of another project and sum up the total of the capital. We do, Steve, really go through a rigorous process to make capital compete. But there's no question that the growth we're seeing at Oncor will be incremental to our $48 billion and there's still opportunities that other two business platforms to also grow their capital needs. So that process is underway today. But clearly, the Oncor program is incremental to the $48 billion. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks. Jeff Martin : Well, we certainly appreciate everyone joining us on the call today. I'd like to close out with a few summary comments. First, we're optimistic about finalizing our general rate cases here in California by the end of the year and we'll work with all parties to get to a constructive outcome. Second, I was pleased that we're able to update everyone today on developments at Oncor. We see significant investment opportunities in Texas from the SRP program, diverse customer growth across Oncor service territory, including connection requests from data centers totaling 82 gigawatts. We also see new investments necessary to support growth in the Permian Basin and expanding the transmission backbone for ERCOT. Third, note that at our infrastructure business, we continue to operate a growing portfolio of assets and also are managing several major construction projects simultaneously, which should, together translate into higher levels of growth in the future for Sempra. And finally, the strength of our three combined growth platforms gives us a lot of confidence and continued to grow our business while delivering shareholder value over the long-term. I would also like to mention that Trevor Mihalik will be retiring at the end of the year has served at Sempra for over a decade, held numerous leadership positions and been a great partner to me. Please join me in thanking Trevor for all of his contributions. If there are any follow-up items, please reach out to our IR team with your questions and we certainly look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in Florida next week. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
