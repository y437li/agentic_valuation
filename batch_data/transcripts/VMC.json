James - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee James Thomas Hill - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President John R. McPherson - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Analysts : Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division Operator : Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Earnings Conference Call. My name is Phyllis, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. James, you may begin. Donald M. James: Thank you. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our first quarter 2014 results. As the operator said, I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are John McPherson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Hill, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. A slide presentation will accompany this webcast and will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of the presentation contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's first quarter 2014 earnings release and at the end of this presentation. We are very encouraged by our performance during the first quarter and with the recovery in demand for our products. Despite the challenges inherent in an unusually cold and wet winter in many of our markets, our employees delivered solid shipment growth and improved margins. During the quarter, we successfully completed the previously announced sale of our Florida area cement and concrete assets to Argos, as well as the related repurchase of $506 million of our outstanding debt. Vulcan is well positioned to increase our shipments and our earnings, and to expand our aggregates operations and reserves as we move forward. Turning now to Slide 3. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong earnings leverage in our aggregates business. Aggregates volumes increased 6% and we leveraged those incremental tons into significantly higher earnings. The 9% increase in net sales led to a 93% increase in gross profit. Reported earnings from continuing operations were $0.41 per diluted share versus a loss of $0.47 in the prior year. Included in these earnings improvements are $1.04 per diluted share of income related to the sale of the company's Florida area cement and concrete assets, and $0.35 per diluted share in charges to interest expense referable to the $506 million of debt repurchase. Adjusted for these onetime transactions, earnings from continuing operations were a loss of $0.28 per diluted share, a $0.19 per share improvement from last year. Reported EBITDA for the quarter was $267 million, which includes a $220 million gain from the sale of Florida concrete and cement assets, and $7 million in other income, primarily from the routine sale of reclaimed land from former operating sites. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA grew 50%, from $26 million last year to $39 million this year. This improvement was driven by both increased aggregate shipments and by higher aggregate prices, which more than offset higher costs resulting from production challenges due to weather. Non-aggregate cash gross profit benefited from higher asphalt volumes and higher materials margin. With that said, I'd like to now turn the call over to Tom Hill to give us a few more specifics about our first quarter results. James Thomas Hill : Thanks, Don. Taking a look at the aggregates segment results on Slide 4, you'll see the resulting revenue and gross profit impact from higher shipments and pricing. Aggregates segment revenues increased 13% and segment gross profit increased 55%. Aggregates shipments increased 6% versus the prior year, despite very cold weather in most of our markets. Shipments in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Texas showed strength, each increasing by more than 15% versus the first quarter of last year. Due to favorable -- due to unfavorable weather, first quarter shipments in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina were lower versus the prior year. Strengthening private construction demand more than offset the effects of extremely cold weather in Georgia, and unusually wet weather in Florida, resulting in year-over-year growth in shipments in these markets. In other areas harder hit like Virginia, the number of available shipping days was cut in half by extreme winter weather. This restriction on construction activity and available shipping days impacted both our aggregates and concrete business in Virginia. That said, we expect shipments delayed beyond the end of March due to weather to be recovered in the following months as the construction season gets underway. Aggregates pricing for the quarter was up 2% versus the prior year. These solid results were despite an unfavorable geographic mix due to the impact of weather on volumes in several higher price markets. Without the unfavorable geographic mix impact due to weather, our year-over-year pricing increased 3%. Slide 5 highlights the favorable operating leverage in our aggregates business. Trailing 12-month volumes have increased 8 million tons or 6%, while aggregates segment's gross profit improved $84 million or 25% due to higher pricing, the earnings leverage of volume growth and cost control. Turning to Slide 6. We compare our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton at the end of the first quarter with the prior year and the prior peak volume, which occurred in the first quarter of 2006. Trailing 12-month unit profitability has increased 6% from the prior year. More significantly, cash gross profit per ton is 31% higher than the prior peak volume. This is remarkable considering the fact that current volume is 50% below the prior peak. This improvement of more than $1 per ton reflects the accomplishments of our employees to effectively manage cost and improve price throughout this downturn. This per ton gain also illustrates the attractive structural characteristics of our aggregates business. Higher unit profitability sets the stage for significant earnings growth in this improving demand cycle. Now I will turn the call over to John to provide some commentary about the outlook. John R. McPherson: Thanks, Tom. Our volume growth in the first quarter and resulting earnings improvement that Tom just discussed are a really solid start to what we believe will be a very strong year for overall demand growth. The demand momentum, which began in the second half of 2013, is continuing in 2014. And our margins are expanding due to the combination of operating leverage, cost disciplines and growth in pricing. Turning now to Slide 7. You see a breakdown of our expectations for aggregates demand by each of the major end markets. These expectations are consistent with the demand outlook we discussed during our fourth quarter conference call in February, but let me share a bit of color regarding what we see in the market as of the end of the first quarter. Two points to start. First, we continue to expect each end market to grow in 2014, with private construction recovering most rapidly. Secondly, we expect Vulcan's served markets to grow at a faster rate than the markets we do not serve. We're very pleased with how our portfolio is positioned, as the recovery in construction activity continues to take hold. Now touching on activity and trends in specific end-use markets. In private residential, we continue to see broad-based growth across our geography, led by states such as Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. But in addition, we're also seeing residential construction activity in aggregates demand recovering in important areas such as Atlanta, Charlotte and Nashville. In private nonresidential, our markets are beginning to benefit from some growth in office and commercial work, complemented importantly by rising demand from large industrial projects. As we've noted before, these projects can represent large quantities of aggregates supplied over multiple years. And Vulcan is very well positioned to serve these customers, particularly along the Gulf Coast. These projects provide an exciting opportunity for our aggregates business. That said, the timing of shipments can vary and we continue to monitor them before the actual shipment days. Now we're also seeing strengthening large project activity in the public arena, including in transportation infrastructure. Although it has taken longer than most of us expected, federally funded TIFIA projects are beginning to drive additional aggregate shipments. The Grand Parkway in Houston and the Northwest Corridor in Atlanta are just 2 projects we expect to begin shipments to in 2014, or have already begun to make shipments to. Additionally, state-level funding initiatives across several states are beginning to drive new project lettings, with Virginia and Maryland just being 2 examples. While the parameters surrounding the renewal of the Federal Highway Bill remain uncertain, large transportation infrastructure projects and the growth in contract awards we've already seen should provide reasonably stable demand in this end market for the balance of the year. Overall, we expect modest growth in shipments in the public end markets in 2014, and we're optimistic with respect to public infrastructure construction in 2015 and beyond. So while the first quarter does not make a year, our local teams and our customers are excited by what they see in the early stages of this recovery. Activity and confidence are rising across an increasingly broad group of geographies and end uses. And we believe Vulcan's people and assets are very well positioned to meet our customers' rising aggregates demands during this time. Before turning the call back over to Don for some closing remarks, I'll comment on 2 additional topics that continue to be priorities, particularly as we look toward another year of earnings growth and hopefully a multiple year recovery in demand. The first topic is the strengthening of our balance sheet. During the quarter, both our sale of cement and concrete assets to Argos and our repurchase of approximately $500 million in debt closed as expected. As you can see on Slide 8, net debt to trailing adjusted EBITDA is down from 6.4x to 3.6x. Coupled with unit margins and earnings, this improvement in our balance sheet allows us the flexibility to reinvest in growth, whether through margin-enhancing capital projects, bolt-on acquisitions, or other opportunities to strengthen our aggregates franchise. And of course, we've continued to add to our portfolio as opportunities present themselves. Over the past 18 months, we have acquired assets and improved on our ability to serve customers in areas such as San Diego, Atlanta, San Antonio, Charleston and Northern Virginia. The second topic I would like to highlight briefly relates to the value of the land we own and our commitment to manage these holdings in a manner that generates value for both our shareholders and the communities in which we operate. Our first quarter results included $18 million in cash proceeds and a $6 million pretax gain on the sale of 2 properties, a former Baltimore area quarry, of which a schematic depicting the intended use is shown here on Slide 9; and a parcel of land on the river in Chattanooga. Those of you who have followed our company closely know that the disposition -- that dispositions such as these are not at all out of the ordinary. Since 1998, we have generated an average annual cash proceeds of approximately $32 million from land sales. Vulcan owns more than 110,000 acres of land, a significant portion of which is in urban or urbanizing areas. We will continue to operate and develop these properties with an eye toward their post mining uses and the ultimate value to both our shareholders and our neighbors. I'll now turn the call back over to Don for some closing comments. Donald M. James: Thanks, John. Let me close by saying that we're encouraged by the improving economic fundamentals we see in our footprint. Our outlook for aggregate volume and price growth remains very positive, consistent with the guidance we gave in February. We expect 2014 to be another year of earnings growth for Vulcan, and we're well positioned to capitalize on the multiyear recovery in demand that we believe is in front of us. Thus far, in this recovery, we have leveraged modest volume growth and strong growth in earnings due to the operating leverage inherent in our aggregates business and the disciplined execution of our operation and sales teams. This operational performance by our teams gives us tremendous earnings upside as volume recovery continues. In our non-aggregates segments, we continue to expect to earn $40 million to $60 million in gross profit in 2014. These improved results include higher earnings in asphalt and the return to profitability of our concrete segment. With our improved capital structure, we're excited about the possibilities of expanding our aggregates operations and reserve base and further enhancing our footprint in the fastest-growing U.S. markets. We are continuing to pursue a number of attractive growth opportunities that will enhance our earnings potential. This is an exciting time and an excellent opportunity for Vulcan, and we remain committed to adding lasting value built around our unmatched asset base. And now, the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I was hoping to touch on margins. I know you mentioned you were pleased with the performance in the quarter. And specifically on the aggregate side, I was wondering if you could just walk through kind of the puts and the takes on the incrementals, what weather impact may have been in the quarter if you're able to impute it based on shipping days available and maybe just start there? John R. McPherson: Sure, Ted. This is John. First, I'd say there were 2 major weather-related impacts that affected our incrementals in the quarter. One was production, both amount and efficiency. And we had an inventory reduction in the quarter, which led to about a $2.8 million negative variance of profitability for us for the quarter. The other impact, as Tom mentioned, was a negative geographic mix in terms of pricing and margin, and that contributed another negative $3.7 million in headwinds to us. So on a normal geographic mix and on a normal production basis, we would have been $6.5 million or so higher in the aggregate segment gross profit line. When you walk that across and there's one other thing I'd note, I think, Ted, you get to the kind of numbers that you're used to seeing, we continue to believe in the 60% flow-through number that we stated before, particularly through the cycle. And again, I think, when you make those adjustments for both the geographic mix and for production, you'll see the kind of incrementals you're used to seeing from us. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Was there anything on the freight side or the logistics side that was a notable call out in terms of just the dilution would add to the underlying volume-based incrementals? John R. McPherson: Well, there's 1 -- that's an important question. I think, 1 thing to note, within our aggregates segment, we have intentionally grown our transportation-related revenues and this is a profit enhancement for us. These revenues come with substantially no capital commitment but they already lower margin as a percent of sales. So in the quarter, those revenues grew from about $60 million to $80 million as being supporting products and services, transportation-related. So Ted, to be clear, what I call the non-direct stone revenue, that grew at a rate of 32%, 33% during the quarter. It's very -- it lends to our incremental margins per tons sold. It's very good for us to do. It's an important profit enhancement, but it does, if you look at the total segment numbers, dilute the margin. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. That's really helpful. So the last thing I'll ask, and I'll jump back in queue, is you talked about the cash cost per ton being down 8% year-on-year, could you just bridge us what the key variables were in the first quarter and then how we should think about those variables in the second through fourth quarter? John R. McPherson: I'll probably let Tom comment. But the cash margin was up is what I'd highlight, not the cash cost down. James Thomas Hill : The cash cost -- this is Tom, Ted. The cash cost per ton was virtually flat. And that is attributed to our people in that they were operating in really tough conditions, which affect -- negatively affect operating parameters. So we were pleased with a relatively flat cash cost year-over-year. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : And then, as we think about that cost dynamic going forward, I know you said there's a lot of labor leverage going forward but are there any other kind of headwinds or tailwinds we should just be mindful of as we kind of model going forward? James Thomas Hill : I think that the rising volumes always help those cash costs because there's a big piece to that. I think, our folks have done a good job keeping our equipment and operations in good shape, ready for rising volumes. And that's a matter of really adding hours at this point. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. And the last thing I'll just ask before I jump back in queue, any chance you could just characterize kind of how April started off or the quarter started off? John R. McPherson: I think, Ted, we'll have to answer that when we get into the second half. Our volumes were up more in March than they were in the balance of the quarter. I think, they were up 9% in March. We like the momentum through the quarter and coming out of the second half of last year. But let's talk about April when we get to our second half call. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Unknown Analyst : [indiscernible] filling in for Bob. So if I do the math on your assumptions for end market growth, it would imply aggregates volume growth at the top end of your guidance range. As compared to the outlook provided in February, would you say you were more encouraged about the outlook for volume growth at this point in the year? James Thomas Hill : Well, I think, we're experiencing broad-based growth throughout all of our markets. And we're hearing a lot of -- this is Tom, I'm sorry, and we're hearing a lot of confidence from customers, suppliers and employees. To try to give you a little color, throw a local color on that, the California -- the private segment in California continues to improve. UCLA is predicting housing permits up 27%. Texas was really hitting on all 8. Residential and non-res continues to improve in Texas. We're beginning to see new subdivisions in Houston and San Antonio. We secured a number of very large energy-related projects along the coast. The large -- the 4 largest of which would be over 2 million tons. And then, the highway segment in Texas is healthy. We talked about before we secured the Grand Parkway in Houston, which is a TIFIA project, we begin to ship it. The central U.S. is a little slower to return, but we are starting to see recovery. We've secured a number of large projects in Illinois and residential is starting to -- we're seeing growth in residential in Nashville and Knoxville. Georgia is a market that we're very pleased with, the residential continues to accelerate and commercial is following. And while the highway funding is flat, we have secured the Northwest Corridor, which John mentioned earlier, which is a TIFIA project, they'll start to ship probably towards the end of 2014. Our Florida market continues also to improve. Residential continues to grow, commercial is following that healthy. With health -- an example of that is the Doral Breeze project in Miami, where we secured 750,000 tons. The Carolinas, we're starting to see residential improved in the Carolinas, really driven by Charlotte, as John mentioned. In Virginia, we also see improved residential and some big projects like the Midtown Tunnel, which is a TIFIA project. So overall, we have a lot of confidence in our markets. I think, you do have to remember, this is the first quarter, and there's a lot of -- to play out, there's a lot of noise in the first quarter. So at this point, I think, I'd have to tell you we're comfortable with our range. Unknown Analyst : That's great. And then, on pricing, aggregate prices were up 2% versus your guidance of 3% to 5%. And so how much is your expectation for accelerated pricing gains as a function of improving mix versus maybe a true pricing power as volume growth accelerates? James Thomas Hill : Well, I think, we're seeing pricing momentum all across the markets. Now as we say early on, every market, even submarket, prices at different times, it is a whole mix there of timing of pricing. But while we -- even through the downturn, we were able to get price increases. So with growing markets, growing demand, growing confidence, it just gives you better pricing momentum. Again, much like volume, we're -- just coming out of the first quarter, there was a lot of noise in there. So we -- I think, we're comfortable with that until we have a few more months of real construction cycle under our belts. John R. McPherson: I think, you hit the keyword, which is momentum. And while it's early, we're really excited about the momentum, both on the volume side across geographies, and as Tom mentioned, on the pricing and margin side in our business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the private nonresidential buildings estimate you have. Very bullish estimate here, both in your markets and as a whole. Can you kind of list off 1, 2 or 3, which of those you think will be the best and which could be potential laggers this year in that segment? James Thomas Hill : I think, the best was going to be the private residential. And that's typical in that the non-res will follow the private -- the housing. But there's a component to the non-res that is a little different this time and that is the big energy-related projects that we've seen along the ports. So the answer to your question, to be clear about it, across the country, residential is leading but non-res is, as usual, comes behind it. But that non-res is bolstered by those -- the big energy plays on the Gulf Coast. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : So, and within nonresidential, you would expect the energy and I assume industrial to be the leader in office and retail development to be a little less than that, would that be fair? James Thomas Hill : I think, right now, right at this time, that's correct. But you are starting to see the building and the -- come on and the traditional non-res, strip centers and things like that, you're starting to see those come on which are -- it's following the residential. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : And for Vulcan, is the aggregate intensity, how do those end user markets within nonresidential compare? Donald M. James: Well, historically, highways are the most aggregate-intensive. Industrial projects would be next because, particularly the ones on the Gulf Coast, the first step in the process is to build a pad on which you can expand a refinery or build an LNG facility or an industrial plant along the Gulf Coast in low-lying areas. So those are significantly aggregate-intensive. Then, traditional commercial construction will be next and residential is the least aggregate-intensive. Although in the residential area, as you know, the primary use of aggregates is in lot development, streets and utilities and infrastructure. And in this, unlike residential construction 1 year or 18 months ago, we're now in a lot development phase, which is more aggregate-intensive than residential would be thought as steady state. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Question on the $2.8 million inventory drawdown in the quarter. Just wondering, was this primarily in weather-hit markets or is it a bit more broad-based? And if you could talk about the outlook for inventory management for the balance of the year and if there's going to be any impact on incremental margins? James Thomas Hill : Garik, this is Tom. The drawdown on inventory was really due to the bad weather, the cold weather in the East. It is just very inefficient or impossible to run in snow and ice. So that was intentional on our part. And I don't see that inventory being an impact going forward, we'll catch that up and move on. But you just -- you create a lot of cost and a lot of pain for yourself if you try to run in really, really bad weather. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That makes sense. And I guess, if you could talk about -- you touched upon your views on private non-res. And you've talked about for a couple of quarters now the sensitivity to your guidance, depending on whether or not some of these big projects in the South commenced this year and certain timing around these projects. As you move through the first quarter, as we sit here in early May, can you talk about your visibility with respect to these big projects now as opposed to a quarter ago, and what your level of confidence that they actually get started this year versus next year? James Thomas Hill : We've seen a couple of those projects start. We begin to ship a few of them. But we are still unclear as to the timing of a few others, and that's based on permit or engineering plans. So at this point, we need to see another quarter before we have real clarity on those big projects because when they go, a lot of them go really fast. So we still got some uncertainty on timing at this point. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That's fair. And I guess, just a couple of housekeeping questions, I think, mainly for John. Could you provide an update on your view on SG&A for the year, as well as depreciation costs? John R. McPherson: Sure. On SG&A, we, of course, continue to manage it very, very tightly. We're very confident that we will be able to offset any normal increases in SG&A due to wage increases or those types of things with other savings. And so we'd expect it to be flat to down for the year. And equally importantly, we are very confident we will continue to leverage sales growth and profit growth through time. On -- does that answer your question? Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. And DD&A and then maybe interest as well. John R. McPherson: DD&A and interest. DD&A we'd see as $265 million for the full year, and that reduction from last year, as a reminder, is largely due to the assets we divested. So that's $265 million versus I think $305 million last year. Interest expense would be in the range for the full year of $165 million to $170 million. The run rate reduction with our bond repurchase is about $32 million. And to save you asking, tax rate for the full year we see it at around 28%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: I appreciate the color that you had regarding the mix impact on pricing, but one thing I want to talk about a little bit is we look forward and knowing that you're going to have more infrastructure-related projects coming forward, how should we think about managing product mix in regard to modeling pricing, knowing that you're going to have a greater mix of base, which is a lower price point but you're still getting pricing on that. So if you could help us how we should think about that, not just for the upcoming quarter but over the next 12 to 24 months? James Thomas Hill : This is Tom, Kathryn. I'll look back on that, we did not have a big impact on our first quarter for mix. And I think, we have -- going forward, I wouldn't see us having a substantial mix impact on pricing. I think, there's a pretty good balance there. I think, we have a handle on that. And while we will see some large base jobs, we are also going to see substantial concrete rock and asphalt rock work. So I don't see a big mix impact on price. John R. McPherson: You talked a bit for margin also, right? James Thomas Hill : Yes. That mix of business doesn't hurt our margin either. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Okay. Great. And we've been following TIFIA for a bit now. Could you give a little bit more clarity on how much of TIFIA projects are being captured in your current volume guidance for the year? And it's difficult to put it in buckets on a percentage basis, but can you give a better sense of will it be more like 10% or 15% type this year or do you see more momentum into 2015? But in general, giving some sense of the relative mix and momentum of this TIFIA project as they ramp up? James Thomas Hill : This is Tom again. Let me see if I can work you through some TIFIA jobs that we either have or have on the horizon. We have the Regional Connector in California, which is a small job. The Grand Parkway in Houston, which we talked about is a very large job, which will -- has started shipping and will impact this year. The I-4 expansion in Orlando is a job that just bid and was awarded. It's a little bit unclear of where the materials will go at this point and that job probably will not start until '15. The Northwest Corridor that we talked about in Atlanta, which is a very big job, the highway expansion in Atlanta that has an impact of about 1.4 million tons. But again, that will start shipping in late '14. The Midtown Tunnel in Northern Virginia, that job is around 800,000 tons, we are shipping that job currently. And in the Duluth [ph] Metro Rail in Northern Virginia, that's really a concrete job that we'll supply with our Northern Concrete group has an impact of about 140,000 to 150,000 cubic yards. So that gives you a view of what we know about right now. Most of those, we have secured. Some of them we'll ship this year. A lot of that we'll ship in 2015 and beyond. Does that answer your question? Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Yes, it is. It's really we're in a very, very early stages of seeing the volumes flow through, which is helpful. James Thomas Hill : I think, that's right. It's early stages. And I think, when you look at large projects overall, and maybe back to Garik's question, what we have is we have much better visibility to the awards and to the backlogs and to our -- what we have left is those are 2 exact shipment dates. But the momentum in the overall demand is there and is growing and the question is just one of timing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Quick question on the mix again. And Tom, I know you mentioned that you don't expect a real impact and didn't see a real impact as far as product mix goes on pricing. But geographic mix obviously had a little bit of impact in the first quarter. And then, you touched on these large energy projects coming up over the next few years in the Gulf. Also there's some port deepening and other activities going on in the Gulf as well. And with Florida being a pretty high-priced market relative to some, should we expect a positive mix impact from just geographic mix impact on pricing as we look over the next several quarters and the next year? James Thomas Hill : The answer to your question is yes. Obviously, we're hit hard on the East Coast with weather in the first quarter. That will catch up. As that catches up, it will have a positive impact on price. Also Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, which have attractive pricing, as their markets come back, and as the Florida market comes back, we will see positive impact on pricing. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : But just specifically to some of the activity in the Gulf, do you think that those will be priced as such that will -- you'll be able to realize more of that price impact or mix impact, I guess, as these big, large projects come in? Just trying to get a sense for how you think those are going to be situated? James Thomas Hill : I think, those are at attractive prices. And I think, they will have a positive impact on pricing. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, also, kind of on that note, I'm assuming a lot of that, with all the activity in the Gulf, a lot of that would be coming from the Yucat\u00e1n, a lot of that product. So how should we think about margins on that rock? Would they be any different than typical coming out of the Yucat\u00e1n? James Thomas Hill : Those are very attractive margins and they will help us. Donald M. James: And Trey, on the point, we have a very significant competitive advantage on projects on the Gulf Coast because it's a straight shot, as you know, up from our quarry on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. And so those are really good projects for us both in terms of pricing and margin. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : It seems like you guys are set up nicely to benefit from those. John R. McPherson: Trey, one more slightly different point on geographic mix, just worth noting for the group. In our -- again, as Tom mentioned, our Virginia, Maryland markets, and through the Carolinas really were hit by weather. And just to give you a sound bite on that, our ready-mix volumes in Virginia, Maryland were down 19% versus the prior year. They're up everywhere else. And so it obviously impacted our results significantly in that segment for the quarter. But just to give you a sense, Tom had mentioned how we had half the shipping days go away in Virginia and Maryland. And so that will rebound as we go through the year. But you shouldn't lose that as a driver of mix and as a driver of concrete segment performance in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Can you talk about the large-scale infrastructure projects that are likely to move towards TIFIA financing? Is your visibility and lead times better than it's been in prior cycles? We're hearing from some contractors that their jobs for mid to late '15 that already visibility is pretty good on, which would be much earlier, I guess, than the typical bid cycle than prior cycles. I'm wondering if you're seeing that as well. And then, just based on the project flow, can you talk about, with a rough sense, of what proportion of your aggregate shipments in '15 and '16 could ultimately be towards TIFIA-related projects? Donald M. James: Jerry, we are -- continue to be very active in monitoring and working with potential contractors on the large TIFIA projects. The substantial majority of those projects are in our footprint and the reason for that simply is these have to be revenue-generating projects. And many of them are toll roads. And in order to get the traffic counts necessary to generate the revenue stream to support the TIFIA financing, you have to be in large, congested metropolitan areas. So California, Texas, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Illinois, those are where most of the big TIFIA projects are located, which happen to be fortunately markets where we have very substantial positions. So we think we will get more than our fair share of the TIFIA projects. And as I said, we want to work very closely with the contractors in order to help them achieve the best value for the aggregates and other heavy materials and products in markets where we have those on those projects. That being said, and I think, Tom took you through a list of the ones that we currently have booked or active and working on, that's a very important part of our future demand. It is not possible for us to tell you today what portion of our projected shipments in '14, '15 or '16 don't go to TIFIA projects because we simply don't know what the timing of those projects is going to be or the level of our participation. We won't get every TIFIA project in our footprint because we have competitive markets wherever we operate. But it will be a significant boost to our volume. But in order to try to give you the kind of specificity as to what percentage growth will be in each of the next 3 years on TIFIA projects, we simply don't have the data to do that. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. But it does sound like the visibility has improved, as you pointed out, we've all been waiting for those projects to get moving and it sounds like it's finally starting to play out. Donald M. James: It is. And they've been slow coming out of the U.S. DOT. Part of it was the shift from -- as you know, under the statute, the federal government could provide up to 49% of the total financing. Because the number of projects was substantially oversubscribed, the DOT and the Treasury decided they would cut back maximum participation to about 33%. So some of the projects had to go back and redo their financing in order to meet that 33% test. That's been one of the issues. And just the fact that there was a huge increase in TIFIA, and therefore, a huge increase in the number of projects submitted to the DOT has certainly slowed the process of review and approval. But as we have noted and you have noted, finally, under the new MAP-21 version of TIFIA, which dramatically increased the federal support there, that we're seeing those beginning to materialize. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, from a capital deployment standpoint, you've obviously reduced leverage pretty aggressively here. How should we think about capital deployment from here? Anything to do before your December 2015 notes become due? John R. McPherson: Nothing to do before the notes come due. We'll likely pay those off as they come due out of operating cash flow. I think, the answer to your question, as we noted in our remarks, is that we are very well positioned to pursue growth opportunities as they arise. We'll be disciplined in how we do that. But we think there's a real opportunity in the market these days to smartly grow our footprint and our franchise. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Don and Tom, you guys have both talked about the growth in residential communities, which I guess, were basically dead for a while and are now coming back. Can you talk about whether that community development activity is picking up and how far away you think we might be from reaching kind of parity where, I guess, we're developing a lot for every lot we're building on? Donald M. James: I'll give you one small example. I was in San Antonio last week with our management team and there's lot development going on everywhere. I think, the same thing is happening in Phoenix and Atlanta, lot of other markets, as Tom mentioned, Nashville and Charlotte. I don't have any metrics to say that we will reach equilibrium in lot development and home starts by day X. But at this point, I think, you've seen the statistics that say house prices are moving up sharply in most markets because the inventory levels of new homes are dramatically reduced. You know what incentive that creates for homebuilders. They need lots to build new houses to meet the demand and we're seeing a tremendous amount of lot development. It's very geographically specific, but it's all based on the markets where there's population growth, household formation, job creation. That's been a big driver. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Got it. That makes a ton of sense. Is it fair to say, as people, I guess, that worried a little bit this spring about exactly where the starts are and the traffic is, that this is a phenomenon and a trend that's a little longer-term, takes longer to develop the communities. So does it feel a little more durable than maybe the more volatile housing statistics? Donald M. James: Well, I think, we take a fair amount of comfort in the fact that we're still plus or minus 1 million housing starts a year. And so the average over the last, whatever, 30, 40 years has been 1.4 million, 1.5 million. So we're -- housing starts, before they even get to a normalized run rate level, have to go up another 50%. And there got to be lots for those houses to be built on. So there's a lot of noise from month to month and week to week about housing starts and home sales. But when you back up and look at it over the longer term, we're very bullish on housing, particularly given our geographic footprint and the population statistics in our states. One of -- for example, the demographers are now saying Florida has now surpassed New York in population. So Florida has been very strong for us for at least the last 18 months in terms of recovery. It got hit, as you know, dramatically in the downturn. But I think, we are very bullish about housing and don't get distracted by reports about this, that and the other that come out every week about housing. We just think the long-term supply/demand in our markets is very favorable for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Vix [ph] with Jeffries. Unknown Analyst : I have 3 or 4 pretty short questions, hopefully. The first one was the states that had over 15% growth, I was surprised that Illinois was in that state, although you have referred to it briefly in some of the other comments. Could you kind of just summarize why you think that market is so strong? Secondly, I noticed in terms of leverage now, you're looking at net debt to EBITDA. Could you talk about where you'd be targeting in the longer term for that ratio to be? And therefore, give us some idea of the size of corporate activity that you might be looking at? And then, just finally, the ready-mix, obviously, was distorted by Maryland and Virginia, as you mentioned, but it's also distorted by the Florida divestment. Do you have any kind of like-for-like volume change excluding Florida you could give us for the quarter, and did it also have a significant impact on the ready-mix price? James Thomas Hill : Mike, this is Tom. I'll start off with Illinois. As I said in my comments, we have secured a number of very large projects in Illinois that will last throughout the year. So we're pleased with our performance in Illinois and confident that those markets will improve as the year goes along. Unknown Analyst : And there was no weather impact in Illinois? James Thomas Hill : I'm sorry? Unknown Analyst : There was no negative weather impact in Illinois? James Thomas Hill : There was bad weather impact. But the large projects, when they were able to ship, they shipped strong. John R. McPherson: I think, our guys on the ground are just doing a good job winning the work, too, and gaining share. Mike, on your question on balance sheet, we use any number of metrics, we just used this particular one to illustrate the improvement. As stated, our longer-term through cycle goal is to return to investment-grade metrics. It's really less about the metrics and more about the ability to pursue growth smartly throughout the entire cycle, which is what we're focused on. As we sit here today, our view is that we have plenty of firepower and financial flexibility to pursue those options that make sense for us and I think that's a function of both the balance sheet, but, Mike, also the really strong margins and unit economics that we're able to generate from the business, the strength of our operations and sales teams. So we don't see financial constraints in what we do, it's more a question of the opportunities and which ones make sense. Donald M. James: Mike, on your question on ready-mix, I think, John has already mentioned that our ready-mix in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, which is one of our best ready-mix markets, was down about 19% due to weather in the quarter. Everywhere else, we were up, on average, at least double-digits. California, Texas and Georgia. We had very good ready-mix shipments in the quarter year-over-year growth. We are projecting that our ready-mix segment becomes profitable in 2015, part of that is growth in margin and volume and price. Part of it is not having the Florida business as part of our mix going forward. So we think ready-mix will benefit greatly from the growth in housing, and to some extent, growth in private non-res construction. If you've been to Washington DC lately or -- you see huge amount of private non-res construction there in terms of office buildings and high-rise condos in the district, as well as in Northern Virginia, and that's a very strong market for us, all we need there is a little weather. John R. McPherson: Mike, just to give you another sound bite, the concrete businesses we retained, some asset that we've divested, would have been up on volume, I think, 1.4% for the quarter, and that's despite what is by far our largest position, Virginia, Maryland being down 19%. So the increases in the other markets are very strong. We have increases in pricing, increases in material margins across each of these businesses, and I think, all indicative of the recovery in private residential activity. So we're bullish on it. And obviously, the weather impact in Northern Virginia will reverse itself. I think, if you look at the gross profit mix relative to the expectations in our concrete segment for the quarter, it is almost entirely explained by the volume decline in Northern Virginia, which again, will reverse itself. Unknown Analyst : Is that a high-margin market for you? John R. McPherson: We have a very good position in that market. That's a good concrete market, arguably our highest-margin market. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Matt Brown. You may begin, sir. William Matthew Brown : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and welcome to U.S. Concrete's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Sandbrook, our President and CEO, to discuss the highlights of the second quarter of 2014. William J. Sandbrook: Thank you, Matt. As we reported in our earnings release this morning, we once again overcame significant weather-related headwinds to produce superior results in all areas of our business. June saw a 30% sequential decline in housing starts in the southern United States. The worst such monthly decline on record for that part of the country. Homebuilders attributed the decline to the region's unusually wet weather. Our Dallas/Fort Worth region, in fact, experienced the wettest second quarter since 2009. Despite this challenge, we were able to capitalize on our strong key market positions and robust construction demand. We reported strong growth in volume, pricing, revenue and profitability in both segments of our business, ready-mix concrete and aggregates. In addition, our continued focus on forward pricing and diligent cost management, once again, drove expansion in our materials spread and gross profit margins year-over-year. We are very pleased with our second quarter results and remain optimistic in continued improvement in the construction recovery we are experiencing in all of our markets. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Matt, to discuss our second quarter results in more detail. William Matthew Brown : Thanks, Bill. Consolidated revenue of $180.4 million was up 14.6% year-over-year for the quarter. Ready-mixed revenue increased by $20.9 million or 14.6% year-over-year, as we continue to show improvement in both volumes and average sales prices per cubic yard. Aggregate products revenue increased by $3.0 million or 29.5% for the same period. This marks the 15th consecutive quarter for which we have reported increased consolidated revenue on a year-over-year comparative basis. Ready-mix volumes for the quarter increased by 6.9% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Aggregate products sales volume increased by 20.9% for the same period. On the price side, we realized an increased on our average ready-mix sales price of 7.4% from $102.71 per yard in the second quarter of 2013 to $110.27 per yard in the second quarter of 2014. Our aggregates products average sales price increased by 7.3% to $9.63 per ton for the same period. Despite increases to our raw material inputs, our ready-mix concrete raw material spread increased by $4.31 per yard to $52.43 per yard in the second quarter of 2014 compared to 2013. This represents an 80 basis point expansion in our materials spread margin to 47.5% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to 46.7% in the prior year quarter. Our SG&A expenses decreased by $1.8 million during the second quarter of 2014 compared to the second quarter of 2013. The decline was due primarily to lower stock compensation expense in the current year quarter. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A expenses decreased 8.0% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to 10.3% in the second quarter of 2013. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased by 32.5% to $22.2 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $16.7 million in the second quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 12.3% for the second quarter of 2014 compared to 10.6% for the prior year quarter. Ready-mixed concrete adjusted EBITDA increased by 29.0% to $23.3 million, with a 160 basis point expansion in margin. Aggregate products adjusted EBITDA increased by 53.5% to $3.3 million, with a 390 basis point expansion in margin. During the second quarter of 2014, we had cash provided by operations of $8.2 million compared to $14.9 million in the second quarter of 2013. The decrease in operating cash flow year-over-year for the quarter was entirely related to changes in trade working capital and the timing of our senior secured notes interest payment. Interest on our new senior secured notes is paid semiannually in the second and fourth quarters of the year compared to our previous notes where interest is paid quarterly. For the second quarter of 2014, we spent $9.7 million on capital expenditures, up approximately $3.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2013. The increase in capital expenditures was due to higher spending on mixer trucks, ready-mix plant capacity expansions in California, and plant equipment improvements, all to support the growing demand in our markets. The book value of our long-term debt including current maturities was $213.3 million on June 30, 2014. This included $200 million of senior secured notes due 2018, $11.3 million of equipment financing for new mixer trucks and $2.0 million of other notes payable. As of June 30, 2014, we had 0 drawn on our credit facility, with $11.3 million of undrawn letters of credit outstanding. This left us with $110.4 million of availability as of June 30, 2014, compared to $67.8 million available as of June 30, 2013. Our availability is net of a $14.6 million availability reserve for outstanding letters of credit and sales tax reserves. We had $86.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet for total liquidity of $197.3 million as of June 30, 2014. Now let me turn the call back over to Bill. William J. Sandbrook: Thanks again, Matt. All of our regional markets remained strong with encouraging construction trends and robust backlogs supported by pent-up demand from weather in the first half of the year. Our ready-mix backlog at the end of the second quarter was 4.2 million cubic yards, which is 22% higher than it was at the same time last year and 5% higher than at the beginning of the year. In addition, our acquisition pipeline is steadily growing, and we have strong cash positions to execute on our development and expansion strategy. To wrap things up, we are extremely enthusiastic about our opportunities, both organically and strategically. The increased levels of construction and demand we are seeing in our markets, remain among the highest in the nation. The disciplined execution on our strategic plan should expand our vertical integration into aggregates and broaden our footprint in our existing markets, as well as other high-growth markets in the United States. We remain focused on capitalizing on these opportunities, which will continue to drive improvements in operating results and further enhance long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in U.S. Concrete. We look forward to reporting on our future successes. We would now like to turn the call back over to the operator for the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I'm showing our first question or comment comes from the line of Seth Yeager with Jefferies. Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research : Can you talk about, how has weather been subsequent to quarter-end in Texas? And what are the trends that you're seeing specifically, in that market on volume and pricing? William J. Sandbrook: The weather subsequent to the quarter had -- I would characterize as more seasonal than in the first half. I think it's been drier than the first half of the year, consistent with -- in July and August in the north Texas markets. The volume trends remain intact. As you've been reading from the other public company announcements, Texas remains strong, and we foresee that well into the future at this point by looking into our backlog. Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research : Okay. And maybe to follow-up on that specifically for Texas. One of your competitors mentioned a price letter that had gone out on cement that sounded pretty significant for next year. How observable are all of these increases? Obviously, your gross margins and materials spreads have seen a nice improvement, but are you -- at what point do you think you may start to see some pushback, if at all? Are more imports coming into Houston that may help offset some of these letters? William J. Sandbrook: I know that more imports are beginning to show up, however, it really doesn't affect us up in our markets, other than pushing fixed plant volume north. You know we are concerned about the magnitude of the announced prices -- price increases. Announced price increases and actually, effectual price increases are 2 different things. But I would like to comment on that a little more deeply. Our philosophy is that regular and responsible price increases throughout the entire value chain and in fact, throughout the economic cycle lead to long-term market stability and customer loyalty. And we're -- we will be in the process of aligning our long-term supplier base in all products with those that share that same responsible philosophy. Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research : Right. I appreciate it. If I back out noncash comp, SG&A fell below 8% of revenue during the quarter. You'd previously mentioned a target of 8%, so obviously, nice improvement there. Any updates to think about on the SG&A level, or should we see a little bit of less leverage going forward? Any comments there, please? William Matthew Brown : I don't think you'll see less leverage necessarily. We're actually hoping to get better than 8% as we go forward and actually revised our target of 7.5% of revenue for SG&A at this point. Since we've already -- actually achieved that this quarter. Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research : Okay. Excellent. And then last one for me, still sitting on a lot of cost from the bond offering. You mentioned the M&A pipeline being still pretty robust. Can you talk about -- what is your RP capacity for share buybacks? And just as far as acquisitions I mean, anything over the next couple of quarters that we can look forward to? William Matthew Brown : Yes, with respect to restricted payments and the share buybacks, we are fairly limited, particularly by the indenture and I'm not going to get into what that capacity is going to be going forward, but at this point we've used roughly half of our capacity there, based on one share buyback. So given, and as you mentioned the acquisition pipeline is extremely robust at this point, so the primary focus for us in using our cash is going to be on acquisitions as well as CapEx to grow capacity versus share repurchases. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question or comment comes from the line of Matthew Dodson with JWest. Matthew Dodson : Can you help me understand this TXI, MLM deal? Have you seen any more discipline in the Dallas/Fort Worth area yet? William J. Sandbrook: What do you mean by discipline, Matt? Matthew Dodson : In pricing. William J. Sandbrook: Well, they only took over at the beginning of July. And so, I think they're still trying to get their arms around organizational changes and strategies. I would anticipate that overtime, Martin will follow-up through with their strategy that they effectuate in other markets. I'd really don't want to characterize as it more or less disciplined than the previous TXI management, but I do think the Martin philosophy will be imparted into the TXI markets. Matthew Dodson : And how much exposure do you have of your revenue through that Dallas/Fort Worth market? William J. Sandbrook: On the revenue side, I would say, it's a little bit close to 1/3. Maybe a little bit less. Matthew Dodson : And pricing there -- you did 110 ASP in your ready-mix, what is pricing in Dallas/Fort Worth? Do you guys break that out? William J. Sandbrook: No. We don't break that out, and it varies from region to region and from project to project. Matthew Dodson : But is it fair to assume the Martin Marietta -- MLM way that you'd actually see price increase rise there? William J. Sandbrook: Well, I think in any market where you have some wins of consolidation, and remember the consolidation for Martin TXI was on the aggregate side because they weren't vertically -- Martin wasn't in cement or ready-mix in these markets. So there is consolidation on the aggregate side. I would expect to see increased pricing, but it's going to be difficult to assess if that's a result of Martin's philosophy, the natural integration and the microeconomics that ensue or it's just the relative strength of the overall Texas market. So it's going to be a little bit difficult to break that all out. Matthew Dodson : Got you. And then, last question. They have to sell, I think 2 or 3 plants in the Texas region, and I think they're aggregate plants. Are you guys interested in those plants? William J. Sandbrook: We would be interested in filling our vertical integration footprint in all of our markets, but I don't want to comment, specifically, on anyone. Operator : And our next question or comment comes from the line of Robert Donald with Stora Capital. Robert Donald : Just a brief, couple of questions. One is capacity. Can you just update us whether your mix or expansion plans have changed? And where are you right now a where do you expect to be by the end of the year in terms of the incremental change? William J. Sandbrook: On ready-mix capacity in our existing markets? Robert Donald : Yes. William J. Sandbrook: I would say, I've answered that before in the following manner, that we can expand our capacity based on our economic incentives i.e. pricing to have concrete customers except deliveries in off peak hours. How successful we are in that is relative to the contractor's needs, wants, and desires and ability to do that. Having said that, our demand is lumpy. We have significant excess capacity on, a rated capacity in some of our markets that does not have the velocity of volume, such as West Texas. And there's other places in the heart of San Francisco, in Downtown Dallas that we are stretched and are having to bring in product from a little bit more distant plants to satisfy the construction demands. And as I said in the first quarter, we have initiated and now, have completed a few plant capacity additions, specifically in our California markets, that would have added about -- probably an incremental 10% or 15% to our volume capabilities in the San Francisco/Silicon Valley area. Robert Donald : I think in the previous call, you kindly gave a figure of number of mixers that you\u2019re planning to expand under CapEx. I'm just really curious to know whether you have raised that aspiration or is it still the same figure. William Matthew Brown : Rob, it is Matt. No, we have not raised that since the last call. It's still approximately 80 trucks that will be added to the fleet. And I would tell you at this point, halfway through the year, we have added about 1/3 of that budgeted amount. Robert Donald : Okay. And just on the subject of the spread, which has being very reliable in the way that it's been improving. And in the Q2, it was a particularly strong sequential increase, I think it was over $2 per yard, which was one of the strongest sequential improvements. And I was just wondering whether that was skewed to any particular region, or would you say that was experienced equally across all of your geographies? And also, when you think about different clients between infrastructure, commercial and residential, whether it was also similarly experienced, or was there a big waiting effect that drove that in Q2? William J. Sandbrook: I would say, it's fairly equally spread across our sectors because our pricing strategies are through increased raw material inputs. They all have to be passed on equally in all segments. I would say that northern California had an outstanding performance, but the others were healthy as well. Robert Donald : Just coming back to the earlier question about raw material input pressures and your concern that the industry may go too far, too quickly. In that dialogue with your suppliers, do you feel that your ability to improve the spread from here is at material risk, or is it just a manageable challenge? William J. Sandbrook: I would characterize it as a manageable challenge. Remember, we're a national company with strong local footprints that have their own unique buying capabilities and capacities i.e. we're usually the power buyer in each of our regions, and we are not seeing the same degree of inflationary cost pressures across our entire footprint. So our risk is somewhat limited by that factor, as well as we have been successful in our pricing as you can see quarter after quarter after quarter, and I have no indication at this point that we won't be successful in going forward. Robert Donald : Right. And just [indiscernible] those imprints of the weather was rather challenging in Q2. Would you suggest that the sequential improvements in Q3 over Q2 should be slightly stronger than the normal seasonal effect because of that weather in Q2, or are we just saying that, that's a rounding error? William J. Sandbrook: I would, more assess it as a rounding error. Any of the volumes that would have been pushed from Q2 to Q3 will probably just end up pushing Q3 volume to Q4 because of the ability of contractors to get the work done. Operator : And our next question or comment comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli with Deutsche Bank. Sean Wondrack : This is Sean Wondrack on for Philip today. I just have a couple of questions for you. I think, building off the last earnings question, one of your peers alluded that the cement industry is experiencing increasing costs of approximately $25 a ton due to new EPA regulations and incited that to maintain margins, they need to increase prices 7% to 9% per year just to cover their costs. How confident are you that with these kind of robust supplier increases that you will be able to maintain margins in the medium term as housing continues to recover? William J. Sandbrook: Well, if you look historically over the past 8 quarters, we haven't had the raw material increases that have been announced to date. However, historically, raw material price increases that were announced were aspirational and in all likelihood, were never fully effectuated. So having said that, we have to discount a little bit the initial price letters. But nonetheless, we've been successfully in passing along and increasing our margins significantly, over the last 3 years and rising input costs, whether they be cement, aggregates, sand and gravel or add mixtures, traditionally, through the economic cycle, have led to increased pricing and increased margins for ready-mix producers. As long as the whole market is treated the same, these costs have to be passed on because nobody in the entire value chain, and including our concrete contractor customers, can afford the margin squeeze. So it's critical that they pass through the whole value chain, which historically, has happened. Sean Wondrack : Okay, great. And I had to ask, how much CapEx have you spent on mixer trucks year-to-date, and how much is left in fiscal 2014? William Matthew Brown : I would say that as far as how much is left, we have about $9 million left. As far as how much of that we actually buy, and becomes CapEx, and how much we lease, that remains to be seen. We like to preserve availability on our revolver by leasing. So given that the size of the acquisition pipeline is high, that's probably the route we'll be going at this point. The total spend thus far for this year on mixer trucks is about $3.2 million. Sean Wondrack : $3.2 million. And you said you've basically added about 1/3 of the amount. About 1/3, how many of those did you lease versus purchase? William Matthew Brown : That was almost all purchased so far this year. Sean Wondrack : Okay, great. And when you mentioned acquisitions, is there a ceiling to the size of an acquisition that you would do, whether that be leverage or a dollar value? William Matthew Brown : Well, at this point, if you look at our capacity, we basically have $197 million of liquidity in cash and the revolver. Beyond that, we have other avenues to capital, whether that's a tack-on to our existing notes or expanding the revolver. Those are a couple of the near-term ways we can do it, and we also have the alternative of using equity, either as consideration or doing an equity offering and using the proceeds for a deal. So I wouldn't put a limit, right now, on any type of acquisition kind of size. I would say that the deals we're looking at now range from anywhere from $1 million up through over $100 million. Sean Wondrack : Okay, great. And is there a net leverage target or a total leverage target that you wouldn't want to exceed with that, or it's not really as much of a factor, based on the quality of the assets you'd be purchasing? William Matthew Brown : Well, right now as of 6/30, our gross leverage is 3.6x and net leverage is about 2.1x. Longer term, we'd like to get down -- as those converge as we use our cash would like those both to be between 2x and 3x. Having said that, at this point, given the supply of acquisitions out there, you could see that go up to between 4x and 5x in the short term, as we do some -- those acquisitions, particularly the aggregates acquisitions which are typically at higher prices but also, increase your vertical integration and your margins. That's our plan at this point. Sean Wondrack : Great. That makes perfect sense. And just to clarify, when you say short-term, is that 2014, 2015 you're thinking or 2014? William Matthew Brown : That would be 2014, 2015. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have a question or comment coming from the line of Kevin Sonnett with RK Capital. Kevin Scott Sonnett - RK Capital Management, LLC: Was that 4x to 5x comment you just made net? William Matthew Brown : That would be gross. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions or comments at this time. So I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Sandbrook for any further remarks. William J. Sandbrook: Thank you, Andrew. Thanks, everyone, for participating in the call this morning and for your support of U.S. Concrete. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2014 results with you in November. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Bridget, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vulcan Materials 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Hill. Mr. Hill, you may begin your conference. James Thomas Hill : Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2014 results. I'm Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today is John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. We are very pleased with our third quarter results detailed in the press release. We're happy to provide additional color today and spend some time answering your questions. A slide presentation will accompany this webcast and be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call. Before we begin with the actual results and projections, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation. Now turning to Slide 3. We are pleased with our third quarter results and how we continue the strong conversion of incremental revenues in the growth in earnings. Revenues increased 7%, driven mostly by a 12% increase in aggregates shipments. Excluding revenues in the prior year associated with our divested concrete and cement businesses in Florida, revenues increased 15%. Our earnings leverage on higher revenues continues to be excellent. Gross profits and EBIT increased sharply, up 31% and 57%, respectively, due largely to strong earnings leverage in our aggregates business and flat SAG costs. On a comparable basis, earnings from continuing operations increased 93% to $0.54 per diluted share. Turning to Slide 4. Our third quarter results continue a trend starting in recent quarters, as shown in this table of trailing 12-month key figures. Over the past 12 months, aggregates shipments have increased 9% or $13 million tons, still well below normalized demand levels. During this time, we've leveraged a 9% growth in volumes into a 38% increase in gross profit and a more than 130% increase in EBIT. We believe we are in the early innings of demand recovery. As we continue to execute our sales and operating plans, we remain very focused on continuing the margin expansion you've seen us deliver in recent quarters. Slide 5 illustrates the volume growth in the quarter. The map depicts the 20 states we currently serve. You can see the geographic breadth of the year-over-year volume growth across our markets. Third quarter shipments grew 12% in total, and 10.5% on a same-store basis. Shipments in Illinois and Texas were up 31% and 21%, respectively, due in part to large project work. Other markets, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia reported volume growth between 10% and 15%. This strong broad-based growth is driven by improving private construction activity and our ability to serve growing demand for large project work in both private and public end markets, particularly large industrial projects along the Gulf Coast. Residential construction activity continues to be solid across our footprint. New lot development is increasing. While the growth rate nationally for housing starts has slowed in recent months, many of our key markets in Georgia, Texas, California and Florida continue to post above-average growth rates. Private nonresidential demand in our markets continues to grow faster than in the rest of the U.S. This is driven by office, commercial and manufacturing projects, and by significant growth in construction activity along the Gulf Coast. We are uniquely positioned to serve petrochemical plant expansions and other energy-related major projects. In the public sector, shipments for highways remains strong due to strong contract awards in 2013, increases in state highway funding and TIFIA-funded projects in key states. Additionally, the extension of the federal highway funding through May 2015 has provided more funding certainty to state departments of transportation. Given the strength of our strategic positions and our sales execution, we expect to keep outpacing the rate of volume growth of the industry overall. Our markets, despite recently reported double-digit shipment increases, remain far below normal levels of demand. Now let me focus on our success in converting these early gains and demand into expanding margins and profits. To cut straight to the headline, you'll see on the right-hand side of Slide 6 our gross profit per ton has increased $0.43 or 12%. Cash gross profit per ton increased to $5.15, a 7% gain over a year ago. Our local management teams are doing a great job of leveraging demand growth into even higher levels of profitability. So how have we done this? It's important to remember that our improving profitability in aggregates isn't driven by average selling price increases alone. At Vulcan, we commonly think of 3 major profit drivers that must be managed in combination. These are depicted on the left-hand side of Slide 6. First, price for service. Are we receiving full and fair value for the quality of the products and services we provide, are we helping our customers be successful, and are we getting paid appropriately for that help? Second, operating efficiency and leverage. Are we managing costs tightly every day, and are we using our assets and capital as well as we can? Third, sales and production mix. Are we producing what we can sell and selling what we produce? Are we managing inventories responsibly, and are we converting each ton that we crush into cash in a reasonable amount of time? We manage these factors locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly. This quarter's results, again, demonstrate the high quality of work being done by our local teams and our -- and their support groups. Despite a modest 2%, or $0.23, gain in average selling price, our gross profit per ton increased 12%, or $0.43. As I will touch on in a minute, the rate of growth in average selling prices will increase over future quarters. We already see clear evidence of that momentum. But in the early phase of the recovery, when price lags volume gains, it has been very important for us to grow unit margins faster than price. Now this is not a new story for us. You can see on Slide 7 that we have, in fact, compounded unit profitability faster than pricing since quarterly volumes began growing in the second half of 2013. During the last 12 months, our average unit price has increased 2.7% or $0.29 per ton. Over that same period, our gross profit per ton has increased 20% or $0.52 per ton. While I'm pleased with our performance, let me be clear, we're not hitting on all cylinders yet. There's a lot more margin out there. I'll refer back to the 3 profit drivers noted on the prior slide. On price for service. The expanding margins that we have delivered so far don't reflect the high- to mid-single digit price gains normally associated with cyclical recoveries. These should take hold in 2015. On operating efficiencies and leverage. While our plant managers and their teams have done an excellent job controlling costs, the fact remains that we are operating a capital-intensive production business at 50% to 60% of its capacity. We are well positioned to further leverage fixed cost sales. On sales and production mix. We've worked hard to maintain our core production planning and inventory disciplines throughout the downturn. As recovery continues, and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity, we will sell the entire product mix at full value. As we move forward into the recovery, we'll continue to manage and balance all 3 of these factors at the local level, and all 3 are improving. We're entering this upturn in demand with unit margins close to those that we enjoyed during our last peak, a time when we were producing and selling approximately 150 million more tons than we are today. We are confident in our ability to convert incremental shipments and revenues into expanding profit margins and returns on capital. Because of our improving margins, we have been able to deliver very good earnings flow-through. Our expanding margins per ton have allowed us to deliver strong flow-through to gross profit of incremental freight-adjusted revenues in our aggregates business. Slide 8 shows our incremental margin performance thus far in the recovery. By incremental margins, I mean the change in segment gross profit in our aggregates business divided by the change in freight-adjusted revenues, with freight-adjusted revenues defined simply as average selling price multiplied by tons shipped. This metric reflects the total gross profit generated for each ton shipped without the margin distortions of our pass-through freight revenues. To improve transparency for investors, we've adjusted our financial statement presentation. This should make it easier for you to compare our change in segment gross profit to our change in freight-adjusted revenues for a given period. For the third quarter, the incremental gross profit margin was 65%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in the third quarter of this year. Aggregates gross profit grew $39 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $60 million. As reported, and including acquisitions, the incremental margin was 58%, or $38 million of incremental gross profit on $66 million of incremental freight-adjusted revenues. As we've mentioned previously, quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime costs. For that reason, we're also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. As you can see, for the trailing 12 months the incremental gross profit margin was also 65%, adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregate gross profit increased approximately $118 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $182 million. We have included a table in the appendix of our slide presentation which illustrates how we calculate incremental gross profit margins in our aggregates business. We believe this type of gross profit flow-through is an advantage to Vulcan and its shareholders as volumes continue to recover, particularly given our strategic focus on the aggregates business. Slide 9 highlights some of the positive indicators we see in the marketplace. These contribute to our firm confidence in stronger price growth. This is demonstrated by the pricing momentum in key markets, where the construction recovery is farther along, and where we are already seeing robust price increases occurring twice a year in some cases. Aggregates volume and price have a lead-lag relationship. Price growth typically follows volume growth but with some delay. We are now coming into a more normalized pace in the cycle. We are also seeing a return of confidence for sustained recovery and that, coupled with continuing volume growth now for 6 consecutive quarters, will positively affect pricing power. Finally, we're seeing upward and broad-based pricing trends across our entire geography. These firming prices across the sector include price increases in concrete and cement. Putting it all together, the pricing environment is rapidly improving across all of our markets. We have the makings for robust price growth on top of continuing volume growth and margin expansion. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John for some comments before taking your questions. John R. McPherson: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll touch briefly on our nonaggregates businesses before turning to our full year outlook, and then a summary of our approach to capital allocation through the first 9 months of the year. Starting with Slide 10, we'll present the results from our asphalt and concrete segments. Earning results in each of these segments improved versus the prior year on higher sales. Asphalt gross profit improved $1 million due to higher margins and earnings from recently completed acquisitions. Asphalt volumes approximated the prior year but were short of expectations due to the delayed start of several large projects in California until 2015. Concrete gross profit was $5 million higher versus a loss of $4 million in the prior year's third quarter. Adjusting for the company's Florida concrete business sold in the first quarter of 2014, unit profitability improved and gross profit increased $3 million. Collectively, reported gross profit for our nonaggregates segments improved $12 million over the prior year quarter. Now turning to Slide 11 and our full year outlook. Our full year expectations for earnings growth and margin expansion remain basically in line with our plans, although we'll get there in a slightly different way. Aggregates volumes should come in a bit higher than our beginning-of-year expectations. And although our growth in average selling prices for aggregates has been modest, both our per ton margins and our incremental gross profit margins are in line with our internal goals. Our execution in this regard has been very strong, as Tom mentioned. As just highlighted, our gross profits from our nonaggregates segments had been at the low end of our beginning-of-year expectations, due in large part to delays of certain jobs into 2015. As a result, our overall external guidance for full year 2014 remains largely unchanged from August when we discussed our second quarter results. And as we often note, fourth quarter results can be significantly impacted by weather, particularly as we get late into the quarter. Now before I hit the highlights of our full year 2014 outlook in a bit more detail, I'd like to just reiterate and emphasize our view that the business has excellent momentum heading into 2015. The recovery toward more normal levels of demand for our products has a long way to go, but we should be entering our sixth consecutive quarter of meaningful year-over-year growth in shipments. Our unit margins are strong and improving but are yet to benefit from the accelerating gains in average selling prices that many expect over the coming quarters. And importantly, we have the organizational and financial strength required to invest smartly in growth at this point in the cycle. I'll now walk through Slide 11 for a brief summary of our updated full year outlook. For reasons of comparison, the format of this slide is the same as we've used in prior calls. I'll be brief, as we have, of course, touched on most of these items in our press release as well as earlier in this call. Since February, we have increased our outlook for aggregates volume to reflect stronger demand growth. That stronger demand, combined with strong sales execution, has resulted in our same-store aggregates volumes increasing 9% year-to-date. Assuming normal weather patterns, we expect volume growth in the fourth quarter of this year to increase mid- to high-single digits relative to last year's strong quarter when weather was unseasonably mild. For aggregates pricing, we expect full year pricing to be near the low end of our guidance range of 3% to 5%, with recent pricing actions having more impact on pricing in 2015 as opposed to the fourth quarter of 2014. For our nonaggregates businesses, we've narrowed our gross profit forecast from prior guidance of $40 million to $50 million to the current guidance of $40 million to $45 million, again, largely due to the delay of certain asphalt paving projects into 2015. SAG, excluding acquisition and divestiture-related costs, should remain in line with the prior year. We, of course, remain focused on leveraging SAG to revenues as volumes recover. Our interest expense forecast remains unchanged at $165 million to $170 million for the full year. This excludes onetime charges associated with our tender offer completed earlier. And finally, our capital spending outlook remains unchanged at $240 million. That to support improving demand as we look to 2015 and 2016. I'll conclude now with Slide 12 before handing the call back to Tom. On September 30, we announced that we had completed 6 acquisitions during the third quarter. You see these highlighted on the slide. Because cap allocation is an important area of focus for our management team at Vulcan, I'd like to take just a minute to place those transactions in the context of our overall approach to that topic so far this year. As noted in our release, Vulcan has generated approximately $890 million in cash year-to-date from operations and asset sales. Approximately $719 million of that cash is associated with the sale of our Florida area cement and concrete operations, the most volatile and capital-intensive components of our portfolio, to Argos. As a reminder, that transaction included a 20-year aggregates supply agreement. Given our aggregates-focused strategy, Argos was a better owner of those assets than we were, and we believe that transaction has been and will continue to be a positive strategic move for both parties. Now moving to the balance sheet for a moment. Year-to-date, we've paid down $516 million of debt. Our ratio of total debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA has improved approximately 3.6 versus a measure of 5.9 a year ago. Our overall credit outlook is solid and improving. These moves and the other actions we've taken to improve our core profitability put us in an excellent position to make the investments we made in the third quarter. We are well positioned both operationally and financially to grow our total profits and unit margins and, where the right opportunities present themselves, to grow our asset base. Now touching briefly on our third quarter acquisitions. In total, we invested approximately $320 million in attractive markets with which we are well familiar, as you see, again, highlighted on Slide 12. Approximately $275 million of the investment was cash, with the balance being in stock. Collectively, the acquired operations shipped approximately 8 million tons of aggregates in the most recent year, a figure we expect to grow in 2015 and beyond. And these transactions added 450 million tons of reserves to our portfolio. The integration of these operations has moved forward smoothly, a real credit to both our local teams and our shared support groups. The acquired operations will contribute incrementally to earnings in 2014, but should be accretive to EPS in 2015. As Tom has noted, our pipeline of potential bolt-on acquisitions remains very attractive. That said, we will remain disciplined in our approach to these investments, maintaining our focus on fundamentally attractive markets where we can establish a #1 or #2 position. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for a closing comment. Tom? James Thomas Hill : Thanks, John. We are pleased with our third quarter performance, and we're looking forward to the months ahead. We are very excited about the opportunities we see. Our recent acquisitions are already performing well. We're excited about the volume growth, pricing momentum and strong margin expansion we see across our markets. Our operations continue to run with great efficiency and are best-in-class in the industry. I thank our employees for their outstanding performance in these exciting times. I am very proud of our people, and our future looks great. And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Tom or John, I was hoping you might be able to touch on 2015 in a little more detail. I know there wasn't kind of explicit guidance. The commentary was encouraging or is encouraging. One of your big competitors kind of laid out a framework. I was wondering if you might at least speak to kind of an agreement on that and that was one that kind of pointed towards infrastructure being up mid-singles in '15, private nonres being up in the high singles and residential being up in the double-digit range. And to the degree you're comfortable just giving us a broad framework, could you maybe start there? James Thomas Hill : Yes, Ted. Right now, we're in the middle of the planning process for 2015. But let me give you a little bit of how we view it. We are continuing to see, as we stated earlier, lots of pricing momentum, demand continues to grow, our employees continue to give us great margin expansion. We continue to focus on those 3 profit drivers, sales and production mix, price for service and operating leverage and efficiency, and all 3 of those continue to improve each month. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. John R. McPherson: Ted, this is John. The only thing I think we'd add is we do -- we're not ready to give any explicit guidance, obviously, for next year, but we do continue to see all LNG segments up for '15 directionally. And I think, importantly, as Tom said in his comments, we believe our market will continue to grow faster than the industry as a whole. We like our geographic mix. They were more depressed than the market as a whole, and they're recovering faster than the industry as a whole. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. If I can ask a second, just I know at the end of your prepared remarks, you touched on the balance sheet, John, and I guess, exiting '13, we had you at about 5x leverage. On our numbers, you'll exit this year at about 2.5x, and exiting next year, we'd have you at about 2x debt-to-EBITDA. So a huge improvement and a lot of strength. Can you just talk about how you might redeploy that capital? And how you think about whether it's acquisitions or CapEx or buybacks or all the options, and kind of where you are at this point? John R. McPherson: Sure. First, I'll just say the obvious, which is how we think about capital allocation, how we think about return of cash to shareholders, how we think about our capital structure, all really important topics in a business such as ours. We're always evaluating a variety of different options. I think given the strength of our asset base, we actually have many options. I think what you can count on us for is to have a plan, not just to swing from one latest idea to another. More to the point on your question, I think we're very comfortable with the strength of our credit position and the financial position right now. I think we have several good options for the redeployment of capital through time. Certainly, reinvestment of CapEx into our business to support growth, but also to support the margin expansion to which Tom referred. I think we continue to see a pipeline of potentially attractive bolt-on acquisitions of a nature similar to those that you saw us complete in the third quarter. Always more difficult to kind of predict how those will turn out, though. And I think you'll see us, over time, have a balanced approach to reinvesting in growth and returning cash to shareholders. Now the exact form and timing of that return of cash is to be decided later, but I think you'll hear us talk about a plan for that approach. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : It's Matt Rybak on behalf of Jerry. To follow up on the capital deployment discussion, just wondering, are there any opportunities here going forward to set up on an MLP-type structure for a portion of your assets? John R. McPherson: I think anybody could see that our aggregates business and some of our product lines will likely qualify for MLP treatment. But that said, I kind of come back to my answer to Ted's question, which is we're always evaluating a wide variety of options for improving our capital structure and our capital costs. We think that's of critical important -- critically important part of our jobs. Those options could range from the mundane such as the ratio of fixed to floating debt in our portfolio to options such as MLPs that may be a bit different. I think the good thing for us is that we have a lot of options. We're very disciplined in how we look at them. And I think it's the kind of topic you should expect us to talk more about at our Investor Day. Not MLP specifically necessarily, but our approach to the capital structure and capital allocation overall. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And then turning to volume briefly. Just wondering if you can maybe say more on the cadence of volumes over the course of the quarter. We've heard that some highway job start dates have been impacted by the highway bill timing. September and October growth sounds like it was much stronger than July and August. Just curious what you've seen on that front? James Thomas Hill : We -- I think the only highway jobs that we had delayed were in Northern California for any significant volume. It hurt our asphalt volumes. Other than that, we've seen very -- we saw very good highway shipments in the third quarter. We continue to see very large highway jobs start to ship in 2014. Most of those will actually go in 2015. And with those, I'm referring to some of the TIFIA jobs like the Grand Parkway in Houston. We shipped a little bit of that this year, the majority of it will go next year. I-75, 575 in Atlanta, we have 1.2 million tons of backlog on that job. We will only ship -- we've not begun shipping. I think we'll start in December and probably ship 40,000 tons in '14, the balance in '15, '16. So -- then we've got the I-4 work in Florida, which is 1.7 million tons of concrete rock and probably 2 million tons of base and fill. That job has actually been awarded to the contractors, but the construction materials has not been awarded. So we'll, for sure, get part of that, but that will ship second half of '15 and '16. So we didn't see any slowdown in the third quarter, but we think it will pick up in '14 if weather holds, but for sure, in '15. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: First, on the acquired assets during the quarter, could you clarify the revenue opportunities for these? And what portion are plug-and-play versus others that may require a little bit more work? James Thomas Hill : Kathryn, would you -- I'm sorry, it's Tom. Would you repeat your question? Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Yes, on the acquired assets during the quarter, could you clarify the revenue opportunity for these? And what portions are plug-and-play, so really don't require as much handholding, versus others that require little bit more work? So just the understanding that it's not an even margin with all of the acquired assets. It doesn't have to be a specific dollar amount but just even a rough percentage in terms of understanding how much will require some -- a little bit more work to get up to speed versus others that are really good as a standalone right now? James Thomas Hill : Well, I think, if you look at those assets, we had a partial quarter in the third quarter with the assets. They were already profitable in spite -- accounting for marking up inventories to market levels. We expect they are -- all of those are tucked into existing markets, except for New Mexico, and the New Mexico market is a very attractive market when it comes to profitability. So we think we'll hit the ground running with them in 2015, and they will be accretive in 2015. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Okay. This is more of a Texas policy question. Could you provide any color on the impact of Proposition 1 referendum? And what that impact could be for TxDOT, if passed? And when would the dollars become available, if you have knowledge of that, if that referendum does, in fact, pass? James Thomas Hill : Yes. It will be -- and actually, let's cross our fingers because it's being voted on today. It is $1.7 billion of new funds. It's from the oil and gas taxes paid by the drilling companies from the state's rainy day funds. Knowing how TxDOT works, I would say that they would be, if it passes, they will be available immediately, but probably, you won't see that flow through to -- at the earliest second half, probably second half of '15. Those will be a lot of overlays because this is really driven by the damage to the roads with all the truck traffic, with all the big energy plays and drilling in Texas. So I would -- and I don't know this for a fact, but my guess is that those funds would -- you would start seeing volumes from that sometime second half of '15. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Right. And speaking of energy, are you seeing any slowdown in energy markets given the drop in oil prices? James Thomas Hill : We have not, and it's -- I think it's too early for that. But we continue to see that go very strongly, particularly the Gulf Coast projects. I think we'll ship about 500,000 or 600,000 tons on those jobs on the Gulf Coast in 2014. We'll see another -- I know we have another 2 million that we've backlogged to ship in '15, and there's probably, well on the books, on paper, there's another 10 million tons to be let. Now all of those -- probably all of those projects probably won't go, but even if half of them goes, it's a great shot in the arm for us. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: And just to clarify, those are more energy-related versus port expansion related to Panama Canal? James Thomas Hill : That's exactly correct. John R. McPherson: Kathryn, it's John. Just back on your acquisition question quickly, I think if you look at them collectively, the profitability of those businesses on a unit basis should match or exceed our company average once we get past the very early integration phase. And again, these are bolt-ons. There's not a tremendous amount of hard work to do to pull them into our business. Our folks are doing a very good job of that already. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Okay, great. And then final question on volumes. Just any more color on the type of projects you're seeing in Illinois and Texas? And what's the tail for these projects from a volume standpoint? James Thomas Hill : I think that, on Texas, we've mentioned the Grand Parkway, which is, I think, a total of 1.2 million tons. Of that, we'll ship 400,000 or so. We will ship 400,000 at the end of 2014. The balance will go in '15. Again, we mentioned the energy projects in Texas. I think that this proposition, you'll see a lot of big asphalt work coming up. I believe that will pass. And then we're -- in Texas, you're just seeing all markets hit, residential, nonresidential, all of them are hitting. In Illinois, we have a number of projects. At O'Hare Airport and the widening of I-90 have been 2 very large projects for us. But again, we're starting to see the residential and the western suburbs of Illinois start to pick up also. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Tom, you mentioned that new lot development is continuing to increase, and I wanted to drill in a little bit on that. I mean, how much of a pickup have you guys seen in sort of the lot development as opposed to just aggregates to build houses as the recoveries kind of crank on? James Thomas Hill : It really depends on where you are. In the more mature markets, California, Texas, Florida, parts of North Carolina and even Georgia, we're starting to see new subdivisions. And those are the places where we're starting to see the pickup. Kind of give you an idea where overall housing, we're seeing up low double digit, but if you look at specific markets and what demands happened in 2014 with aggregates, we've seen Los Angeles up 23%; San Antonio, up 23%; Dallas, up 18%; Nashville, which has been a little bit slower, up 12%; Atlanta is already up 15%; and then in Florida, Fort Myers is up 37%; Orlando is up 30%; Charlotte is already up 22%; and Baltimore is up 21%. So in those markets, where it's a little farther along, you're starting to see the subdivisions come in. Kind of the center of the country, we're still building out lots. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Got it, got it. And is it safe for me to assume that once you start getting those land development activities in place, they're a bit sort of longer tails and more steady than what might be sort of a bit more volatile kind of housing starts-driven stuff? James Thomas Hill : Yes, absolutely. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay, good. All right. Jumping around, looking at Texas, your volumes were up significantly in Texas. You didn't mention that as an influence on the average price. What does your price in Texas look like relative to the average? James Thomas Hill : Now Texas is -- the pricing has jumped already. It will -- we don't give specific pricing, but let me just give you an example on that. We -- and depending on the market in Texas, in October, we secured between $1 and $2 of price increase, and we'll see another price increase of April of between $1 and $2 depending on the market. So you can tell that where the markets, as we talked about, where the market recovery is more mature, we're seeing big price increases, and in some of those markets, we're seeing price increases every 6 months instead of every 12 months. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Is that across the whole state? James Thomas Hill : Yes. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's great. And just to sort of circle... James Thomas Hill : I mean, when I said across the whole state, each one of those markets is different, but all of them have sharp price increases, and they all have a lot of momentum. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Got it. Makes sense. Is it -- without trying to pin you down, was your average Texas price in the third quarter, was it above or below average? James Thomas Hill : Oh, it's well above. I'm sorry, Todd you mean, company average? L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Yes. James Thomas Hill : Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant price increase percentages. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : No, I'm sorry, yes. Just absolute price versus the company average price. John R. McPherson: I think, Todd, back to not pinning it down, I think it would have been offset elsewhere by other volume changes. So the geographic exception for pricing for us for the quarter was really Illinois-related. I think that's the best way to look at it. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then final one for me right now. Just looking at that Slide 5, where you sort of give state-by-state on the volume increases. Rural South Carolina is the one that jumps out as being the only one that's not green. What -- anything in particular happen there? James Thomas Hill : Yes, the guys in South Carolina are probably listening to this call hanging their heads, but it was only down 2%, and the impact was not so much demand. It was the fact that we had some very large project work last year that we don't have this year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Wanted to ask, Tom, maybe if you could provide some color. You're doing $3.93 gross profit per ton, up 12% year-over-year. How should we think about that going forward? And I just wanted to get a deeper understanding. You were talking about price for service, and it sounds like you have some good pricing power, and expect to see that in 2015. Does that imply that your 60% incremental margin can actually move higher if you realize that price? James Thomas Hill : I think, on average, we stick to the 60%. Obviously, price increases will help that. And, obviously, we're operating at 50% to 60% of our production -- our peak production. The operating leverage in the plants continues to get bigger. But I think over time, it'll shoot up and come back down, but over time, I think that 60% is probably in line with what our expectations are. John R. McPherson: I think one takeaway, Bob, is we have a long ways to go in the margin expansion and the positive flow-through. That story is still, just like the volume story, it's still in its early innings. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. But you're doing kind of margins consistent with where you were at 150 million more tons. So it seems like you've taken out a cost -- a lot of costs out of the system, and I'm just trying to figure out how to think about profitability, assuming your volume strength continues into '15. John R. McPherson: Well I think you're asking the right question. I'd encourage you to keep thinking about profitability on a per ton basis, and that's that way we present our financial statements. And that per ton profitability will, of course, be affected by pricing through time, which we're focused on every day, and we have some tailwind to there. It'll be affected by operating leverage and operating efficiency at our plant level. And it's, of course, also affected by a healthier product mix through time. I think all of those 3 things, we still have a long ways to go on. And our takeaway is that despite being, if you will, near previous high levels of unit profitability, we're nowhere near a cap or ceiling. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Got it. And then when you're talking about sales and production mix, is there -- what's the opportunity look like there from a mix standpoint if you get better demand across the product line? James Thomas Hill : Well, with new construction, you'll see an increase in sales for fines and base, which just allows us to sell the complete product split. And it just -- while those are low priced, they're very high margin, and they fill out our hand in selling the complete product line. John R. McPherson: You saw a little bit of that in the current quarter. Our product mix hurt us on average selling price, but we still drove significant improving margin per ton, and that was one of the factors in this quarter. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes, it's just tough to grasp externally a little bit just because of the moving pieces. John, just also wanted to understand on your guidance for 7% to 9%, what's -- on that 7% to 9%, what's the contribution from the recent acquisitions? So is that like 1 point or 0.5 point? John R. McPherson: You're talking about the volume guidance, is that right, Bob? Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : That's correct. John R. McPherson: I would think of a high end of that range on a same-store basis, so excluding impact of acquisitions for the year. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : So what percentage in the 7% to 9% should we attribute to acquisitions? John R. McPherson: 0. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : 0, so it's negligible. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : A question on transport costs. And the news here, back in the quarter, any impact we should? John R. McPherson: Keith, I can't quite hear you. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : I'm sorry. The question's on transport costs. Just was there any transport cost impact in the quarter? And should we expect any in near-term quarters? James Thomas Hill : We didn't see any impact from transportation costs, rail, barge or ship. In fact, they were -- rail was flat for the quarter, I think barge was relatively flat. John R. McPherson: Keith, and the way we present our financials, for freight-adjusted pricing and the way we flow that through, you wouldn't expect to have a significant impact for us the way we report our financials. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. But from a cash perspective, no impact in the period outside of your expectations? James Thomas Hill : No impact. Year-over-year, no impact. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Secondly, looking at, of course, we have another temporary highway bill taking it through the spring. Any new views there you're hearing, your trade routes [indiscernible] along the things of that nature? James Thomas Hill : Well, we continue to see growing bipartisan commitment for infrastructure. Last month, Senator Boehner urged President Obama to work with Congress in 2015 for both tax reform and a multi-year transportation bill. Leadership in both parties want to find funding solutions, and I think all of them are tired of going back to the general fund and getting embarrassed about it. Last week, we did have House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tour our Chula Vista operation in San Diego. And he -- while he was there, he stressed congressional leadership's intention to get a highway bill passed in 2015. So we continue to see momentum behind it. I wouldn't expect it in the lame-duck session, but we've got our fingers crossed it will happen in '15. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Does a Republican Senate help you or hurt you towards that goal? James Thomas Hill : I think, like I said, we're seeing bipartisan commitment, and I'm not sure if it helps or hurts us because they all want to fix the problem. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Just a couple questions left for me. One, you talk about the M&A environment, and you said some potentially attractive acquisitions. Can you talk about just kind of the valuations and how those are looking out in the market now versus what you've seen over the last few years? Are people starting to get a little bit more rational? Just any color you can give us on that, please. James Thomas Hill : Sure. There's a lot of activity out there, and we see a lot of opportunities. Now with that activity, there's a lot of them that are very unattractive. There are some that -- there are a lot of them that we're looking at for our footprint that make a lot of sense for us. I think they're fair deals, and I think they're also acquisitions that we can improve dramatically by fitting them into our family. But it is busy, and there's some great stuff out there, there's also some junk. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's fair. And I guess, just kind of on the valuation front. I mean, you got some junk and some others that are attractive, I guess, those are being priced accordingly then. John R. McPherson: I think, Trey, I think just a lot of this comes down to the reason -- a lot of the reason we're focused on bolt-ons is the synergies you bring to a transaction, which typically, we don't pay for in a deal. And I think if -- and we're not going to get into the valuations of the individual deals we've done. But if you looked at them all collectively, again, in the most recent year, producing 8 million tons roughly. That has a lot of growth behind it, at or above our per ton profitability as a company. You can kind of draw your own estimates for valuation collectively. Again, individual deals vary. But I think what really drives it from our point of view and we're very, very focused on is the -- is obviously, the synergies with the rest of our market positions. That's what makes it go from I've kind of got a good deal to a very good deal, and a lot of what will drive the accretion in the next year for us. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Got you. And Tom, you mentioned -- you touched briefly on some of these bigger energy programs down there, jobs that are being done over the next few years in the Gulf. What is the -- if you kind of look at that market, I know Texas overall is priced lower, but that market specifically, is that a higher priced market than Texas overall? And kind of how do we think of that from a profitability standpoint since that is one of your long-haul markets? James Thomas Hill : It is a very profitable business for us. The pricing has very much improved over the last 18 months. But it's also, you got to remember, we are in the unique position to service those out of Mexico. So we have a dramatic freight advantage, which improves our profitability to service those markets. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : That makes sense. And then last one's kind of housekeeping here. With the pullback in oil and just trying to get a sense for any kind of benefits you guys may see going forward, how much diesel are you guys using in your quarries now kind of post some of the recent acquisitions and divestitures and how that's moved? James Thomas Hill : I think one way to look at diesel may be to look at it on what happens to the per gallon cost of diesel because it's -- we've got diesel cost in quarries, we have it in asphalt, we have it in ready mix. But right now, a dime movement per gallon of diesel would mean about $4.5 million for us annually. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Quick question on the M&A environment. Do you expect to see more -- I guess, as more sort of the private smaller type transactions are out there, do you expect to see more downstream assets kind of like what you picked up in New Mexico as part of the deal on a go-forward basis? James Thomas Hill : Every one of those is different, and our focus is aggregates. We don't have any interest in picking up downstream unless it has aggregates attached to it. And when you look at those, some of those markets that have the downstream business attached to them, those downstream business are very profitable. And if they are, and we can -- we run them with a good return, we'll keep them. If not, we'll keep the aggregates and sell the downstream product lines. Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Perfect. And then I apologize if I missed it, but on Slide 6, you kind of highlighted the 3 profit drivers. Is there a way to kind of rank order them from most contribution out of those 3? John R. McPherson: I'd try -- I'd say no. I think the point is that you have to balance these and manage them in combination. And I think just the very heart of the business is you can't rank order them, you've got to make trade-offs at a local level between these factors. James Thomas Hill : I would agree with that. I would also tell you that as the volumes come back and demand comes back, and new construction, the balance between those 3 gets a whole lot better, and as so our unit margins improve. Operator : And we have reached our allotted time for questions. So I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill for closing remarks. James Thomas Hill : Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call. Have a good day. Operator : And thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Megan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vulcan Materials 2014 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Tom Hill, President and CEO of Vulcan Materials Company, you may begin your conference. James Thomas Hill : Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter 2014 results. I'm Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan. Joining me today is John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. A slide presentation will accompany this webcast. It will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call. Before we begin the actual results and projections, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation. Before we get into details today, I'd like to speak to you about some things that are immensely important to me and our management team. We executed well in 2014, particularly in the fourth quarter, and I am proud of our people and the job they did, but we are focused on the future. When I think about the job our people will need to do in 2015, 3 words come to mind : momentum, execution and discipline. Momentum. We are seeing accelerating momentum in demand throughout our markets. Demand in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations despite our California business being waterlogged, and recall that we are comparing against a strong fourth quarter in 2013. There is accelerating pricing momentum in many of our markets, and we are going to reap the benefits of that momentum. The momentum that we've seen thus far will carry forward through 2015 and likely well beyond, and we are going to take every advantage of it. Execution. Our teams throughout the company are executing very well. We are pleased with the results detailed in today's press release, and these outcomes directly reflect the great efforts of our people at all levels of the business. In particular, I'm proud of how our local businesses have continued to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit. We are servicing our customers well and helping them grow while operating our business safely and efficiently. Despite only modest gains in pricing so far, our people are making the most of this initial phase of recovery. They have set the stage for even stronger performance ahead. My personal focus in 2015 and the focus of our management teams will be on pricing improvements, margin expansion, smart uses of capital and safety. Discipline. We are very well aware that now is the time for continued discipline, not congratulations or complacency. Our people will continue to show great discipline in the delivery of quality products and services to our customers safely and efficiently, and we will emphasize continued discipline in how we deploy capital and in how we pursue price and margin improvement. We will be highly focused in 2015 on accelerating gains in pricing for our core aggregates business so that we earn a fair and full return on the significant investments that we have made in our business. We have made progress, but we are not where we need to be. It is also paramount that we continue our disciplined performance in operational excellence and cost control. We will remain extremely disciplined in our use of capital, deploying it to further build on our strategic base of world-class assets while improving our balance sheet and our return on shareholders' capital. The momentum, execution and discipline that were hallmarks of 2014 will be our watch words as we build an ever stronger business in 2015. Now let's move on to the rest of the call. You'll see that many of these slides line up with those used in our third quarter call, in large part because our focus on driving improved margins and fully capitalizing on the recovery in demand has not changed. The results on Slide 4 demonstrate the quality of our fourth quarter execution and how we continue the strong conversion of incremental revenues into growth in earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a 32% increase. We achieved these results despite a temporary rise in SAG costs as a result of business development and performance-based incentives. Our underlying profitability continued to improve significantly, whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.29, including $0.02 for business development expenses and restructuring cost. On Slide 5, you can see that our fourth quarter results continue the trend in recent quarters. Looking at full year results, we have seen a 38% gain in gross profit on an 8% gain in revenues. That significant increase is due to margin discipline, particularly in our core aggregates business, and the positive impact on the divestiture of our lower-margin concrete and cement businesses in Florida. SAG was up due to the items just mentioned. You will see later that we forecast a decline in SAG going forward. Adjusted EBIT nearly doubled for the year and adjusted EBITDA was up handsomely. For the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.91. Including the Florida divestiture and debt tender offer, earnings per share were $1.56. Now turning to our core aggregates segment. Slide 6 tells the story of volume growth across Vulcan's footprint in 2014. This growing momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity across all end-use markets and an increasing number of large projects, along with increasing highway demand. These trends gained further momentum in the fourth quarter, with shipments growing 15% in total and 12% on a same-store basis, even with the impact of bad weather in California and Georgia. For the full year, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Texas and Virginia saw shipments increase by more than 10% on a same-store basis. Aggregate shipments in California and North Carolina also realized solid growth. Shipments in Alabama and South Carolina were down slightly with slower recovery in construction activity in these states. Now let's talk about how we are converting this momentum and these early gains in demand into expanding margins and profits. Last quarter, we discussed the 3 major profit drivers that we can focus on. As you can see on the right-hand side of Slide 7, our industry-leading gross profit per ton increased $0.66 in spite of a modest overall price improvement of $0.21 per ton. Cash gross profit per ton increased to $5.18, an 11% gain over a year ago. Our local management teams are doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into even higher levels of profitability by managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, sales and products. This is not a new story for us. As you can see on Slide 8, we have compounded unit profitability faster than pricing for the last 6 quarters. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 2% or $0.25 per ton. Over that same period, our gross profit per ton has increased 18% or $0.52 per ton. Excluding our 2014 acquisitions, trailing 12-month gross profit per ton was up $0.56 or 20%. This is a higher figure than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are completely focused on ensuring that our unit margins continue to grow. In speaking to you last quarter about our incremental margin leverage, we discussed our best-in-class incremental flow-through that we enjoy with volume growth. Slide 9 depicts incremental margin performance in our aggregates segment. As you can see, incremental gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 79%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the year. Aggregates gross profit grew $45 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $57 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65%, reduced due to acquisition accounting. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime costs, we are also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. We'd encourage you to focus on these numbers. For the trailing 12 months ending this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was 66% adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $132 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $201 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our gross profit flow-through is an advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. Slide 10 highlights our asphalt and concrete results for the fourth quarter and full year. Earnings results in each of these segments improved versus the prior year on higher sales. Asphalt gross profit for the full year improved $5 million due to higher margins and earnings from existing operations and from the acquisitions in Arizona and New Mexico. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 4% from the prior year and unit profitability increased 6%, driving a same-store gross profit improvement of $3 million. Full year concrete gross profits were $2 million versus a loss of $25 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested concrete business, unit profitability improved and gross profit increased $6 million. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John for some comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John? John R. McPherson: Thanks, Tom. In our last earnings release and call, we placed emphasis on capital allocation, particularly with a view toward putting the recent acquisitions we made in the context of our overall approach and plans. The topic of capital allocation remains, obviously, a critical area of focus for our management team. And with that in mind, I'd like to now use Slide 11 to recap our actions during 2014, update you on the transaction we closed last week and highlight the goals and options we have in front of us. As you know, in early 2014, we successfully divested of our Florida area cement and ready-mix concrete operations to Argos. Given our aggregates-focused strategy, Argos was a better owner of those assets than we were. As a reminder, our divested cement and concrete operations were among the most volatile and capital-intensive businesses in our portfolio. We remain very pleased with that transaction, and it has positioned us very well for Florida's continued recovery in construction activity. Also during 2014, we further strengthened both our balance sheet and our core profitability. Our ratio of total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA has improved to approximately 3.3 versus 5.4 a year ago, and it should decline further with continued EBITDA growth in 2015. As Tom has noted, our core profitability, as measured by the cash gross profit we generate for each ton of aggregate shipped, improved another 9%, compounding prior year gains, and we expect it to improve further moving forward. As I'll touch on in a minute, we expect same-store shipments to grow approximately 8% in 2015, as the recovery in construction activity progresses. We are very comfortable, very comfortable with our credit position and how it is improving toward our stated investment-grade target. We spent $225 million on CapEx, excluding M&A, during 2014. This capital deployment not only maintains our physical plant, but also improves our efficiencies and ability to meet our customers' needs. We've now returned to more normal levels of what we call maintenance and enhancement CapEx, and we expect this use of capital to grow more in line with shipments moving forward. In 2014, we deployed $332 million of capital for targeted acquisitions that strengthen our asset base now and for years to come. We've made good progress with the integration of the 7 acquisitions we made during the year, and we expect these operations in total to contribute approximately $50 million to our EBITDA in 2015. And as we indicated we would, we began the process of growing our dividend as we grow earnings. Each of these actions contributed to the current and long-term value of our company. Equally importantly, they collectively improved our flexibility and optionality moving forward. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to sustain our capital reinvestment in our current asset base, to recover and maintain an investment-grade credit position, to accelerate the return of capital to our shareholders and to prudently pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions. To be clear, we will also consider additional asset divestitures and swaps. We believe it is important for us and for others in our industry to challenge ourselves regarding whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations. This logic supported our 2014 transaction with Argos, and it underpins the much smaller transaction we closed in late January. As noted in our earnings release, we recently concluded an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we've exchanged our Southern California ready-mix concrete operations for 13 asphalt plants, primarily in Arizona. Under the agreement, we will continue to supply aggregates to the exchanged concrete operations. Given its operations and strategic focus in these markets, each party should be able to earn a higher return on the exchanged assets than the prior owner. This exchange will be immediately accretive to Vulcan, and its expected impact is incorporated into our 2015 projections. Now let me turn to our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. I'll begin on Slide 12 with an overview of our outlook for demand for aggregates in the markets we serve. The headline here is that we see another year of high single-digit demand growth as recovery toward normal levels of construction activity continues. The pattern of the recovery is increasingly broad-based as we see growth in each of our primary end-use segments and in the clear majority of our geographies. And from what we can see, demand in Vulcan-served markets should continue to grow faster than the U.S. as a whole. We certainly cannot predict the future, but we currently anticipate a gradual recovery lasting several more years before we return to aggregates consumption levels consistent with long-term trends. As you can see on the slide, we see aggregates demand from private end uses up 14% to 18% during 2015. The growth in our fourth quarter sales to these end-users reflects the strong underlying momentum. Private growth continues to be driven by the recovery in employment and the continued recovery in single and multifamily housing. We see demand from public end uses in our markets up 3% to 5% during 2015. Construction award momentum remains positive and stable in Vulcan markets. The south and west continue to see more growth than other areas of the U.S. And as state and local tax revenues approach all-time highs, they should provide the support for new public infrastructure funding. Our 2015 outlook for these end-use markets, although tailored to our specific mix of geographies, does not vary significantly from the consensus of external industry observers. And finally I'll note that we have not significantly altered our 2015 demand forecast to account for recent declines in oil prices, the status of federal highway bill negotiations or shifting predictions regarding interest rates and credit availability. Certainly, these factors introduce a degree of uncertainty. But at this point, we see a continuation of the momentum witnessed over the past 6 quarters. As always, we'll monitor actual local demand patterns throughout the year and respond accordingly. I'll turn now to Slide 13 for a summary of our full year outlook. I'll be brief as we've touched on many of these items in our press release, as well as earlier in this call. We are, for 2015, giving a range for adjusted EBITDA, excluding any gains associated with the sale of property, of between $775 million and $825 million. I'll touch now on certain of the assumptions underpinning that EBITDA projection. We currently project 2015 aggregate shipments of approximately 180 million tons, consistent with the demand outlook I just highlighted as well as with the continued strong sales and customer service execution at the local level. On a same-store basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions made in 2014, we project shipments to be up 8% over the prior year. We currently expect average aggregate selling prices on a freight-adjusted basis to be up 6% over the prior year. As a reminder, our pricing decisions are made locally and outcomes will vary significantly by geography and at different points in the year. But as Tom noted earlier in this call, as well as in our prior call, we've seen the pricing environment continue to improve with the recovery in demand, and we remain intensively focused on earning a full and fair return on the investments we've made to serve our customers. We expect total gross profit for the aggregate segment to be approximately $735 million. Margins per ton should expand further as we work not only to achieve higher pricing, but also to leverage fixed cost and maintain strong production efficiencies and cost controls. Over the course of the full year, the flow-through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue to segment gross profit should remain consistent with recent trend, although as we've said, results will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. For our non-aggregate business segments, we expect gross profit of approximately $70 million in total. This projection reflects the impact of the asset swap I mentioned previously and includes approximately $50 million in gross profit from our asphalt operations, approximately $17 million in gross profit from our concrete operations and approximately $3 million in gross profit from our calcium business. Please note that the actual material margins and gross profit margins from these downstream businesses can vary substantially at the local market level and throughout the year. SAG expenses, excluding acquisition and divestiture-related costs and other items, should be approximately $265 million in 2015. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG to revenues as volumes recover. We expect DD&A for 2015 to be approximately $270 million as compared to $279 million in 2014. And we currently plan to spend $250 million for maintenance and enhancement capital in 2015, excluding our capital spending for acquisitions or a significant expansion of our distribution and logistics capabilities. Now a couple of final notes before handing the call back to Tom. First, I should remind everyone that the projections I just noted are certainly subject to revision throughout the year. While we believe our visibility to demand has been improving as we get further into the early stages of recovery, there certainly remains some uncertainty in the macro environment, whether due to oil prices, federal and state transportation funding decisions or other factors. That said, our focus remains on making the most of whatever recovery scenario we are presented with. Second, I'll note that our profit projections do not necessarily account for the full production cost benefits we may realize if diesel prices were to remain at current levels throughout the year. Our production budgets are built bottom-up, plant by plant, and our operators remain focused, as of course they should be, on the efficiencies within their control. We'll do our best to note the impact of shifting energy cost on our business as the year unfolds. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for a closing comment. James Thomas Hill : Thanks, John. We were pleased with our fourth quarter performance, but our eyes are on what's in front of us. Last year, we put down a solid foundation. Now we will build on it. We're going to be highly focused on superior execution of the business, price improvement, lowering cost, margin growth and capital discipline. The momentum that we found so encouraging in 2014 and that was so apparent in our fourth quarter results will only continue to grow. Along with accelerating demand growth, we're going to see accelerating momentum in our ability to secure price improvements and in our ability to continue executing on our first-class operational discipline, controlling and lowering cost. We fully recognize the importance of executing on price and operational discipline to give our shareholders a superior return on capital. And as I said earlier, we will continue to be extremely disciplined in our allocation of capital. Regardless of what the markets may do, we will stay focused on the things that we control, executing on price improvement and margin expansion. We'll also remain focused on servicing our customers so they continue to reap value from their relationships with us. Working together, we will win. I'm excited about our company and its future, and I look forward to continuing to report to you as we keep growing and succeeding in the years ahead. Now if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : I understood your commentary of not predicting the change in diesel, but obviously, it's in the news. I had 2 questions around that. If you could give us a rough idea in '14 how much diesel fuel you used? And then question two, if prices do stay down throughout this year, will that affect the price of aggregates in the market as the year progresses? James Thomas Hill : I'm sorry, would you repeat your first question? Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Yes, the first question, if could you could give us a rough number of how much diesel fuel you used in '14, gallons or something along those lines? James Thomas Hill : Total gallons we used in '14 was just over 44 million gallons. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And if we see the prices down the way they are now for the rest of the year, will that have a negative effect on aggregate pricing just around the shipping cost? James Thomas Hill : No, it won't have any effect on pricing. We've got a lot of pricing momentum. We do not price on cost. It's market-driven in the value of our products and the services to our customers. So the price of oil won't have an impact on the price of aggregates. John R. McPherson: And Keith, it's John. Also, keep in mind, we report freight-adjusted pricing, so the impact of diesel on shipping cost won't show up in our freight-adjusted pricing. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : I guess what I'm getting towards is this could be clearly a big benefit for you this year, again, if it stays down. Would all that benefit accrue to the bottom line or would there be some give back, whether it's around driver cost or anything like that? James Thomas Hill : I don't see any place we'd give back cost savings on fuel. I think when it comes to fuel, what we concentrate on are things we can control, which is using our procurement and management systems to buy fuel at the most competitive prices we can. And then we monitor fuel usage at every location, over 300 locations. We manage the tons per gallon of fuel we use so that we make sure that our equipment -- we're operating our equipment as fuel efficiently as we possibly can. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Final question on Slide 6, you have Texas as one of your really good markets here in 2014. We all know the questions around that. Can you give us any sort of scale for what Texas represents for the company? James Thomas Hill : Yes, first of all, we sell very little directly to the oil patch in Texas, so the immediate impacts, we're not going to see any. There is a lot of momentum in Texas, residential, nonresidential. Texas just passed Prop 1, which is an additional $1.8 billion to their highway funding, which is also right in our wheelhouse because a lot of that is focused on rural markets where we operate. We just think there's a lot of momentum there. At this point, we don't see anything happening for 2 or 3 quarters after that. I'm not sure we want to predict it, but there's a lot of folks out there predicting that. John R. McPherson: Quickly back to your first question on diesel and impact on aggregates pricing. Just a reminder that diesel is a relatively small portion of our total production cost, what, 7%-ish? James Thomas Hill : 7%. John R. McPherson: Right. So our biggest cost in our product is the stone, the assets, the quarries we own, and we price to earn a return on that. So minor fluctuations up and down in 7% of our cost isn't going to affect our pricing strategy. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: I appreciate your color on the 11% volume growth in -- for 2015. How much of the -- rough estimate, how much of the 180 million tons projected for next year are contributed from acquisitions? James Thomas Hill : I think that's -- hold on, I'll get that number for you. I believe that's about 7 -- between 7 million and 8 million tons. John R. McPherson: Kathryn, I'd say, without acquisitions, we'd be sort of in the 173-ish range, roughly. And where we've done bolt-on acquisitions, there's a little bit of art to what volume comes from the acquired asset versus what comes from other quarries in the same market. But roughly speaking, I'd point you back to that 8% same-store growth rate. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Okay, great. What is your -- you talk about return on invested capital in the earnings release. What is your bogey for return on capital? And what other mechanisms, above and beyond dividends, are on the table to return value to shareholders? John R. McPherson: To your first question, I don't know that we're going to give you a specific bogey. I'd underscore that our focus both now and long term is to earn a fair and full return on the full asset base, and particularly because we've made those billions of dollars of investment on behalf of our customers to serve them well. And so while we're pleased with our current results and pleased with the margin expansion and pleased with the outlook for '15, there's further to go on that, much further to go. And your second question was actions to accelerate -- what was it, Kathryn? Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Well, what other mechanisms, above and beyond dividends, are on the table at least to return value to shareholders? John R. McPherson: I'm not going to specify. I don't think we're going to specify any of that. That's really a board decision. But I think we'd be open to -- and have in the past as a company, deployed several mechanisms. So we'll have to think about that, keeping the cycle in mind. But I think we're committed to accelerating that return of capital over time. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Back to the fundamentals, some of the volumes that were impacted by weather or other project delays, how do they stand now and how should we think about modeling them into 2015? James Thomas Hill : They're in our -- those volumes are in our 2015 numbers. We knew that the projects in California were going to be postponed in the third quarter, and they're included in our '15 outlook. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Okay, finally. And my final question, I know that you don't have a significant amount of volumes that go specifically into the oil industry or the energy industry, but have you taken a stab at quantifying your best estimate of what percentage of your volumes specifically go to the energy industry? James Thomas Hill : Well, as I said earlier, very little goes directly into the oil patch. We'll ship over 2 million tons to large coastal energy projects in 2015. Those jobs are underway or getting underway. They won't be postponed. There's a few jobs that have not -- there's a few projects on the coast that we're hearing rumors of delay, but they would not hit until '16 or '17 anyway. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Quick question on the mix impact on price. And my call dropped off for a second, so forgive me if you guys did touch on this. But is that largely behind you guys or is there any anticipation that, that could creep into 1Q or any other period for that matter? James Thomas Hill : Well, I think the mix issue was we sold big projects in -- up and down the Mississippi River and in Illinois. While those were at lower prices, they were very good volumes. I think the fourth quarter headline pricing belies the pricing momentum that we're seeing across our footprint. If you kind of step back and look at pricing in the fourth quarter on a market-by-market basis, and we look at the markets where we're seeing higher growth or the recovery is a little more mature, and I'll read these off to you. We're seeing price increases in the fourth quarter 7.8%, 6.5%, increase of 5.8%, 5.7%, 4.8%, 4.6%. Now offsetting that in some of the markets where recovery is not as far along or where we sold some big basin finds job, we've seen price increases in the fourth quarter of 2%, flat, flat, minus 1% or minus 1.4%. And that's not all bad because if you look at the margin expansion across that same footprint, we're seeing nice margin expansion in almost all of our markets. So as far as pricing going into 2015, there's a lot of -- we're confident that the conditions and the momentum is there for good price increases. I'm focused on it. I think our team is focused on it. And we're secure about our pricing outlook for '15. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Great. That's helpful, Tom. And then my second question is a lot of talk, obviously, around infrastructure funding. The President's budget proposal called for an increase there again. I think the current bill expires in May, if I'm not mistaken. What are you guys looking for? I know you guys are pretty in tune with what's going on in Washington, what's being kicked around. What are you guys looking for if you were to take a best guess on how things shake out in May? And then as we kind of look into '15, any hopes for some type of a longer-term bill? James Thomas Hill : Yes, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum for a new highway bill. Leadership of both parties stated their intention to pass a well-funded bill. The timing, that's not clear. It may be difficult to get a bill by May, but -- and we may need an extension, but Congress has shown over and over again that they're going to fund the highway program, and so extension may have to happen and -- I mean, it will. The lack of a highway bill is not going to hurt us. The highway bill is not in our outlook. It could only help us. And we think there's a reasonably good chance of getting a bill in 2015. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : So then with your assumptions in guidance, I think you said public is going to be up 3% to 5%. What is the -- it sounds like you're going under the assumption there won't be a new highway bill in that, but what's driving the up 3% to 5% in a flat kind of funding environment that's in the guidance. James Thomas Hill : That's a good question. If you look at our -- we've got a number of very large jobs that we'll be supplying in '15, the Grand Parkway in Houston, 575 -- I-75/575 in Atlanta. So there are a number of very large jobs across our footprint that we started in '14 and will really kick in, in '15. But there's some other pieces of that. We've got 6 TIFIA jobs that will ship in 2015, be north of 2 million tons in '15 for those jobs. So you're starting to see the TIFIA program really mature from people talking about jobs or planning jobs to actually shipping materials on them. And then we've seen a number of state highways increase their funding. In Florida, Governor Scott announced a $10 billion highway funding bill for this coming year. Texas, as I mentioned earlier, passed Prop 1, which is an additional $1.8 billion. We've gotten more funding in Virginia. Georgia got a proposal for an increase of $1 billion. So the state funding is up on top of all of that. John R. McPherson: So Trey, one thing I'd -- just to point out on all of that is, our funding environment in our states, in our markets is not flat. When you look at the TIFIA projects, when you look at the rises in state and local funding, when you look at the rises in deployment of that funding to projects, our markets have funding increases consistent with our 3% to 5% outlook for our markets. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : First off, great quarter. That was very impressive both in terms of the revenue performance and profitability. Slide 8 caught my eye, you have a big improvement in rolling gross profit per ton on a 12-month basis. And I was hoping one of you gentlemen could kind of see the -- you posted $3.35 a ton, where can that go to in 2015 given the demand profile and the initiatives? John R. McPherson: Well, I think we expect to see, I'd say, 2 things. We'd expect to see our incremental margin on incremental revenue, freight-adjusted revenue in our aggregate segment to remain consistent with past trend for the next year. And along with that, I think you'd see similar increases in unit profitability. I come back to the point about earning a return on capital over time. We have quite a long ways to go in terms of margin performance to tie it back to the kind of returns on capital we'd like to see. So not only do we have room in '15, I think we have room for a very long time. You can go -- on a gross profit basis next year, I think if you work through the math, I think north of $4 on a trailing 12-month basis is sort of within our sights. And that's on a gross profit basis. On a cash basis, you could see north of $5.25. Keep in mind that our current levels of profitability, as Tom mentioned, on a unit basis are higher than they've been at the past while we're still operating at a little more than half the volumes we produced in the past. And with the kind of pricing we see in front of us, with the leverage of fixed cost we see in front of us, we're very focused on improving those numbers. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. That's actually what I was looking for. I just wanted to ask Tom, it seems like you have some good visibility on some heavy-tonnage jobs coming up, and I was hoping -- you already addressed kind of what you're seeing on the public side. What are your expectations for private nonresidential and private residential? And if I could just dovetail that, how confident are you in kind of the 8% same-store volume growth and the 11%? Is it more confident now than you were 12 months ago? James Thomas Hill : I think we're very confident in our outlook. When we do these bottom-up, our guys and gals come in each quarter in each market to build that volume up. As far as -- we had a very good 2014 in non-res. Some of that driven by traditional non-res, construction of office buildings, big-box, strip malls. On top of that, we saw the bulk from the large projects along the Gulf Coast. We'll continue to see that. There's a lot of confidence out there in the marketplace, both our salespeople and our customers for non-res. And as I said earlier, we -- our shipments to the large energy projects along the coast will be higher in '15 as those projects mature than they were in '14. John R. McPherson: Hey, Bob, as another reminder, Tom always points this out. But despite the good growth numbers over the last 6 quarters, we're nowhere near normal levels of demand or construction activity in the vast majority of our markets, nowhere near. So we both have a little bit better visibility. We've got good momentum, as you've seen in the last 6 quarters and the fourth quarter. But part of our confidence, as a reminder to folks, is we're still getting volume growth just out of recovery from a deep trough in demand. It's not predicated upon dramatic overall economic growth in the U.S. It's recovery of construction activity to things that begin to look like sustainable levels. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about costs in the aggregate division. Kind of appreciate that diesel is a relatively small portion of the cost, but we also are aware that the sensitivity of a 10% move in diesel is pretty significant. So as we think of potentially lower diesel, think about incremental margin, at least within your guidance, that's consistent with prior trends, are there any cost offsets to the potential diesel benefit, whether it's in blasting or explosives or contracting services or any other items that we should be aware of? James Thomas Hill : When we do -- first of all, when we do these plans, they're from a bottom-up perspective with over 300 locations across the country, so everybody's fuel is using a different fuel cost. Embedded in that is also off-road and on-road diesel, and that mix changes. So trying to get a solid comparison for a diesel price is really tough. Now there may be some savings embedded in it, but as I said earlier, our focus will be on the things that we can control, which is how we buy it, and buying it as economically as we can, and then how we use it, with measuring tons per gallon. So there may be some embedded there, but that's really hard to define and take apart across our footprint. As far as other costs or concern, there's always different commodities we use always. They do have price increases in a number of those. I think we also have the operating leverage, but I think we'll turn in -- continue to turn in improved pricing numbers as the year progresses. And I think our folks are really doing a good job at focusing on the key drivers of cost. Now you also got to remember, we're still operating at 60-some -- a little north of 60% of our peak volumes, so we've got a lot of room to be able to optimize our operations and our cost as volumes continue to grow. John R. McPherson: Hey, Garik, it's John. We don't -- there's only really one area in cost where I think we see a major trend that we're wrestling with, the guys wrestling with that jumps out. It's not a direct offset to diesel per se, but repair cost remain an ongoing challenge for us, not a major thing. That's something we're working on that ties to our CapEx focus over time, but we don't see major increases, I'm calling it inflationary increases at the moment. And keep in mind, we own our major input so... Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : My second question is on asphalt. Your guidance implies, I think it's about a 30% increase in profitability. Your volume guidance when we look at infrastructure demand for the year, low- to mid-single digits. That's strong leverage. I was just wondering, maybe if you can provide a little bit more color on the drivers behind the asphalt profitability. Is it more margin expansion of lower liquid asphalt cost or is it in the markets that you're servicing on the asphalt side, you're seeing accelerated volume growth or I guess conversely, is it the acquisition or the asset swaps that you engaged in that's going to be driving most of the profit improvement? James Thomas Hill : I think that -- we do have some improvement in our existing operations. There's a little volume there and some margin expansion, but the big jump there is with our acquisitions and the swap and the asphalt operations that we acquired. I think if you look at it, the asphalt business, we're going to show a gross profit improvement of about $15 million, about $12.5 million of that is acquisitions, about $2.5 million of that is improved volume and unit margins on our existing businesses. Operator : And your next question comes the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I was hoping to kind of focus on capital allocation and just kind of get a sense for how you'd encourage us to think about the dry powder you've got. I mean, to your point, John, you exited last year at about 5.5x leverage. This year, you'll be exiting at about 3. On our numbers, at the end of '15, you're kind of sub 2. And so I just want to kind of revisit how we should think about your targeted capital structure across the cycle, is kind of the first question. John R. McPherson: Let me start with where we are and then a couple of comments on the cycle. We'll probably touch on this topic more later. First, we're very comfortable with our current leverage ratio -- current amount of leverage. I think what we'd highlight is, we've taken a number of actions over the years to get ourselves in a position where we can, a little bit, do all of the above. So we can reinvest in our business as we need to, in our plant and equipment, in our asset base. We can achieve and maintain an investment-grade credit rating, which matters to us, so we have access to capital at all points of the cycle, to your question on the cycle; so that we can accelerate the return of capital to shareholders, whether that's through dividend or other mechanisms over time. So I expect you to see us have more of our cash flow each year go back to shareholders as part of the mix. And so we can still pursue prudent acquisitions and have a strong return, like you've seen us do in the last year. I think we've got ourselves in a spot, to your point on dry powder, that so long as we're prudent and cognizant of the cycle, we can do all of those things. In terms of how we think about it through the cycle, let me just say now, we're still closer to the trough of the cycle than anything that's normal. We think we've got several years of growth and margin expansion in front of us. And as we -- if we deliver a year, like you said Ted, per your model or your expectations, we're going to have a lot of options. And I think the good news is that we're going to have a lot of options. And we've worked hard to be in that position, but I think we'll have more options than, if you will, we'll have trade-offs. I think we'll be able to do, again, the right mix of all of the above. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe as a follow on to that, could you just talk about what the M&A pipeline looks like right now? James Thomas Hill : It's still healthy. There's still a lot out there, Ted, but I think the important piece of that is discipline. We have to be disciplined about what we're going to buy. We're disciplined about what we pay for it. And then as important as anything, disciplined about how we integrate it. And as quickly as we can, bring it up to the Vulcan standards of profitability and unit margins. So while there's a lot out there, we'll just have to make sure we're disciplined. I think we're pleased with our '14 acquisitions. And I think so far, we're very pleased with the integration and looking forward to their adding to our profitability in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners. James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Most of my questions have been asked, but looking into 2015, are there any regions which you're capacity constrained and utilization is higher than that average 50% to 60% you saw in 2014? James Thomas Hill : I wish we had that problem, no. As I said earlier, we're still operating 60% than where we were at the peak. We've got a long ways to go before anywhere we consider capacity constraints. James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. That helps. And then just a clarification. You paid down a lot of debt in 2014. What's your interest rate likely to be as you go -- or interest expense likely to be as you go into 2015? John R. McPherson: I'd say roughly $160 million, but I think you should expect us to continue as a company to take a hard look at our debt portfolio and its coupon cost and its duration and those kind of things, back to Ted's questions about some of the options we have in front of us. But if you're modeling, I think about $160 million roughly of interest expense, I think, and -- which is roughly consistent with last year. Part of our debt paydown last year was a use of proceeds from the divestiture of Argos. We're now in a position where, as I said, we're very comfortable with our current level of debt and our credit standing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I just want to clarify one of the things that you said earlier. And I've asked you this in the past, and I just kind of want to get your take on it. When you talk about your visibility improving as the demand grows, what does that mean exactly and how far out is your visibility? James Thomas Hill : Well, I think we're looking at 2000 -- what we're really talking about is 2015. And the reason the visibility gets better is, you're starting to see -- your backlogs are solid, you have confidence of jobs in your -- of -- coming up and your contractors and your sales force. You feel the momentum, for -- like example, in residential, you're not building out subdivisions anymore. They're starting new subdivisions, which are much more aggregate-intensive. So you just get a feel for the confidence and you start to see the jobs that you have secured much larger and more numerous. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then along those lines, if we were to get some sort of action from the government regarding a way to finance and finally pass a multiyear highway spending program, is it fair to say that the real benefit would start to flow through more into 2016, 2017? How do you think about what that would look like? James Thomas Hill : I think based on the timing, that's spot on. That where the bill has to flow through, you have to get jobs ready, so I think you'd be looking at '16, '17. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Quick question, just from a timing perspective with some of the weather issues last year, should we expect the cadence of the volumes through the year to be materially different or kind of more of a normal seasonality? James Thomas Hill : If I could predict the weather, I'd answer that question. The first quarter and the fourth quarter are always dicey. You just never know what's going to happen. What we were talking about in the presentation was, last year, our fourth quarter had great weather. It was really strong. So we were very pleased with the performance in this year's fourth quarter versus 2013. I don't know how to answer that except for, if you look at it, we just have to base it on normal weather patterns, which would mean the first and fourth quarters are always a little dicey. Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Fair enough. John R. McPherson: It's John, real quick. This is not quite an answer to your question directly, but it may be a related point, which I think there's historically been a tendency as you all model quarterly results to, if you will, over-model the first quarter. And just -- I'd just remind you that first quarter results, given typically low volumes and erratic weather, can be a little more unpredictable, whether that's a question on price or cost. So I would say that people often fail to understand some of the volatility that's inherent in our first quarter. James Thomas Hill : Well said. Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Very helpful. But as far as the SAG cost, we'll see some nice leverage in the coming year. But outside of acquisitions or incentive comp, is there any reason to think that, that number cannot continue to be leveraged on a go-forward basis into '16 and beyond? John R. McPherson: No, we fully intend to leverage that number in '16 and beyond. And Tom would say exactly the same thing. And when we took a bunch of actions to reduce our SAG cost, we worked hard to do it in a way where it can be leveraged going forward, including systems investments and other things we've done. So that is our intent and focus. James Thomas Hill : As John likes to say, we've been through that pain, we're not going back there. John R. McPherson: That doesn't mean the number won't go up some. But -- obviously, if our volumes grow like we think they will, but as a percent of sales, it should decline significantly over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : If I go back to your original comments, Tom, about momentum. Obviously, you are seeing momentum in volumes continue 2014 and 2015. You see a momentum in price sort of picking up 2014 and 2015. You talked about a gradual recovery lasting several more years. Can you give us some sense of whether you think as we look beyond '15, given that you don't have a crystal ball, but can you give us some sense of whether you think momentum can continue to sort of grow and rates of growth can stay at the levels they've been or even expand on price and volume? James Thomas Hill : As far as confidence beyond '15 and our outlook there, what gives us confidence is we're so far below the structural demand of aggregates, even with our outlook in '15. And for our country to stay healthy and strong like it is, that structural demand has to continue to grow or get back to more normalized levels. So a lot of confidence there. It's also the momentum you just see out there in all segments of the market. And yes, as far as continuing to expand margins, we plan on, as I said earlier, continuing disciplined execution of price and our operating disciplines. John R. McPherson: Todd, one of the focal points of our Investor Day will also be -- maybe to your question -- what's the earnings power of our business at normal demand and what are we planning to do to get there as a management team. So not to put off your question, but we will dig into it deeper when we -- in that setting. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Sure John, you can give me a preview right now, if you wanted to. I'll let you go on that. John R. McPherson: I guess, I don't want to, Todd. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Fair enough. I appreciate that answer. And thinking about the 2015 guidance, are there any -- where are the sort of points of sensitivity or push points in that where you could come out sort of above the guidance or below? Or put another way, what could happen this year to bring you in above your guidance or below it? John R. McPherson: I think, Todd, the official answer. One, I can't give you an answer on Investor Day early. Our guidance is our guidance. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay. Fair enough John R. McPherson: So I think your question within that, I think I'll just refer you back to some of our comments. We haven't tried to bake all the potential benefits of lower diesel prices into our estimates because we don't know what diesel prices are going to be. So that could -- for this year, that can swing a bit, obviously, in our production cost, as it did in the fourth quarter. So that's an example, but I think you could go through a lot of things and have an example. But that's one that's kind of outside our control, if you will, that we would think about. And again, for that reason, we didn't try and bake in some assumption that we can't control into our models. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets. Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Obviously, a lot of questions have been asked. I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the -- your gross profit per ton and the operating discipline you talked about. How much of that is volumes coming back and you guys just being prudent on adding back fixed costs? And how much of that is true productivity improvements you're making to the business? James Thomas Hill : I think there's a lot of that in true productivity improvements. As I said earlier, we're operating at 60% of our peak volumes, so you've got plants in some markets where we were having 2 crews run full plants, and there's just a lot of inefficiencies with that, along with a lot of fixed cost in these plants. We also need to go back and look at -- well, you can look at margin improvements, that mix, the slide that has the circles on it, it's a mix of price, of cost and then the blend of the products we're selling that give you the total -- the total maximized profitability of an operation where you make as much money as you can. And that's why we call it a local market, because just the plant manager and the salesman, they have to be there looking at their stockpiles, knowing what the market is going to have, where can they go with price, to put all that together to maximize profitability. Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up to that. I can't believe you gave as much color on incremental margins in '15, and you said it should be consistent with recent trends. Is there a point where that inherently starts to trail off, the incremental margins, either -- you've been talking about 3 years out, you'll be back to kind of normal aggregates volume, is that when you might see a trail off? James Thomas Hill : I think you got to go back to the fact that -- and this is -- and I keep repeating myself, but it's so important that we're still operating at 60% of our peak volume. So you got so much productive capacity that you will reap the benefits from -- as volumes go up, as far as being efficient in those operations. John R. McPherson: Just to clarify, by the way, I don't think we said that we think we'll reach normal volumes in 3 years. So we've got a good long ways to go, but we haven't given a prediction about that timing. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies. Michael Betts - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just 2 quick questions from me guys. Firstly, the SG&A going down slightly in 2015. I presume that the incentive compensation goes up again significantly, given the thought -- the increase in gross profit you're forecasting. What's bringing it down? I mean, were there some one-offs, I guess, I'm asking in 2014 or maybe a bit more explanation of what's bringing it down? And then the second and final question, assets held for sale, I noticed, were up $4 million to $5 million in the balance sheet. In your forecast for 2015, is there any assumption of higher ongoing quarry and land sales in 2015 than in 2014? John R. McPherson: Mike, I'll take a first shot at those. First on SAG, and I'll just give you a rundown of some of the kind of things we saw in the fourth quarter. A lot of it is business development-related, more than a couple of million dollars. We had some incentive comp that was really tied to our Florida divestiture and a gain on that sale as part of our system. So that's kind of a onetime event. We had a significant land donation, another $1.5 million roughly, which ends up as an SAG cost and then down as a gain on sale of land, so it negatively affects the EBITDA. We had other costs associated with the acquisitions we made. So a lot of the things that drove SAG were not repeating themselves. Yes, the core incentive comp, we'll keep an eye on as part of the overall business mix. But much of the factors driving the $8 million variance in Q4 and really the variance for the full year had to do with one-off or nonrecurring items. On your question about assets held for sale, I believe the answer, if you're looking at the same part of the balance sheet I am, is that those were held for -- that was the CEMEX swap. And that we knew we were working on that transaction, expected to conclude it. We concluded it in January. So at the time of the balance sheet, we were holding those assets for sale. Rough fair value associated with the asset swap for both sides was about $20 million, just to give you a sense of the size of the transaction, no cash involved. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I'm wondering if you gentlemen can talk about the cadence of pricing over the course of the year. You're exiting at 4%, guidance at 6%, can you get to that 6% in March, beginning of the construction season, or you're anticipating an acceleration over the course of the year? James Thomas Hill : Thank you. That's an insightful question. When you finish the year, outlook as an average of 6%, that will take some time to flow through. Normal cadence with that is to be a little lower in the first quarter and grow as the year goes along, and that's what we would expect. Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And in terms of just the additional price increases over the course of '15, can you talk about how many markets you'll be pushing pricing multiple times in '15 versus how many markets in '14 you were able to do that? James Thomas Hill : I'm not sure of that. We will push price in every market that we have and work on it hard. Normally, every market is different as far as timing and amount. Normal cycle with that is January/April in a lot of markets, but some you'll have midyear, and some you have in October. So it's really all over the place, but we'll work on it in every market that we're in. Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just following up to Ted's question, just related to the M&A pipeline. Any opportunities that you see for potentially meaningful asset swaps or how, I guess, intense are those discussions? Or was comment earlier, Tom, the fact that you'd like to see more of those? Just trying to gauge, trying to read your prior comment. James Thomas Hill : Well, I think what I was saying was that the pipeline has a lot of acquisitions in it, which we'll obviously have to be disciplined with. I don't know of any -- that I would be prepared to talk about any potential swaps out there. But again, we have to be picky about that. We have to be disciplined and be able to integrate them. John R. McPherson: Let me underscore, as we think about capital allocation discipline, it's not all about acquisitions, it's also sometimes about divestitures and swaps. And I think it's an important thing for the industry to stay focused on. Operator : And there are no more questions at this time. James Thomas Hill : Well, thank you for your questions. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to speaking to you at our next call and many of you at our upcoming Investor Day. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Tabatha, and I'll be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark D. Warren: Thank you, Tabatha, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Please note, a slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks by management and is available via the webcast. A copy of this presentation as well as a replay of the conference call will be available following the conclusion of this call at the company's website. Before we begin the actual results and the outlook, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom, you can proceed with the call. James Thomas Hill : Thank you, Mark. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring my confidence in our full year outlook. We're excited about the continuity and accelerating demand across our markets. We're excited about increasing pricing momentum, and pricing will continue to escalate throughout the year. We're also very pleased with our operating performance in the quarter. In spite of the difficulties posed by bad weather, our local teams did a great job driving incremental revenue to the bottom line, balancing price, volume, sales and production mix, along with operating efficiencies and leverage. The first quarter is always choppy, but we still saw healthy growth and good operating execution. Adjusted EBITDA was up 97%, total gross profit increased 128%, and same-store shipments increased 9%. Cash gross profit per ton increased 17%, with strong flow-through in aggregates gross profit, 68%, on incremental freight-adjusted revenue. Same-store pricing increased 4%, with strong pricing momentum across most markets. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. We are extremely well-positioned to achieve strong earnings growth in 2015 and beyond. Slide 3 shows the quality of our first quarter execution. It shows how we continue to convert incremental revenues into earnings growth. Total revenues, excluding freight and delivery, increased 8%, while adjusted EBITDA almost doubled to $77 million. This was due to strong earnings growth in aggregates and earnings improvement in each of our non-aggregates segments, while we held SAG cost flat. Our profitability continued to improve significantly whether measured by a margin percentage or per-unit profit. We achieved these results despite the prolonged bad weather in many key markets. Now let's look at our aggregate shipments map on Slide 4. I like the color of this slide. Momentum in shipments continue, with strong growth in key states such as California, Florida, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois. Volume in Texas was up 22% or 15% on a same-store basis, and North Carolina was up 29% despite bad weather. Georgia volumes were down due to extremely bad weather, but Georgia construction activity continues to heat up and Georgia is on the road to a very good run. Slide 5 shows the continuing volume growth across Vulcan's footprint. This momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity and supported by highway construction. It's occurring across all end-use segments. This is a result of the increasing number of large projects and growing highway demand as states ramp up their highway programs. Shipments grew 13% in total and 9% on a same-store basis in the first quarter, even with the impact of bad weather in the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and in Texas. The growth rate in aggregates volume on a trailing 12-month same-store basis has continued to accelerate, led by strong growth in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia, while aggregate shipments in California and Georgia also had solid growth. We continue to see healthy price growth, and pricing momentum is accelerating. We had a number of markets with high single-digit or double-digit price increases. For example, Miami was up almost $1.50 per ton; Tampa, over $2.40; Charlotte, over $1.70; Charleston, almost $2 per ton; and the Houston market was up $2; and overall, Texas prices were up over 10%. We did have some headwinds on both geographic and product mix, with high volumes in lower-price states like Arizona and Illinois, and much larger shipments of base and finds on new construction and large projects, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Now this is not a bad thing as the volume and product splits helped our overall profitability. We continue to see confidence in our customers' view of the market and their acceptance of price increases. There will be a lot more to come as we have secured April price increases in a number of key markets. For example, Texas, Georgia and Alabama all secured new increases of over $1 a ton in April. Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices -- as new price increases are initiated and realized on both fixed plant work and new bid work. The pricing momentum is what you have come to expect from our industry and from Vulcan. What we are equally excited about is our ability to take top line freight-adjusted revenue growth straight to the bottom line. In our last couple of calls, we've talked about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding margins and profits. On Slide 7, you can see our gross profit per ton increased 62%. So in the quarter, price was up $0.44 per ton, but gross profit was up $0.80. Our sales and operating teams continue doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into higher levels of profitability. They are the best in the business at managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product. This story of unit margin expansion isn't a new one for us. There's a trend here, not just a quarter story. As you can see on Slide 8, looking at this over time, we've continued to compound unit profitability faster than pricing. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 3% or $0.30 per ton. Over that same time period, our gross profit per ton has increased 19% or $0.63 per ton. This is a higher unit profit than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are still in the early stages of recovery. We are very pleased with this momentum. Demand for our products continues to accelerate, and I am extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth. Slide 9 illustrates our incremental margin performance in our aggregate segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the quarter was 68%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $31 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $46 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 52% as the gross margin on those revenues was impacted by acquisition accounting and seasonality. Since quarterly figures could be distorted by weather or onetime costs, we are also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was also 68%, adjusted for the same acquisition. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $148 million on incremental revenues of $229 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, gross profit flow-through is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. With Slide 10, we can step back and look at the big picture, seeing the significant progress in the aggregates segment of our business. Before the recovery began, our annualized volumes troughed at 140 million tons for the 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013. Since that time, we've added 26 million tons on an annualized basis. Nice, but still a far cry from normal demand. However, we've been able to increase segment gross profit by $216 million, with unit margins increasing 35%. Again, our people were executing on the disciplines that grow gross profit. These results also foreshadow the earnings power of our aggregates business as we return to more normal levels of demand and as pricing fundamentals begin to improve. Slide 11 shows our asphalt and concrete results for the quarter. Both of these businesses are improving on a same-store basis and as a result of transactions that we have made to improve our portfolio. Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was approximately $9 million, a year-over-year improvement of $4 million, driven by higher margins and earnings from existing operations. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 6% from the prior year. Unit profitability increased sharply. First quarter concrete gross profit was $1 million compared to a loss of $9 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested Florida and California concrete businesses, unit profitability improved dramatically. Gross profit increased $6 million. Now I'll turn the call over to John for comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John? John R. McPherson: Thanks, Tom. Capital allocation and capital efficiency, of course, remained critical areas of focus for our management team, and we gear our approach towards sustained value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to the allocation of capital across our business portfolio, let me remind you that in the first quarter we completed an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we exchanged our Southern California concrete operations for 13 asphalt operations primarily in Arizona. Vulcan will continue to supply aggregates to the swapped concrete operations, and you'll see a $5.9 million gain on this transaction included in this quarter's financials. We believe this transaction will prove valuable for both parties as each should be able to earn a higher return on the acquired assets than the prior owner. Now let me turn from business development activities to the ongoing management of our capital structure and capital costs. As part of our February 25 Investor Day presentation, we outlined certain actions intended to refinance near-term maturities, lower our weighted average interest expense and extend the overall duration of our debt portfolio. Slide 12 summarizes these actions, which are now substantially complete. On March 16, we issued $400 million of 10-year notes priced at 4.5%. This issue was very well-received, and the pricing reflects our now stronger and rapidly improving credit profile. Those funds, along with borrowings under an expanded revolving credit facility, have been or will be used for the refinancing of $620 million of maturities otherwise due between now and 2018, as well as 2 smaller notes due in '21 and '22, for a total refinancing of approximately $640 million. The left-hand slide of -- side of Slide 12 summarizes the relevant sources and uses of cash. And the right-hand side of the slide presents the relevant accounting charges, both the $21.7 million incurred in Q1 and the $46.9 million we project to incur for Q2. Now let me turn briefly to Slide 13 to recap the impact of these recent transactions on our overall financial strength and flexibility. Let me first remind you that we have maintained our overall level of debt at approximately $2 billion. We're quite comfortable with that level of debt at this time given our expectations for 2015 EBITDA and our strengthening outlook. Though we have improved the structuring cost of our debt portfolio, as you see on the slide, we now effectively have no maturities due before 2018 and a total of approximately $500 million due before 2020. By the end of this year, when we refinance our 2015 notes at maturity, we will have added a modest amount of lower-cost floating rate debt to our mix, a move which makes sense for our business. In total, our weighted average interest rate will have dropped by approximately 120 basis points to 6.5%. We expect to achieve credit metrics consistent with investment-grade benchmarks during the course of this year. And as our credit position continues to strengthen, we should have further opportunities to improve the overall structure and costs of our debt portfolio. We should also have the cash flows and the investment capacity needed to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareholders. Now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. As noted earlier and as you see reflected in our Q1 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan-served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. As outlined in our February call, we continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. The Federal Highway Program receives much attention at the moment and deservedly so. Like other observers, we expect an extension of the current legislation, during which time leaders in Congress will seek agreement on funding sources for a new long-term bill. Although several states have delayed work due to uncertainty at the federal level, we currently do not anticipate a major disruption to our projected volumes for 2015. In fact, given our current backlogs and the patterns of new project starts in Vulcan-served states, we remain confident in growing our shipments to public transportation and infrastructure end uses. Now the deteriorating state of the nation's transportation infrastructure and its very real cost to the average American family become more evident with each passing month. We believe that our congressional leaders understand this fact and we're hopeful that they will find a way to at least begin to address this pressing need. But amidst all this frustration at the federal level, there is some encouraging news at the state and local level. And with that in mind, we did want to highlight on Slide 14 some of the positive trends we are seeing at the state level for infrastructure funding. In general, state and local tax revenues have grown and mirrored the overall economic recovery. As state and local tax revenues approach all-time high levels, they provide stronger support for public infrastructure funding. Additionally, many states, and including several in Vulcan's service area, are tapping into other funding initiatives to bolster transportation and other infrastructure construction. At some basic level, this is a matter of responding to the demands of voters, servicing the requirements of growing population centers and, importantly, competing with other states. Our primary goal today is simply to note this important trend as it is one reason we remain confident that aggregates demand associated with public highway and infrastructure spending will at least continue to grow at a slow but steady pace for the next several years. To just briefly highlight a couple of very recent examples, I'll point to Georgia and Texas. Georgia very recently enacted new funding for its DOT, providing approximately $900 million in additional dollars annually, indexed to CPI and fuel economy standards, and a near doubling of the overall program. This legislation also eliminates or heavily constrains transfers of transportation revenues to other uses. This improved state-level funding complements the decision of several counties in Georgia to levy an additional 1% sales tax for local road funding. This is very good news for our Georgia business. In Texas, the State House and Senate each recently passed bills to increase transportation infrastructure investments further. Should final legislation be enacted along these lines, annual funding would increase by a projected $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This commitment comes on the heels of Proposition 1, approved by voters in November, and which directed approximately $1.8 billion in new funds to road repairs and maintenance. Again, these are just 2 examples of the type of action we're seeing across more and more of the states we serve. States recognize the federal program is necessary but not sufficient, and they are moving to tap new sustainable sources of revenue to protect those funds from being redirected to non-transportation usages and to invest in their future economic competitiveness. I'd now like to review our full year outlook, which you see summarized on Slide 15. We have not, at this time, adjusted our full year EBITDA guidance from the range presented in February. As we've noted many times, overall first quarter results do not always provide a reliable read-through for the full year. That said, the underlying volume and pricing fundamentals during the first quarter were certainly encouraging, and they underscore not only the improved -- the improvements embedded in our 2015 outlook, but also our longer-term targets. If diesel prices remain around current levels, we currently would expect to finish 2015 toward the high end of our EBITDA guidance range. In support of this of view and our overall sense of confidence and excitement, let me briefly walk through the assumptions underpinning our full year outlook. With respect to aggregate shipments, our 9% same-store growth in Q1 was on track with our full year outlook of up approximately 8%, despite weather deferring some shipments into later in the year. The gradual recovery in demand appears to continue across all end-use segments and across the vast majority of our geographies. We remain very excited about the continuing recovery in demand and its implications for our full year shipments. Moving now to aggregates pricing. The momentum we currently see is consistent with or trending ahead of our 6% outlook for the full year. As Tom noted, April 1 price increases appear to have held up well, and we expect to see more price improvement throughout the year. We remain confident in the 6% target, and we expect many of our markets to see price growth well in excess of that rate. Pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. In terms of overall gross profit for the aggregates segment, our local teams continue to execute very well, converting well over 60% of incremental freight-adjusted revenues into gross profit. Unit margins continue to improve and to improve faster than pricing alone would indicate. Diesel prices, as noted, have provided a tailwind and have helped offset certain costs inherent in meeting rising demand during often wet, cold operating conditions. We remain very confident in the full year gross profit outlook for the segment. Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability, both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisitions, divestitures and swap activity. These businesses remain on track to meet or exceed their full year gross profit targets, although we should note that margins in these businesses can be more difficult to forecast. And finally, SAG for the quarter remained flat to the prior year. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG expense to revenues as the recovery moves forward. All in all, our business is enjoying strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing very well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control. If history is any guide, we're likely to hit a quarterly bump or 2 somewhere on the multiyear road to normal construction activity, but the underlying fundamentals remain very exciting. With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments. James Thomas Hill : Thanks, John. We're very pleased with our first quarter performance. We're pleased with the accelerating volume growth, pricing momentum and strong margin expansion across the business. We're seeing growing construction activity in our markets. We have a lot of large projects already booked and more to come. Residential and non-residential construction in our markets is growing. And key states are also rising to the challenge of increasing funding for their highway programs. Meanwhile, we remain completely focused on the execution of the business. Price improvement, lowering costs, margin growth and capital discipline. Our teams all across Vulcan's footprint are doing that. We are very excited about the opportunities we see ahead of us and look forward to sharing the good news with you in the future. And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I guess I was hoping just to touch on pricing. I guess there's 2 elements to the question. One, we know reported was up about 4%. Can you talk about the headwinds and how we might calibrate around an underlying pricing number? And then the second question would be just kind of broader commentary, I know you mentioned that you're trending in line to above plan, which is good. But maybe if you could just talk about what you're seeing overall, and then if you could just compare and contrast kind of your results to kind of other data points throughout the quarter, that would be helpful just to get some context around Vulcan versus Martin and peers -- sorry, Vulcan versus peers. James Thomas Hill : Okay. First of all, as John said, we're on track, if not ahead, I think of our 6% pricing guidance. First quarters are always, as we said, choppy, and so we saw good price increases that stuck in January. We've had very good price increases stick in April. But when you look at the first quarter, it's really not a problem from a mix or headwinds, but it's more -- it wasn't just base and finds, it's also when you have real wet, really cold weather, particularly along the East Coast, you're not shipping to what we call fixed plants, which is your asphalt and concrete customers, which is some of our highest pricing or not very much compared to other jobs. So that's also a mix impact. But if you look at the underlying momentum of what's going in pricing, we have -- it's really going very well and we have a lot of confidence in where we see ourselves at the end of the year. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : And can you talk about kind of the range of price increases that you put in April 1? James Thomas Hill : Yes, it was -- in most places, it was around $1. Texas was higher. It was anywhere from $1 to $2. And that was the range. John R. McPherson: Ted, a couple of additional points and color to add, just to build on Tom's comments. I guess the thing we headline most is that we feel very confident of the underlying momentum, and the underlying momentum is obviously more consistent with our annual guidance than it would be the number you would see in just the first quarter. But a few other comments. I think -- and just because you asked, Ted, in comparison to other numbers, and let's just take Martin's number from last week, certainly, that's a very good headline number and we take it as another indication of the improving fundamentals in many of the markets that we serve. It's very hard for us as outsiders to make a true apples-to-apples comparison when you take into account freight impacts and geographic and product mix impacts, the impacts of the TXI acquisition and those kind of things. But that said, I think if we step back, our best guess would be that we're seeing many of the very same things. As Tom noted, our pricing in Texas for the quarter was up 10-plus percent. Our overall pricing outlook for the year, frankly, is roughly in line with Martin's new guidance, even though we don't measure pricing exactly the same way. Our flow-throughs, I think, were very consistent despite the difference in headline price numbers. So when you step back from all that, I would guess or expect that we see very much the same thing. And we, just to reiterate, again, confidence in the full year price outlook we've put out there, confidence in the trends, confidence in the ability to convert incremental shipments and pricing into gross profit and confidence in the longer-term fundamentals beyond just one quarter. What we're seeing in terms of volumes, what we're seeing in terms of price, what we're seeing in terms of margin expansion, all still on trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Just to circle back around to one question real quick and ask it in a little bit different way. Did you -- did I miss it? Or can you quantify how much you think you lost from mix on that price increase number? Or is it just more of a general kind of concept? James Thomas Hill : I think it's just really hard to do in the first quarter because of what I talk about, the mix effect of fixed plant versus just bid work, and that's really hard to pull out as opposed just base and finds. It's a big piece of where the clean stone goes and how much of it is in there. John R. McPherson: And one thing we -- to Tom's point, I mean, it's from a one -- from a first quarter-to-first quarter can be very difficult to make accurate comparisons. The momentum is obviously stronger than the 4%, as you can tell by our full year outlook. I'd also just note that despite the strong reported numbers in terms of shipment growth, we still had, by our estimate, something on the order of 400,000 tons in each of Texas, Georgia and Virginia deferred from Q1 and delayed a quarter due to weather. And a lot of that, as Tom mentioned in his pricing comments, was fixed plant business. So again, that's not abnormal for a first quarter. But given the wet days we had in those markets and given its impact and available construction days, not an insignificant impact in the quarter, both on volumes and, by extension, on pricing. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Got it. That's helpful. And sticking with pricing for one more, any plans for a second round this year, either in the summer or the fall, of increases? James Thomas Hill : Yes, you'll see a number of price increases go into effect midyear. You'll see some in October. And then as we bid work throughout the year, we will raise prices on the bid work. And as all work works off, it will impact pricing. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Great. Great. And then I want to ask kind of a general question. I think if the word for the day on the last earnings report was momentum, the word for the day this time is probably accelerating. And that's -- we would term that too in terms of price increases accelerating, volume growth accelerating. But I mean, when you think about the momentum and the business, and I know you've talked about this, but if you think about the momentum in the business, you think about the acceleration of the rate of growth here, what's that being driven by? Is that just sort of a -- you have mentioned large projects, but is it a little bit of everything everywhere? Or is there some particular end market or job type that you're seeing a lot of? James Thomas Hill : It's, as you said it best, it's a little bit of everything everywhere. All market segments are increasing. Now the private is moving faster than the public, although we've got very good highway jobs, big jobs in our footprint that we secured and also some very big jobs along the Gulf Coast. But it is absolutely everything and all -- it's everywhere and everything. I think large projects are just a piece of it, a very nice piece, but just a piece of it. L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Good. And, John, a final question just to nit. Do you have an outlook for interest expense for the year given some of the bond work that you've done? John R. McPherson: Yes, I think you can subtract the charges from interest expense labeled in the release. It's $221 billion roughly,$218 billion. And then you've got about a $69 million of charges that you could subtract out from that, that would give you this year's interest expense. But just to keep it simple, think about a 6.5% weighted average interest rate on a $2 billion debt portfolio. And so if you think about it for next year, you're looking at about $130 million, if you just take out the, I call it the messiness of this year. And obviously, we'll give guidance around that again as we get to next year. But think about $130 million as a run rate on the $2 billion debt portfolio as it currently stands. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : On your 8% organic guidance, I think you may have touched on this a little bit earlier, give as much detail of what you're expecting from the various end-user markets to make up that 8%. James Thomas Hill : Yes, if you look at the -- if you look at highway, we'd say low single digit. Infrastructure would be low single digit. Residential would be mid- to high double digit, and non-res would be probably mid-double digit. Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : And within non-res, a distinction there between manufacturing versus office and things like that, any view there? James Thomas Hill : Well, I think it's 2 things. It's your traditional non-res, which is office buildings, malls, buildings. It's also -- we've seen big growth in very large projects. As I mentioned earlier, the energy projects along the coast, we'll probably ship almost 3 million tons to those projects this year. And they're special to us because of our unique position in Mexico and our ability to supply those jobs via ships in the quantity and in the time that they need to be supplied. So -- and so that's not a 1-year play. We'll see that much volume or more in 2016. Those are also very, very profitable jobs again because of the advantage we have with blue water transportation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners. James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: The first, with oil prices remaining lower than last year, what are you seeing in the asphalt business? Are prices declining there? Or are you seeing any volume pickup from the lower prices? Could you help us understand a little bit of those dynamics? James Thomas Hill : We haven't seen any price decline at this point. There's other drivers on asphalt than just oil. It's a big one. But we have not seen pricing decline in asphalt. Always, lower liquid prices help, but that's -- that changes across our footprint. Remember, we're shipping asphalt -- we're making asphalt everywhere from Texas, all the way up through Northern California. So there's -- while overall, liquid has gone down, we've got some markets where it's not going down nearly as much as it has in others. Overall, though, I think our, at least in the first quarter, our profitability was up. We had good efficiencies in asphalt. We had good pricing. We had some headwinds due to weather, where it was cold. But so far, our -- we're pleased with our performance in the asphalt product line. James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then switching gears, could you just update us on the M&A pipeline? Is there any shift in the regions you're focused on, given the near-term dynamics? Or are you -- or is it pretty much as it was? James Thomas Hill : I don't think there's any big shift for the reasons we're interested in. There is -- there are some attractive things out there that we work on. We are also very pleased with the integration we've seen of what we picked up in 2014. Those performed well and on plan, even in spite of some seasonality. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : First off, you guys mentioned, obviously, weather kind of played a role in some of your markets in 1Q. But that should be -- that volume should be pushed later into the year. How quickly can you guys recapture that volume? And can you kind of talk about what kind of demand trends you're starting to see there through April and May? James Thomas Hill : Well, let me talk about the first quarter. What we saw there was when it was dry, our shipments were very, very good across our footprint. So there is a lot of pent-up demand. It will, as the weather falls, it will come back to us. It wasn't just -- in the first quarter, it wasn't just cold wet weather, it was prolonged wet weather. And so the times we did have dry weather, everybody showed up and it was there. So we expect it to return sharply. John R. McPherson: Trey, I guess the best answer, because let's not comment on specific quarters in terms of second or third, but we still have plenty of time in the year to recover that demand. And the way we think about it, our customers still have plenty of the time in the year to get that work done. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just geographically, are you guys seeing any shifts or notable trends geographically since the weather has started to cooperate? James Thomas Hill : I think what you're seeing is -- Texas is doing very well, but I think what you're seeing is the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic states really starting to pick up momentum. This will be a much better year in those markets than 2014 as demand continues to accelerate. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : And as we think about mix in light of that comment, is there any mix that we should be aware of, mix change that we should be aware of given the your geographic kind of outlook? James Thomas Hill : When it comes to mix, as the recovery returns, as we always say this, we'll see a more -- a bigger mix of base and finds, which is a very good thing for us, because overall, it adds to our profitability. But as far as our guidance on price, in spite of mix, we're confident in it. And I would also say that the return of new construction with the demand for base and finds is a very good thing for us. Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division : All right. My last one is, John, you mentioned earlier, and this is just kind of a point of clarity, that you don't -- you guys don't measure pricing exactly the same way as Martin Marietta, and I know it has to do with the way you guys look at freight. But can you clarify, just so everybody is on the same page here, what you meant by that comment, please? John R. McPherson: Sure. The way we report pricing is freight-adjusted. And so we take out the -- I think it was net of freight. So instead of reporting gross pricing to the customer, including freight charges that are effectively a pass-through, we report net pricing net of freight expenses to the customer, again, because we think, for us, that's a more accurate depiction of the underlying economics and it's the number we focus on internally as we manage our business. So if rail rates to our customers go up or if we have a broader mix of business that goes by rail or other long-haul transportation, it's not going to affect the net pricing number we report. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I wanted to ask you specifically about any weakness that you might be seeing on the energy markets or how you're thinking about that as the year progresses. James Thomas Hill : I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your question. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Can you hear me better now? No... John R. McPherson: Any weakness in the energy markets or do we see that... James Thomas Hill : No. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Yes. James Thomas Hill : We -- yes. I guess to answer your question, we don't ship much to the drilling -- to the energy market. When I say the energy markets, I'm talking about the oil patch, where they're drilling, where it's affected by the price of the barrel. So we wouldn't see it. We ship very little to that market. Now when you talk about energy when it's about the jobs along the Gulf Coast, which is the LNG jobs, refinery expansions, we continue to see that go very well. As I mentioned earlier, we'll ship over -- probably around 3 million tons of that for those jobs this year, at least that much next year, and we continue to see a number of those projects be bid and go through construction planning. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. So seeing that consistent, it sounds like? James Thomas Hill : Yes. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. Cool. And yes, I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about priorities for uses of cash in light of the options that you might have with your M&A choices out there looking similarly strong, just your priorities, if you could remind us of those. John R. McPherson: Just to give the quick walk through, and I'll start. Tom can comment. First, we're obviously going to continue to make the required capital reinvestments back in our franchise. And those protect the long-term health and value of our asset base, and they actually drive many of the productivity benefits you see in our quarterly results quarter-after-quarter. So that, for this year, that $250 million of CapEx, that's obviously a priority. We'll continue to do that in a very, very efficient way. But we're not going to shortchange our core asset base. It's too valuable. Secondly, as we've noted, we're going to maintain our financial strength throughout the cycle. Given the actions we've taken, that shouldn't be a significant use of cash in the foreseeable future. But I would call it out as something we're committed to maintain. Next, on dividends, this is obviously a board-level decision. But it's our expectation that our dividends would continue to grow with earnings, and we think earnings could grow quite quickly during the recovery part of the cycle. But again, that's a board decision that they will take in due course. Then we turn to largely bolt-on M&A, really of the kind you've seen us do in the last 2, 3 years. We think that's a very good use of capital, tends to have very good returns, both on a standalone basis and in terms of its impact on the rest of our business. And so as we find the right assets at the right price, we'll continue to pursue those opportunities. We work through all that and we expect that over time, we will still have some excess cash after all of those other uses. And as stated, we will look to return some portion of that cash in the recovery cycle, if not most of that cash, to investors and through a mix of dividend and share repurchase, but I'd say, primarily, opportunistic share repurchase will be our current thinking. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: First, just to touch back on base and finds that you discussed earlier in the call, could you clarify where you are in terms of working down the inventory of base and finds inventory? And what regions require greater work in terms of working down these inventories versus others? James Thomas Hill : Good question. First of all, I'd say that I think our operating folks and our sales folks did a really good job in the downturn of managing inventory, so we're starting from a pretty good place. As we do have some, I wouldn't call it a problem, by any means, but it sure does make your operations run smoother when you have large sales of finds and base. It just balances it out, makes the -- it lowers your -- actually lowers your cost and increase -- because it just increases your efficiencies in the operations. So not a problem with inventories, but it sure will be helpful as the cycle goes along to see those base-and-find jobs come through and go to the bottom line. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Are there any regional differences with the base and finds inventory versus any other region? James Thomas Hill : No, I don't think I see any big regional -- not that I can think of off the top of my head. I think we're -- like I said, we did a -- we took a lot of pain in the downturn to make sure we didn't have a problem with that, and I think, again, I think our operating people did a really good job of biting the bullet, so to speak, when times were tough to make sure we weren't left with a problem. John R. McPherson: And, Kathryn, well, part of Tom was referring to, and I think you understand this, is that we resisted the temptation. And this is the management team before us deserves credit for this, but we resisted the temptation to build inventory, if you will, to produce the profits as opposed to customer demand during the downturn. And so we've come into this in pretty good shape from an inventory point of view. And I think you see that in our flow-throughs and our incrementals. You see that in our results. So this is more about maintaining balance as we serve rising demand and as production ramps up than it is having any kind of problem. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Okay. Great. This is more a question related to acquisitions. Could you clarify the acquisition contribution in the quarter revenue, volumes, operating earnings? And maybe clarify a little bit more the delta between acquisition and incremental margins versus same-store sale metrics? James Thomas Hill : First of all, I think, the -- for the acquisitions, and this is not counting the divestitures of the concrete, the acquisitions EBITDA was around $5 million. And I would tell you that that's -- we're pleased with that based on the seasonality we saw and we still had the headwinds of some purchase accounting in those numbers, which hopefully we've worked through most of that. Our guidance on those -- or our outlook on those operations for the full year remains in plan. And I think we're pleased with the integration. Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Great. And on the -- I guess you specifically cited Georgia weather impact. Where in Georgia were you seeing a greater relative impact? And in general, when you talk about weather, which was cited several times in the release, was it later in the quarter? Was it more a product of precipitation? So first, specifically to Georgia, but then more broadly speaking in terms of that weather effect in the quarter. James Thomas Hill : I guess Georgia was all over, but obviously, the biggest market is Atlanta. And it wasn't a matter of how many inches of rain or snow we had, it was days lost due to wet weather. It was how prolonged it was versus the prior year. So it just shut us down longer than before. But I think we had, in Georgia, I think we had, for example, we had 10 more wet-weather days than we did in the prior year. John R. McPherson: And, Kathryn, that comes out specifically, as Tom mentioned again, in things like our shipments to our key asphalt customers, key fixed plan asphalt customers in the quarter, which are, I'm going to call it, were 400,000-plus tons, if I recall, below plan for the quarter. And that's kind of booked jobs, booked business, so you feel confident calling it out as something that -- our customers weren't able to do the work to get the crews out and so we deferred our shipment to them. Again, it's a lot of asphalt -- yes, a lot of asphalt business and some fixed plan concrete business, but primarily asphalt businesses around Atlanta. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Garik Simha Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : A follow-up question on the acquired assets. Just as you think out over the next 3 quarters of the year, incremental margins in the first quarter were soft for the reasons that you cited, purchase price accounting, seasonality, but is there anything within those assets that are fundamentally different from your, I guess, legacy assets that would depress or impact incremental margins moving forward? James Thomas Hill : No, I don't see anything different in those assets. They always take a little time to integrate and, again, we had some seasonality, but I see no reason that they won't perform fairly quickly, or at least over time, as our current assets do. Garik Simha Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then just looking at your volumes, very strong in the quarter. I get why you're hesitant at this point, early stage of the year, to raise your volume guidance. But can you just talk maybe about some of the, if any, risks that you would see to end-market demand, specifically which of the major end markets, if any, are you, I guess, less bullish on? Because the tone of the call, with the theme of \"acceleration,\" things appear to be perking up really nicely across your footprint. Is there any one area or, if any, that is cause for concern at all? James Thomas Hill : Well, obviously, I can't -- we can't predict worldwide events that may some catastrophic impact, but just assuming that all of that is neutral, I don't see any big risk. We've obviously got to go get a federal highway extension and a federal highway bill. I think there's very low risk that we -- that funding -- federal funding for highways is going to run out or that Congress will let it slip, in fact, a very low risk with that. But we still have to go get a long-term bill. While states, we saw, as John mentioned, a number of states are upping their funding and we actually see momentum with that, we're very pleased with it, states get nervous when there's not a long-term bill out there and they will start holding multiyear large jobs when they're insecure about the federal government's paying the highway bills. John R. McPherson: The only other one that I think we've talked about internally that jumps out, I'm just kind of thinking this was a good question, is Texas longer-term, with the decline in oil prices and we, of course, monitor it like anybody else. We haven't seen any impact yet, I think it's fair to say, particularly in our business, and you can see that in our Texas shipments this quarter despite a wet quarter in Texas. But that's one that obviously we, like other people, will continue to monitor just to see if that creates any dislocations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I'm wondering if we can just talk about what proportion of your markets do you expect to enter your price increase on April 1, and then maybe share a similar data point for July 1 or how were you thinking about mid-year. James Thomas Hill : Price increases, and we say this all the time and as we're not hiding behind it, but it's really true, pricing happens at different times in different markets, when I say that, even submarkets. So the pricing in -- for concrete rock versus asphalt rock in a market may be on different timing depending on the personality of the market. As far as April price increases, we had, as I mentioned earlier, we had price increases in Atlanta that went into effect in April. We had very large price increases in Texas that went into effect April 1. They were from $1 to $2, depending on where you were in Texas. And then we saw some price increases that went into effect in April in Florida. We'll see some more in different market segments in Florida mid-year. And as the year goes along, and as I said earlier, when we bid work, we'll continue to build price increases in that bid work on individual jobs, coupled with as you work off old backlog work, it will also give some momentum to price increases. Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just on the asphalt and concrete businesses, you folks have been pretty vocal with earning a fair return on your aggregates reserve and needing to get there. Can you just talk about how to get there in asphalt against concrete? Are you looking for outsized pricing to get there this year? Or is that a 2016 event? Can you paint the path for us for those assets? James Thomas Hill : Yes, if you -- let's take concrete first. And our pricing in concrete for the quarter on a same-store basis was up almost $7, so we're seeing good momentum in concrete with pricing. And as I talked about earlier, some momentum in not just the aggregates business, but across the entire construction materials segment, so as you see that momentum in concrete, cement, asphalt, and it makes it just that much easier for pricing to flow through with aggregates. So -- and we saw price increases across our footprint on a same-store basis on our concrete product line. When it comes to asphalt with -- you probably won't see a lot of big price increases in asphalt with the impact of liquid. But the profitability in asphalt overall was up sharply, probably over 30% on a unit basis in asphalt. So again, you're seeing the momentum when it comes to profitability and the downstream products, which sets the table for continued price increases on aggregates. John R. McPherson: And, Jerry, if you step back and think about our -- just our portfolio longer-term, building on Tom's remarks, our asphalt business has earned quite good returns on capital through the cycle. Material margins period-to-period can be volatile, but through a cycle, earn pretty good returns. In concrete, what we have left, the concrete businesses we continue to own, are doing well and earn good returns for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets. Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : I wanted to ask another question about your incremental gross margins on the aggregates line. The factors that impacted you in Q1, most of those were weather-related. I guess some were not. Have any of those negative factors carried into Q2? James Thomas Hill : I think -- I'm sure -- I'm not sure I understood your question. Would you repeat it? Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Yes, I mean, the incremental gross margins in aggregates were lower than you saw last year. And my question is, the factors that caused that to happen, did any of those carry into Q2? John R. McPherson: I think if you look at it on a same-store basis, the incremental gross margins continue to improve. So I think the key for you is probably look at it on a same-store basis to get an accurate read on the numbers. But if anything, we would expect our unit margins at our aggregates segment to continue to expand. James Thomas Hill : I also think -- you've got to remember, we've got a first quarter in there, which is, as we say, is always choppy. If you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, it's improving. Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. The price increases in Texas, you noted were a little bit higher than other places, but you also said you're watching Texas for potential slowdowns. So just curious why you're seeing stronger pricing trends there. James Thomas Hill : The demand in the market is more mature than other markets. It's just further in the cycle. It's actually foreshadowing what will happen across the rest of our markets as demand continues to recover. You've got to remember Texas never had the big fall that some of our other markets had, and then they were early in the recovery. They were bolstered with all the big energy plays. So the demand in Texas and where we are in the cycle is more mature than we are in other markets. So pricing should be ahead there. Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then lastly, we're 1/3 of the way into the year, and I'm curious on the private construction side, are you seeing demand that's in line with your initial expectations for the year? Or is it slightly better? James Thomas Hill : No, we're seeing it in line. We're actually -- we're seeing very good momentum in the private construction segment of the market. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Collin Andrew Verron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : This is actually Collin filling in for Bob. I just have a quick question on the public side. So in your presentation, you noted that the states have really been increasing their funding levels. But you have seen some projects being delayed. Can you discuss what states you've seen that in? And where you'd expect this -- expect to see this as uncertainty continues? James Thomas Hill : The projects -- the places we've seen projects delay because of the lack of a long-term bill are really in Arkansas and Tennessee and just really some large projects that they have. They haven't gone away. They just said we're not going to commit to them and put them out for bid until we have more secure long-term federal funding. Operator : And at this time, I'll now turn the call over to Tom Hill for closing remarks. James Thomas Hill : Well, again, we were pleased with our first quarter, and we look forward to the coming quarters and sharing our good news with you. Thank you so much for your interest in Vulcan Materials, and we look forward to talking to you over the coming months. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect.",

Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group James Armstrong - Vertical Research PT Luther - BofA Merrill Lynch Garik Shmois - Longbow Research Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Adam Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets Operator : Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company's Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Kayla, and I will be a conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Thank you, Kayla. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, President and CEO, and John McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Please note a slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks by Management and is available via the webcast. A copy of this presentation as well as a replay of the conference call will be available following the conclusion of this call at the Company's website. Before we begin, I refer you to slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the Company's SEC reports including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call Management will refer to certain Non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation. Now I would like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom? Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us today. Let me begin by thanking our employees for their outstanding performance in the second quarter. As you all know, weather conditions were unusually bad during the quarter with prolonged wet weather and serious flooding impeding construction activity in many parts of the US. In spite of these challenges, we operated safely, served our customers well and delivered strong results. The metrics and slides we'll talk about today are largely the same as in prior quarters. We are on track to have a very good year. Our focus hasn't changed and neither has our optimism regarding continued performance improvement. Construction activity and materials demand continue to recover. Pricing momentum is accelerating, and our employees are doing a really good job converting incremental revenues into incremental profits. Despite the bad weather in many of our markets we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring our confidence in our full-year outlook. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. As you can see on slide 4, adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations were $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of $0.30 from the prior year. Although overall average shipments were lower than expected due to weather, we continue to see expanding gross profit margins and expanding EBITDA margins. As you can see, overall gross profit margins increased by more than 450 basis points. These strong margins were supported by robust pricing momentum. We experienced strong earnings growth in aggregates and in each of our non-aggregate segment. This was also accompanied by declining SAG costs as a percent of sales. In spite of the weather challenges, our people did an outstanding job taking incremental revenue to the bottom line. As we've noted before, our local teams across our footprint are doing a great job managing sales and production mix along with pricing. At the same time, we continue to reap the benefits of improving operating efficiencies and resulting leverage. Total gross profit increased 34%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 33%. Same-store shipments increased 5%, and same-store pricing increased over 6% with strong pricing momentum across most markets. Our profitability continued to improve significantly whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit. Now, let's look at the monthly trend of our aggregate shipments and the impact of weather on slide 5. Rain in the second quarter reduced the number of available shipping days in key markets, and it certainly postpone shipments. Slide 5 shows the year-over-year change in monthly shipments. You can see the impact of rain on shipments in April and May up only 5% and 2% on a same-store basis. In April, it was pervasive across most markets with above average rainfall in 13 of our states. In May, severe wet weather affected plant operations and construction activity in Arizona, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. In June, with the important exceptions of Illinois and Virginia the weather allowed for more normal days of construction activity, and shipments were robust revealing again the momentum and demand. The map on Slide 6 shows a breakdown of 5% growth in aggregate shipments across the country on a same-store basis. Even with all the wet weather the vast majority of our states experienced healthy growth. Momentum in shipments continue with solid growth in key states, same-store shipments in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia saw shipments growth ranging from 5% to 11%. Although California volumes were down 3%, due to several large projects that had been delayed until the second half of the year, our full-year outlook for shipments growth in California remains unchanged. In our view and that of our customers' this is demand deferred not lost. I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 7, aggregates pricing. As we've discussed before, pricing growth tends to lag volume growth. We experienced in the second quarter the initial stages of this improving pricing momentum. We are pleased with the nice increase in freight adjusted aggregates price of 6.4% in the second quarter, and we fully expect to see pricing accelerate. This is supported by the confidence we see in our customers' view of the markets. We had nine major markets where price increases ranged from $0.60 to $1.20 and another three approaching the $0.50 range. In limited instances where we didn't see such robust pricing it was a function of product mix. We experienced much larger shipments of basin pines on new construction and large projects especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Growing volume in basin pines may detract from price but improves overall profitability. Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices are initiated and as we finish older jobs. At this point, we also expect second half price increases to exceed 8%. Pricing momentum for Vulcan will continue. We are focused on earning a good return on the significant investments that we in this industry make on behalf of our customers. We talk a lot about the three profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits, because they are important. On Slide 8 you can see that our second-quarter and trailing 12 month gross profit per ton increased 21% and 23% respectively. So in the quarter, price was up $0.71 per ton, but gross profit margin was up $0.76 per ton. Our sales and operations team continue to do an outstanding job turning demand into higher profitability. Nobody in the business does a better job of managing the combination of price, operating inefficiencies, volume and products. We continue to be excited about the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion for Vulcan. It's not a new story. As you can see, on Slide 9 we have now seen eight consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. Since our volumes began to grow in the second half of 2013 our gross profit per ton has increased sharply, and we are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations we're producing twice the volume. In the most recent quarter we saw an increase in repair maintenance and labor costs. This is not surprising. Growing volumes are requiring us to run our operations longer resulting in more repairs, and wet weather negatively impacts labor inefficiencies. This is something that we will be managing very carefully even as we see pricing momentum and continued unit margin expansion that more than offsets these costs. Even though we are still in the early stages of recovery, we are very pleased with this momentum. Demand for our products continues to escalate, and I am extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth. Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in our aggregate segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the second quarter was 74% excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $44 million on incremental freight adjusted revenues of $59 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 61% with a gross margin on those revenues impacted by acquisition accounting and weather. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or one-time costs we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12 month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was 72% adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $157 million on incremental revenues of $219 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. With that, I will now turn the call over to John for additional comments regarding our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John? John McPherson : Thanks, Tom. I'll start with Slide 11 which effectively serves as capstone to many of the metrics and trends Tom just highlighted. On this Slide, we summarize the improvement in our aggregate segment results since the recovery in volumes began in the second half of 2013. Before the recovery began, our annualized aggregates volumes troughed at 140 million tons. That was two years ago. As of the quarter just ended our trailing 12 month shipments are 170 million tons. So we've added 30 million tons of aggregate shipments on an annualized basis. This gain reflects a sustained early recovery but remains well below the shipments we'd expect under normal demand conditions. Now, importantly we've been able to increase segment gross profit by just over $260 million during this two-year period with per ton gross profit increasing more than $1 or over 40%. Certainly a central part of our strategic and operational focus remains on sustaining these trends and fully capitalizing on the continued recovery toward normal levels of demand for the materials we provide. Now let me turn to Slide 12 to briefly look at our asphalt and concrete segment results for the quarter. These businesses also performed well in the quarter especially given weather related challenges in Texas, Virginia, Arizona and New Mexico. Our local management of these operations continues to service customers well while also effectively managing material margins. And segment results for both asphalt and concrete have benefited from recent transactions that better focus our asset portfolio. Year-to-date the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plans despite weather related challenges. Looking at the asphalt segment, you see the gross profit for the quarter was approximately $21 million, a year-over-year improvement of $12 million driven by strong cost disciplines and margin management as well as the impact of acquired operations. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 8% from the prior-year, and unit profitability increased sharply. In looking at the concrete segment, you see second quarter gross profit was approximately $5 million compared to $3 million in the prior year as margin improvements helped offset the impact of work deferred due to weather including a record wet June in the Virginia, Maryland area where we have our largest concrete operation. Moving now to capital allocation, Slide 13 highlights certain second-quarter actions and updates consistent with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities and capital structure goals. These priorities and goals have not changed, and we continue to work diligently against them. First, we continue to make the CapEx investments necessary to sustain the long-term value of our franchise and to meet our customers rising requirements. Our core CapEx spending for the year remains in line with prior communications at approximately $250 million. In addition, we've committed to replace two of our three Panamax-class ships which transport product from our high-volume quarry in Mexico. The vessels being replaced have over 30 years of service each, and the advantages of our Bluewater distribution network easily merit the investment. We expect progress payments on the construction of the new ships to be approximately $36 million this year with another $85 million spread across 2016 and 2017. Next, we intend to maintain our financial strength and flexibility at all parts of the cycle. Consistent with this goal we've now completed the major components of the refinancing plan outlined during our February investor day and discussed at length during our first quarter call. These accomplishments include extending maturities on approximately $620 million of debt otherwise due over the next five years, establishing a new $750 million unsecured credit facility, and lowering our average weighted -- or lowering our weighted average interest rate. Our second quarter results include $45 million or $0.24 per diluted share of expense associated with this activity. In addition, we took steps in the second quarter to streamline our corporate legal entity structure. These actions improve our flexibility and reduce certain should of burdens, for example, significantly reducing the number of state income tax filings we prepare. We expect another outcome to be a more appropriate and efficient allocation of interest expense and overall taxable income across the states in which we operate. We currently anticipate a $3 million to $5 reduction in the annual state tax expense or an approximately 100 basis point reduction in our overall effective tax rate for 2015. In addition, we may be able to utilize over time all or a portion of approximately $60 million in state level NOLs which may otherwise have expired unused. Next, we continue to pursue bolt on acquisitions. During the second quarter for example we acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready mix operations in Arizona and New Mexico for approximately $21 million complementing our existing positions in those markets. The pipeline of bolt on acquisition opportunities remains active. But we will remain a disciplined buyer, and as such the number, size and timing of future transactions remains difficult to predict. As our performance improves, so does our capacity to return capital to shareholders. We continue to believe that we will have the ability to both reinvest for growth and return capital to shareholders as the recovery toward normal demand unfolds. Now let me take a couple -- now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and then our outlook for the balance of 2015 before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks and Q&A. As Tom noted earlier, and as you can see reflected in our Q2 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. Looking through the weather and the noise in Congress, we and our customers continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. Shipping rates on clear days underscore our recovery demand across geographies and across end uses. With few exceptions, construction activity in our markets remains well below long-term through cycle trends, but the recovery continues. That would be the main message here. Now to touch briefly on some of the underlying trends in private and public construction. With respect to private demand we continue to see manufacturing and other industrial related projects contributing to significant nonresidential construction growth. And as you probably know, housing starts despite month-to-month volatility continue to trend upward across most Vulcan served markets. On the public side, large projects have driven recent strength in Highway awards. State and local level funding initiatives support continued growth in road and other infrastructure spending particularly in the intermediate term. At the federal level, we remain optimistic that a multiyear bill may pass sometime in the fall. Tom will have more to say on this in a moment, but the need for a meaningful multi-year program is understood on both sides of the aisle, and recent developments have been well covered in the press. So to the extent we harbor modest concerns regarding our full-year 2015 volumes relative to plan, they primarily relate back to first half weather and the capacity of our customers to complete deferred work during the remainder of the available construction season. In several of our markets, key customers find themselves six or more weeks behind on scheduled work, and they face short-term challenges in adding the capacity required to catch up. In addition, the extension into the fall of uncertainty regarding the federal Highway program may impact the start date and timing of shipments to certain road infrastructure projects. Again, the marginal risk we see to 2015 shipment is one of timing and potential deferral into 2016. Now I'll turn briefly to Slide 15 and our outlook for the balance of the year. As noted in our earnings release, our full-year EBITDA guidance range remains unchanged at $775 million to $825 million, this despite the weather related challenges of the first half of the year. In short, we anticipate better than expected pricing and margin momentum to offset a potential shortfall in 2015 shipments relative to plan. The continued improvement in pricing and unit margins matches our strategic focus and bodes very well for the longer-term performance and value of our franchise. I'll now touch on certain of the modest adjustments we've made to assumptions underlying our full-year EBITDA guidance. As stated previously, please view these figures as indicative midpoints of our range of expectations. We want to give you a good feel for how we see the business performing, though we don't want to convey a false sense of precision regarding each and every metric. With respect to aggregates shipments, we've reduced our midpoint expectations for the year from 180 million tons to 177 million tons. This change reflects the challenges many of our customers face as they try to catch up with deferred work, the longer than expected ramp ups in production at certain of our acquired operations, and marginally higher uncertainty regarding start dates and shipping pace for certain large projects. Our fundamental view of the continued gradual recovery and demand remains unchanged. With regard to aggregates pricing, we've raised our midpoint expectation for year-on-year growth from 6% to 7%. As Tom noted, pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. We expect the rate of improvement in the second half to exceed that of the first half. At this point, we would expect these pricing trends to continue into 2016. Due to the potential shortfall in 2015 shipment volumes, we have slightly reduced our midpoint expectation for aggregate segment gross profit. We expect the rate at which incremental freight adjusted revenues flow through to incremental gross profit to remain roughly in line with recent trailing 12 month trends. Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisition, divesture and swap activity. As a result we raised our midpoint expectation for full-year gross profit from these segments from $70 million to $80 million. Our expectations for SAG, DD&A and CapEx remain largely unchanged. All in all, our businesses enjoy strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain very exciting. With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom. Tom? Tom Hill : Thanks, John. As John stated it we are confident in our full-year outlook. We are pleased with our team's performance in the second quarter despite the challenges of extreme weather. Our markets continue to improve in each market segment and across most of our geographic footprint. This growing demand is causing pricing momentum to pick up robustly which is clearly demonstrated in the second quarter results. I am confident in our employees' ability to execute on the disciplines of operating efficiencies that drive cost control and customer service that drives value and price all of which improve our unit profitability. We are very proud of our employees' hard work and dedication. We are also pleased with the level of activity on the Highway bill in Congress over the last two weeks. This culminated on July 30 in the Senate's passage of a new six-year bill the Drive Act. The Senate and house also last week passed a three-month extension to Map 21, the current bill. This will allow the house time to complete work on its version of the new bill. House and Senate leadership has stated their intention to go to conference with their respective bills and send a new, multi-year built to the President for his signature in the fall. This gathering momentum in Congress to address federal highway investments coupled with growing initiatives to improve roads in many states is very encouraging. We along with many other transportation stakeholders will continue to press for additional much-needed investments in America's aging infrastructure. As we look forward to the balance of 2015, and into 2016 we are excited about the accelerating momentum and demand in pricing and the improving execution by our employees. They are finding new ways to improve this Company and our profitability every day. Now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we will be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens. Trey Grooms : Good morning, guys. Tom Hill : Good morning, Trey. Trey Grooms : Tom, you mentioned accelerating demand. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color around what you are seeing in specific geographic markets now that the weather has started to cooperate. If you could kind of give us an idea more specifically there. Tom Hill : Overall we are seeing growth in all market segments as I stated and in the vast majority of our geography. About half of our individual markets we think will experience double digit growth this year. So all across the board we are seeing strong demand. Texas is probably the hottest market we have even with the impact of weather we saw same-store shipments volume up 8% in Texas. Florida continues to be extremely healthy. I think we were up some 11% in Florida for the quarter; Georgia very, very healthy. And actually Georgia got hit a little bit with weather, but there's -- that demand is just pushed back, and every time the sun comes out in Georgia, where shipping very strongly. So overall everything is -- the vast majority of the market is going well. If there is a spot that was a little behind the rest of the country I would say it was Alabama, Mississippi, that area. As I stated, California while the second quarter was a little slow because we had some jobs pushed back, and it may be a little bit behind the rest of the country, overall its demand growth is steady. Trey Grooms : Okay, great. Thanks for that color. You guys have been putting up some really good incrementals, great unit margins continuing to improve. Just wondering at what point -- I know John mentioned again, touched on the mid-cycle demand expectation of 250 million tons or so. At what point in this recovery coming off of 170 LTM tons do we start to see these incrementals start to slow down some or subside a little bit and maybe the unit margins start to slow with the growth there or improvement? John McPherson : I think as we talk about these same operations in the peak would've done 300 million tons, we're sitting at as we said 177 million so -- and we said norm was 255 million, so we've got a long ways to go before we start looking at any reduction in incremental revenue -- in incremental returns. Tom Hill : Trey, all I would add is that while in a few areas we are seeing some rising costs -- some trends in rising costs we are able to manage those so far. You see that in our margin performance. Our operator to local teams did a fantastic job. We don't see any immediate or near-term change in the recent trajectory but I would reiterate that our more long-term, through the cycle commentary and guidance on flow-throughs, is more on the order of 60% than the recent trends you've seen. But that said, don't take that as a signal that we expect some eminent decline in recent performance. Trey Grooms : Understood. And then on asphalt, very strong, the incrementals and the margins there tracking well above our expectations. Is there anything going on in the quarter there? Do you expect these trends to continue in asphalt? John McPherson : As the asphalt segment was up some $12 million, $9 million of that was on -- without the same-store basis. $3 million was the acquisition. So we are pleased -- you've got to remember a lot of that asphalt is in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona so they did have the headwinds of weather, so we're very pleased with our operating group being able to deliver value to our customers, manage material margins and operating costs and give customer service with all of that rain. That's tough to do. On top of that, the $3 million that improvement due from the recent acquisitions, we believe that that's a sign those have been integrated well and quickly. In those -- in that, we've got a lot of talent, that we are glad to add to the team. Both the same-store and the acquisitions we're pleased with performance. I don't see anything in this that would slow that down at this point. Trey Grooms : Thanks a lot for the color. Good luck. John McPherson : Trey and for others, just to remind people folks newer to our business, we tend to earn pretty good returns on capital in the asphalt segment through the cycle and over time, so we are pleased with those investments. Operator : Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Thompson : Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. First, is a clarification from acquisition contribution in the quarter both on a top line and a EBIT or operating margin -- operating earnings contribution. You may have had this but I may have missed it. How many tons of aggregates were acquired? Tom Hill : I think that the tonnage in Q2 from acquisitions was a little north of $1 million. If you look at the overall performance of our acquisitions, we are pleased with it. We had slightly higher costs that was due to two things. Remember a lot of those were in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, again, the weather issue which both dampened shipments and hurt us on cost. We also recognized in a couple of those operations that with some capital and some modifications, we could greatly improve our long-term product offering, quality of our products, and operating efficiencies. So you had those modifications in the first half of the year. I think those are starting to come -- we'll see the fruits of those probably in a quarter or two. But overall, I think we're pleased with it. We are on track to hit the plan that we had for EBITDA of $40 million to $50 million, and I think my folks have done a good job with the integration. John McPherson : Kathryn, just as a reminder for everyone, we acquired not only some aggregates operations but also some good asphalt and concrete operations. So in total for the quarter the revenue from those operations was approximately $50 million. As they get ramped up and as we put some additional costs into them as we ramp them up and I'd say ramp them up and as Tom mentioned hit some particular product needs of particular customer groups, the EBITDA contribution in the quarter was about $11 million year-to-date. About $16 million from those acquisitions and generally on track as Tom said with our expectations. Tom Hill : Let me correct one thing. That volume was just north of $1.4 million, I misspoke, in aggregates. Kathryn Thompson : Helpful color on that. In terms of aggregate pricing. We always understand since it's a local market, and it's -- also pricing can be vary widely according to geography and then also to mix. With that in mind, do you -- two-part question. One, with pricing accelerating as the year progresses, how much of this is a function of higher magnitude price increases versus a greater mix of higher priced markets finally gaining pricing? Thank you. Tom Hill : I think in all pricing was up in all markets except for Virginia. And that was really a mix issue. We had some very large sales of base and fines which as we say is a good thing. We like that. It actually improves our profitability. We are seeing robust price increases in most of our markets. I'll give you a little flavor on that. If you looked at South Carolina, Arizona, Alabama, we saw price increases from $0.40 to $0.50 in the second quarter. In the middle of the country which would be Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and Illinois, we saw price increases in the $0.60 to $0.75 per ton range. And then we saw in a few markets we saw some very marked price jumps in the $0.80 to $1.20 a ton range in California, Florida, Georgia and Texas. But overall our -- it's still a local business, and our local teams are working hard to make sure we deliver value and quality and service to our customers. I think we have a lot of confidence that the pricing momentum is across all markets, and we feel good about it at this point. John McPherson : Kathryn, I think those are the most important points. We haven't had much tailwind to pricing at based on geographic mix if that was your question. It's more prices across many, many markets improving. Kathryn Thompson : That was just to the point I was going to follow up on. Given you haven't seen a tailwind from geographic mix and you are also flowing through costs from acquired assets, you should see theoretically, all things equal, improving incremental margins as the year progresses. Tom Hill : All things being equal. Kathryn Thompson : Absolutely understood. Operator : Your next question comes from Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Ted Grace : Hey guys, congrats on a nice quarter. Tom Hill : Thank you. Ted Grace : I was hoping to follow up on Trey's question first on the demand side. Mother Nature wiling, we've got three to four months left on the construction season. To the degree you are comfortable framing out how you're thinking about the out year, it would be great just to get a sense for what the leading edge indicators are that you're looking at, how quoting activity seems this early looking out into 2016 kind of maybe quarterly business review highlights. Anything you can point to on that front that would be helpful handholding. John McPherson : Ted, this is John. Why don't I give a couple of numbers just to lay out a couple benchmarks maybe and Tom will add some additional market color in terms of what we're seeing from customers. All in all, we estimate that we've had about 4 million tons of aggregate shipments to start there deferred out of the first half. You can tell that we expect to catch up maybe about 1 million of those in the balance of the year, just by the change in our indicative guidance. A lot of that will, as you said, depend on Mother Nature and how long the remainder of the construction season is. And it really depends a good bit on how well many of our customers, and Tom can comment more, how much capacity they can add, and how much work they can just get done. To give you a rough sense of the 4 million tons we have seen deferred on the first-half roughly we'd expect to catch up about 1 million tons of that in the second half. That is less a function of any demands concern and just more a function of the time and capacity of our customers to get their work completed. Tom Hill : I think well said. Ted, as you said we probably have four months of solid season left. It will come down to constraints from contractors. Can they get in to get the job? How many ready mix trucks can they get? How fast can they get crews laying asphalt? But overall, remember this is work that we see if we don't get it in the third quarter, fourth-quarter this year it will follow in the first or second quarter of next year. So it won't go away. It's just postponed. And it's very normal when we have this kind of weather to see it push back, and when the sun comes out we are shipping hard. Ted Grace : Okay. So, maybe asked a little bit differently, if we were to think about the comments on a gradual recovery, normal recovery, would it be fair to think, at least the way you're thinking internally, is growth rates of end markets in 2016 could approximate 2015? Anything you might share on that end? John McPherson : Ted, we haven't giving any guidance, obviously, and we will do that at the right time but there's nothing -- overall across what is a fairly diversified geographic portfolio for us, we don't see anything at this point that would indicate a slowing momentum heading into next year. Ted Grace : Okay. That's really helpful. John McPherson : There are always state specific issues, right? But across the portfolio in total, although we're not giving guidance, we don't see any decline in momentum. Ted Grace : That's helpful. The second point of clarification, could you give us a bridge on EBITDA 2Q 2014 to 2Q 2015 -- I know there pricing is a tailwind, volumes are tailwind, energy is a tailwind, acquisitions are tailwinds. Can you just maybe help bridge it so we can understand the headwinds more granularly. I know R&M, labor was up, SG&A, a bridge there would be great, and I'll get back in queue. Tom Hill : Really I think the only headwind that we saw was probably (inaudible) was costs in the quarter was slightly higher. Labor costs, and I mentioned R&M were up. The labor piece, weather causes inefficiencies in the stone operation, actually ready mix and asphalt also, but -- so weather affected labor. It also affected the rest of our operating efficiencies and tons per gallon of fuel and electrical power. We are also beginning to run our plant with increased demand. We're starting to run our plants a little harder and longer. When you start to do this to start finding a few weak spots in the fixed equipment. We also took the opportunity in the second quarter when we were down to do repairs so R&M costs was up. But if you look at it from a longer-term view, our year-to-date cost is down about $0.10. On a same-store basis it's down $0.16, trailing 12 month is down $0.22. But the disciplines in operating efficiencies and operating costs is something that everybody focuses on every day. It is something you just got to stay on top of, or it will get away. I think our people are very focused on the things they control and the efficiencies in those operations. The headwind that I saw in the quarter was really one of cost and it was a mix of R&M and weather-related inefficiencies. John McPherson : Ted, if it helps at the gross profit line we basically as Tom was describing had a wash between some diesel benefits we had and other cost increases. So on a per unit basis that was cost structure basically a wash at the gross profit line so really the biggest bridge, if you will, of course, gets back to volume. And again if we had 4 million tons deferred out of the first half of aggregates we would estimate that's about a $35 million impact or so plus or minus at the EBITDA line. But the biggest factor in the quarter -- the costs were ultimately a wash, managed well. Volume of course is a headwind. If that's helpful. Ted Grace : I can get more into that offline. Thanks and best of luck this quarter, guys. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Armstrong from Vertical Research Partners. James Armstrong : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a good quarter. My first question, a follow-up on the asphalt segment. How much of the incremental operating margin was impacted due to oil prices, and if oil was a significant part of that, do you believe that you'll have to pass on some of that as the year progresses, or will you be able to maintain those margin levels for the remainder of the year? Tom Hill : There were definitely tailwinds with oil, but I think you have to look at it to separate that out when you're running over 50 asphalt plants and across the whole Southwest is really difficult to do. It's really a matter of managing the usage of oil with recycled asphalt products, recycled shingles each mix design maximizing it out and then maximizing operating efficiencies and the costs just to run the operation along with sales and service and value and price. So I think to try to separate that out is pretty tough to do. As far as giving that back, giving back any savings on oil, we don't see -- we don't see that -- those headwinds at this point. You don't know that for sure, but I think that right now we're pretty confident in our ability to manage the combination of customer service material margin operating costs and continue what we're doing today. James Armstrong : Thank you. And then on the aggregate segment as we go into the back half of the year, have the regions in which you are seeing pricing momentum changed from what you saw in the first half of the year, and can you detail that a little bit more for us? Tom Hill : I don't know that anything has changed as far as the momentum we see in the pricing. Obviously, the margins that are more mature in the recovery margins because price lags volume are seeing the bigger jump in pricing. But overall I think the trend is pretty steady. I think it will continue. Not only is it steady, but it will continue to improve as we go forward and as we said earlier, we'll be back half loaded with a price improvement. John McPherson : The range varies substantially across markets but I think to come back to what Tom said, I think all of our states saw pricing increase in the same-store basis at some level. So a trend if we went back a few quarters would be that it's broadening. The rates vary substantially across states, but the trend would be that it's been broadening. James Armstrong : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. PT Luther : Hi, John, it's actually PT Luther in for Timna today. You made some pretty universally positive comments in terms of demand trends. I just wanted to check and see if you are seeing much leakage just from the weaker energy markets in any of your -- among any of your customers maybe in LNG projects things like that. Tom Hill : If you look at the energy projects along the coast, the LNG projects, the refinery projects we are actually seeing that continue to pick up. My guess is we'll ship over 2 million tons to that segment on the coast. Remember, the reason why we are so advantaged with our blue water delivery to those projects require big volumes by water in a short amount of time. So if you put that over 2 million to 2.5 million tons this year I would tell you that next year for what we know right now we will -- and this is what we have probably under contract we'd be just south of 2 million tons. Is probably on the drawing board another 8 million tons in projects that are out there that haven't bid, they are still in the permitting or planning process. So no slowdown in the energy projects along the coast. PT Luther : Great. Thanks. In terms of the pricing momentum you're talking about in the second half, is that primarily from price hikes that you've already implemented and announced in the first half? Or does some of that assume some additional price hikes in the second half as well? Tom Hill : As we always say, our pricing is across dozens of markets, so each one is individual. Then you've got, within those markets, you have fixed plants where you have got price increases that come at all different times of the year. And then you've got quoted work which you are pressing price with each quote, each week. So, it is a combination of what we've secured, pricing that will quote higher in the second half and then announced price increases in the second half. And then you are also working off of old work, so you've got to put all that into the mix and again you've got to aggregate all those pricing movements across all those markets. PT Luther : Great, that's helpful. Thanks again. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research Garik Shmois : Hi, thank you and congratulations. First question is on diesel had a nice benefit here in the second quarter. Coming into the beginning of the year we thought there could be potential upside because of diesel savings. Just wondering how you're thinking about diesel costs in the back half of the year as it relates to your overall EBITDA guidance. Tom Hill : I think if you look at our guidance, this goes into individual operations, and so there is diesel savings built in from a ground-up perspective in the second half of the year. There's also built into that is labor costs and repair and maintenance costs and operating supply and parts. So I think when you put all that together if you look at our guidance we do have diesel built into it. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks. I guess it's fair to assume that some of the other costs you've mentioned will partially offset. John McPherson : I think that's the right way to think about it, Garik, I don't know that we're the world's best to predicting future diesel prices and those kinds of things, but we will begin to comp over, if you will, lower costs as we get into the third and fourth quarter. So I think you summed it up well which is, we would expect to continue to manage to improving margins in the second half in total, and underneath that is a mix of several factors probably a little help from diesel costs, probably a little bit higher repair and maintenance costs than we have seen in the past. Garik Shmois : Makes sense. Shifting to capital allocation, you mentioned think it was $30 million or so to update your Panamax fleet. Just wondering if this is in relation to any sort of capacity addition that you are undergoing in the Cancun facility and if we should anticipate increased volumes coming out for your long-haul operations? Tom Hill : These are specific replacements for the ships that we started that operation with. So those ships are some 30 years old. It's time for them to retire for all kinds of reasons. Now what we will get in the new ships is, with technology, we'll have a little more payload. We'll have much better fuel efficiency's and probably a little better speed out of the ships, so we'll get better efficiencies, but the bottom line of that is those ships are replacements. Garik Shmois : Okay. I'll ask the highway bill question. You sounded pretty optimistic in your prepared remarks around a new highway bill. Just wondering, it's early, but if you could provide some thoughts on if we do get a multi-year bill towards the end of the year potentially what kind of volume opportunity would that imply for aggregates demands moving forward? Tom Hill : I don't know that we put a number to that, because we've got so many unknowns in that highway bill and what does it mean. We have not at this point. The one thing I will say is that a long-term bill, even at the funding we have today, is a good thing for us. Because it gives security to those states so that -- we've got a number of states that are pushing back big jobs because they don't have security that they're going to get paid by the federal government. So worst-case if we get flat funding with a long-term bill we look at it as a very good thing. At the same time, we've got a number of states which have already substantially increased their funding, and we have a number of very key states to us including California which are looking at ways -- recognize that they have to increase their funding and are taking steps towards that. So overall, with the steps that the Senate is taking and that the house is taking we're pleased with it. We've got high hopes for it. We think we've got a lot of momentum. And on top of that you've got the momentum of improving state funding or the recognition that state funding has to increase. Garik Shmois : Got it. Thanks again. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Hi, good morning. Tom Hill : Good morning. Jerry Revich : Just to continue the discussion on the regulatory side. California is in session, or the legislature is in session about potentially increasing state highway funding. How optimistic are you that something goes through and what's your sense on where that process stands now? [Multiple Speakers] Tom Hill : Let me give you a little background on California. Their highway bill right now is at about $11 billion annually. If things stay status quo, they've cut that to about 5% to about $10.5 billion. They recognize that they have to take steps to not only keep that whole but to improve it. There's Senate Bill 16 which is out there right now which would increase it by another $3 billion. It is too early to give you a guess on that at this point or a prediction. I think the good thing is that they recognize that they have a shortfall. They're going to have to address it, and they are taking steps for it. Of there's any place that needs roads, California sure does. They do recognize it, and the leadership there is taking steps to improve it. Jerry Revich : What's your sense on timing? How do you expect it to play out what are the negative -- Tom Hill : Too early to tell. I think it's too early to tell. I wouldn't take a guess at it at this point. Jerry Revich : In the press release you highlighted stripping costs just naturally in mine plans evolve as companies get price increases. Can you just counsel us on how to think about stripping costs over the next couple of years? How much are you changing mine plans as pricing is picking up here? Tom Hill : I don't know that were changing mine plans with pricing. That wouldn't drive a mine plan. It's really based on the long-term operations of a quarry. Obviously as volume goes up you just have to strip more because you have your producing more tons. I think other times, as we are opportunistic when we strip, so it may be that when we are not running operations for whatever reason we take the crew and equipment and go strip because is it's just good sense and good use of costs. But overall, I don't see -- price doesn't have an impact, volume obviously does, because you just have to strip more with more volume. And in each individual mine, it's based on what that operation has to do for the long-term. We're running these operations for decades, not a few years, so -- and stripping is the big part of the long-term planning. Jerry Revich : Alright, thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital Markets. Adam Thalhimer : [Indiscernible] Thanks. Tom Hill : Good morning. Adam Thalhimer : John, I think you said for this year -- you did say for this year up 7% price you were previously saying up 6%. I thought I heard you say that that level of pricing growth is a good number for 2016 as well. Is that right? John McPherson : I think what we said -- I wouldn't put down a specific level, but we currently see this kind of pricing momentum continuing into 2016. It's not just -- this is a more structural trend in our business. It's not a one or two or three quarter trend. But not trying to give you guidance for any specific number for 2016. Tom Hill : Let me add a little bit to that. I think it's more about momentum. And you are seeing -- we told you that price was going to follow volume. And that as volume continued to grow, pricing would grow behind it. And that was very apparent in the second quarter. I think as we continue to see volume grow, you will continue to see pricing momentum grow. Not just the percentage, but overall pricing will continue to accelerate. Adam Thalhimer : You gave a good breakdown of volume by month in Q2. I'm just curious whether you can share figures for July. John McPherson : No, we're not -- we can't give guidance at this point on that. Adam Thalhimer : Worth a shot. And just in general it feels like volume -- it feels like you've been a little conservative with the volume expeditions in the back half. I guess you're assuming that 3 million tons are either lost because of the weather or maybe push to 2016? Tom Hill : I think for sure they are not lost. Those jobs are not going away. Our customers have a backlog and are going to do the work. It's really a matter of if you look at hundreds of jobs and even the fixed plant with hundreds of jobs, can they get on that job? Can they get it all done in the compressed amount of time they have to do it in the construction season 2015? So if they don't get it done, it will push back into first quarter, second quarter of 2016. If you look at asphalt for example, asphalt and our ready mix plant is do they have the plant capacity and the truck capacity to catch up from where they are? Again, it's not lost. If it doesn't happen in 2015, it will happen in 2016. As I said earlier, this is really normal for when we have severe weather like this. We'll do the work. It's just a matter of timing. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. Thanks, Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll now hand the call back over to Tom Hill, President and CEO, for your closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank all of you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We are proud of our second quarter, and we look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. We'll talk to you then. Thank you. Operator : This is the end of today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets Operator : Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Tabitha and I'll be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark D. Warren - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Tabitha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, President and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Please note a slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks by management and is available via the webcast. A copy of this presentation as well as a replay of the conference call will be available following the conclusion of this call at the company's website. Before we begin with actual results and projections, I refer you to slide two of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. At Vulcan, we posted another strong quarter, and we remain on track to have a very good year. Our solid performance, continued revenue growth and margin expansion are a direct result of the great efforts of our people. Today, you're going to hear about steady recovery, solid price improvement and about our sharp focus on the things we can control. Now, we won't be giving guidance for 2016 in today's call, but as we begin our planning cycle for the next year, our fundamental trajectory remains intact. We continue to experience a gradual, steady recovery in demand and shipments, although the details, of course, vary from market to market. We also continue to see a positive pricing climate with appropriate increases either announced or planned for next year. We remain well positioned to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at an impressive click. We're excited about the opportunities ahead. Our people know that they must remain highly focused on margin improvement and continue to drive ongoing improvements in our business. We're focused on capitalizing on our momentum. Our people are engaged and entrepreneurial and they are sharing best practices across the organization. They know that they are empowered to serve our customers and keep making our company more profitable and better in every way. We also, all of us, remain highly focused on safe operations protecting the health and safety of our employees at all times. Now to company specifics. The recovery in construction activity continued across most of our markets. As we will show you, the metrics are certainly trending in the right direction. While demand is recovering gradually to more normal levels, we've enjoyed sustained margin expansion and we continue to grow our profitability in a disciplined manner. As construction activity and materials demand continue to pick up, we're also seeing improving confidence in pricing. Now, we've had some cost increases during the last two quarters. Even though some of this is expected given volume growth, we are very focused on continually improving our operating performance. These efforts began to pay off in September, when we saw marked improvements in our costs. We are going to stay very focused on this. Our employees are doing a really good job turning incremental revenues into incremental profits. And let me add, we see these trends continuing. We are heading into 2016 with the wind at our back. That said, we are totally focused on finishing this year strong. Now, let's talk about the third quarter. Demand continued to recover gradually in the quarter. Our results demonstrated the earnings leverage in our business model. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continued to expand. As you can see on slide four, a 19% increase in total revenues converted to a 39% increase in gross profit. This also drove a 47% increase in adjusted EBIT, and a 31% increase in adjusted EBITDA. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 82%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.95 per diluted share and an increase of $0.41 from the prior year. Gross profit margins increased by 490 basis points and were supported by pricing momentum. We enjoyed strong earnings growth in Aggregates as well as in our Asphalt and Concrete segments. We continue to manage and leverage SAG. SAG costs did increase in absolute terms. Here, one-time items offset lower head count related costs. What's important is as a percent of sales, SAG is trending towards 8% for the year, down about 1% from the prior year. All in all, I am very pleased with our peoples' performance, whether measured by margin percentage or per unit profit, our profitability continue to improve very significantly. Now, let's take a look at our shipments across the U.S. The map on slide five shows a breakdown of our growth in shipments of Aggregates on a same-store basis across the country. In the quarter, we saw solid demand growth, even though many customers faced bottlenecks impeding shipments. It's important to recognize what a good job our local teams are doing working with our customers to meet rising demand effectively and efficiently. Momentum continued with solid growth in key states; shipments in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana each grew by 10% or more. In contrast to the majority of our markets which were up, Illinois was down about 10%. This was due to significant large project work completed in 2014. Now at the same time, California saw healthy growth in the third quarter as major projects kicked off after being delayed in the first half of the year. I'd like to turn your attention to slide six, which shows our year-over-year growth in shipments. As you can see, this is very similar pattern to the last slide, with solid year-to-date growth in Aggregates shipments of 10% in total or 7% on a same-store basis. Both our East and West Coast markets continued to enjoy healthy growth as did Texas. Shipments in the Gulf Coast markets were also strong, with the exception of the central Gulf Coast region. Turning to slide seven, you can see that our pricing continues to strengthen, and for the quarter, it improved in line with our expectations, up 8% over the prior year's quarter. In a number of markets, we saw year-over-year freight adjusted price improvements in excess of 10%. These increases were fairly broad-based and occurred across all product types. And in more than half of our markets, we had price increases, ranging from $0.60 to $1.20 per ton. For the quarter, we didn't see this level of price increases in Virginia, South Carolina and Arizona because we had much larger shipments of base material and fines on new construction and large projects. As discussed before, volume in base and fines can detract from price, but it improves overall profitability. Let me emphasize the fact that pricing momentum will continue for us. There are three primary reasons that the pricing climate should remain positive. One, customer confidence continues to improve. Two, increasing demand builds backlogs. And third, construction related businesses are increasingly focused on earning adequate returns. Effective pricing performance remains a key focus for our management teams across our footprint. We are focused on delivering value to customers, while earning a good return on the significant investments that we make on their behalf. This ties directly to providing excellent service to our customers \u2013 the right product, the right quality, the right time and being paid the right price for superior service and value. Now, we've talked a lot on past calls about the three profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits. That's because it's important. As a reminder, the three profit drivers are sales and production mix, price and operating efficiencies. We call these the three circles. As you can see on slide eight, our third quarter and trailing 12 month, gross profit per ton increased 23% and 25%, respectively. So in the quarter on a same-store basis, price was up $0.86 per ton and gross profit margin was up $0.90 per ton. Our sales and operations people are doing a superior job turning demand growth into higher profitability. Our local teams continued to do an outstanding job managing the combination of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product mix. This is something we will stay focused on every day. With respect to the three circles, we've talked about the positive pricing environment and we've talked about new construction improving the impact of product mix on profitability. Regarding the third circle, operating efficiencies and leverage. We continue to emphasize production planning and operating efficiencies across the business. Despite improvements in unit profitability and same-store costs, we have seen some areas of rising costs. As I mentioned, I'm not satisfied with this and neither are our people. Still, we've seen some costs rise; about two-thirds of these increases resulted from geographic mix and fringe benefits often outside our control. In addition, during the last two quarters, we have begun to see a trend of rising repair and maintenance and labor costs in some areas. Even though this isn't surprising, we are not going to accept it. Growing volumes are requiring us to run operations longer, resulting in more repairs and higher than budgeted spending on parts and supplies. And labor costs in some areas were up in the first eight months of the year. We saw costs go up, we focused on them, and we realized improvements in September. We will continue to manage these costs very carefully. Let's turn to slide nine. Our employees can be very proud of this chart. It clearly shows that our people are highly focused on continuous improvement and quality of earnings. We're excited about the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion. We have now seen nine consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin and we'll continue to post improvements. Since our volumes began to grow in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton has increased sharply. We are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations were producing twice the volume. Again, I would expect this trend to continue into 2016. Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in the Aggregates segment. This underpins the margin improvement you saw on the previous slide. Our incremental gross profit margin for the third quarter was 72%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $60 million on incremental freight adjusted revenues of $83 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65% with a gross margin on those revenues impacted mainly by higher costs at acquired operations as we bring them up to our standards and by higher costs for repair and maintenance. Now, since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or one-time costs, we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For this time period, incremental gross profit margin was 73%. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $177 million on incremental revenues of $242 million, adjusted for the same acquisitions. On a trailing 12-months basis, the flow through rate was consistently \u2013 has consistently exceeded the company's stated goal of 60% since volumes began to recover in the second half of 2013. Given our strategic focus on the Aggregates business, our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Thanks, Tom. I'll begin with slide 11, and as we did last quarter, use it to recap many of the trends Tom just reviewed. On this slide, we highlight the improved profitability of our Aggregates segment, both in total gross profit dollars and on a per ton basis, since the recovery in volumes began in the second half of 2013. On the left hand side of the chart, you see that for the trailing 12 months just ended, we shipped 175 million tons, 35 million tons more than for the trailing 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013, just before the recovery began. Now, looking to the right hand side of the chart, you see that Aggregates segment gross profit for the 12 months just ended was $682 million or $324 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. So, on 35 million of incremental Aggregates' tons shipped so far in the recovery, we've delivered $324 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.35 or 53%, and a 25% increase in shipments has been converted into a 90% increase in segment gross profit. These facts, we believe, illustrate the impact of the continuous, compounding performance improvements you heard Tom reference, and that in many ways characterize our current Aggregates centric strategy and execution focus. Now turning to slide 12, which shows the solid performance of our Asphalt and Concrete businesses for the third quarter. Segment gross profit and unit profitability in each of these segments increased significantly versus the prior year, and year-to-date the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plan. Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was $30 million, a year-over-year improvement of $15 million driven by improving same-store volumes, strong cost disciplines and margin management, as well as the impact of acquired operations. As a reminder, our acquisition and swap activities have added 19 Asphalt plants to our portfolio since the second half of last year. On a the same-store basis, Asphalt volumes grew 20%, in part due to work deferred from the first half of the year, and Asphalt gross profit grew $11 million. Vulcan is among the five largest producers of asphalt in the country and these operations complement our Aggregates operations very well. Third quarter Concrete gross profit was approximately $10 million compared to $5 million in the prior quarter \u2013 in the prior year. Margins in this business segment have benefited from divestitures and other actions to focus our portfolio. The operations we have divested lost $2 million at the gross profit line in the prior year quarter. On a same-store basis, Concrete volumes were flat versus the prior year and gross profit improved by $3 million. I'll now wrap up with slide 13 and a recap of our full year 2015 outlook, before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks. In short, our outlook for the full year remains largely consistent with that presented in our second quarter call, and we are reaffirming our expectations for full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $775 million to $825 million. As usual, we note that weather patterns can impact results in the fourth quarter significantly, particularly if they shorten the total construction season. But, and as you've seen earlier in this call, the business is performing well and it is performing as expected. Now, ticking through a few of the individual drivers. We currently expect full year volumes of approximately $177 million tons, up 9% year-on-year in total and 7% on a same-store basis. As noted earlier, we see the gradual recovery and demand continuing across most of our markets. However, capacity constraints at various points in the construction chain \u2013 for example, the availability of skilled construction labor in certain markets \u2013 have made it difficult for many of our customers to catch up fully on work deferred due to rain in the first half of the year. And the continued uncertainty regarding federal highway legislation has begun to impact timing of certain road projects on the margin. With respect to pricing, we expect the currently positive environment to persist. And we currently expect to finish 2015 with a year-on-year increase in average freight adjusted selling prices of approximately 7%. As we'd indicated, pricing momentum in the second half of the year has been stronger than in the first half of the year. Our Asphalt and Concrete segments have performed ahead of plan, both on a same-store basis and as a result of moves we've made to strengthen our portfolio. These segments should generate full-year gross profit of approximately $95 million. But again, please note that fourth quarter weather patterns can significantly impact actual results. SAG remains roughly in line with plan and declining as a percent of sales. Importantly, direct salary and wage costs for SAG head count have remained flat this year. And we do not expect the rise in the pension and other post-retirement benefit costs that we've had this year to reoccur next year. Core capital spending, excluding dollars committed to the purchase of new ships to service our Yucat\u00e1n quarry, remains in line with plan. As noted in our earnings release, we may elect to pull some spending forward from 2016 in order to capitalize on certain procurement opportunities. As has been our practice, we plan to issue guidance for our 2016 year during our February earnings call. And certainly a number of the things can change between now and then, including federal highway legislation which Tom will touch on in a moment. But as we sit here in early November, we see volume and pricing trends similar to those we've seen year-to-date continuing through the fourth quarter and into next year. And we, of course, remained intently focused on converting that top line revenue growth into cash flow and earnings growth, to the very best of our ability. As Tom, said at the beginning of the call our basic trajectory remains intact. Tom, back to you. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, John. Our employees are working hard to ensure our strong performance, continue revenue growth and margin expansion. I can't say enough good things about our people. They never quit, always try to do things better and have enormous pride in what they do; and I see this every day. Our priority is continuous improvement. We're going to stay very focused on the things that we can control \u2013 on keeping our people safe, on customer service, on controlling cost and on price. We'll get fair value for the major investments we make in this business. I can tell you, it's all about creating value for our customers and our company. Now, before I conclude, I'd like to say a few things about the highway bill. I reported in our last call about the significant progress in Washington towards a new bill. The Senate, with great leadership, did its job when it passed a new six-year bill, the DRIVE Act, on July 30. The House transportation and infrastructure committee marked up its version of the highway bill two weeks ago. Congressional leaders believe it may be possible to compress the two bills and pass the final highway bill before the end of November. We are encouraged by the bipartisan progress that is occurring in Congress to address America's infrastructure challenges. We have been very engaged in efforts to encourage Congress to step up to this challenge. A new multi-year highway bill will be a step in the right direction and our nation's leaders will need to take additional big steps in the years to come. This is important for our country, our industry and for Vulcan. In closing, I truly appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Looking forward to the rest of 2015 and into 2016, I want you to know that we are very energized and engaged. We are focused on the fundamentals, on finding new ways to grow our company and its profitability every day. Now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we will be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : Your first question will come from the line of Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you, gentlemen. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Ted. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, Tom, I hate to lead off on a question on 2016 given your opening comments. And so, I won't ask specifically for guidance, but just as it relates to maybe the slope of that trajectory heading into next year, it seems like depending on whether 4Q probably comes in a little bit below plan given some of the commentary; obviously one of your large peers gave some guidance that people are interpreting as off-trend growth. And so, I'm just wondering if you could give any kind of hand holding, whether it's market related expectations on how people should think about that slope. I know John just said basic trajectory intact, but any way you could kind of frame out, anything would be helpful, if we could start there? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me start with demand. We're seeing demand growth in all of our major markets \u2013 the vast majority of them \u2013 and in the market segments. More than half of our markets in the third quarter saw double-digit growth, a little bit of lagging as we talked about with Alabama, Mississippi, kind of the center of the country. But overall, we continue to see healthy demand growth, whether that's across geographies or market segments. So, we don't see anything that would give us pause for slowdown, whether in the fourth quarter or afterwards. Now, if you look at \u2013 on the same thing on price \u2013 we continue to see very healthy climate for price increases. That's built by customer confidence and by rising demand. Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay, that's super helpful. And then maybe if I can just quickly tuck one in on costs. I know you talked about being somewhat above expectations in the last couple of quarters. You mentioned some of the factors in the third quarter, including more recently, labor and R&M ticking up, taking some proactive action to address that. Just when we think about the normal framework of incrementals you've talked about, is there any tweaking we should think about in kind of the next one or two years that could affect that to any meaningful degree or is that still kind of a useful framework as we think about just normalized flow through rates? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Ted, I don't see anything that would change the fundamentals of our earnings leverage or our trajectory \u2013 just \u2013 it's not there. And I'll address the third quarter; our costs in the third quarter year-over-year on a same-store basis were down about a nickel. Built in that was diesel was down about $0.23. The increase occurred in fringes and geographic mix was about two-thirds of it, which geographic mix is usually remote distribution network or higher cost markets. That will always \u2013 fixes itself \u2013 so that will come back around. The fringes are one-time or won't last. The other piece of that was R&M, which is natural for this time of the cycle. And then in some areas, we had labor costs that some \u2013 that were up in the second quarter and the third quarter \u2013 we recognized those. I think our folks did a good job of addressing those and we saw marked improvement in cost overall in September. So it's \u2013 what's important here is that we focus on the things that we can control. It's imperative that we always try to improve that. And it's that compounding effort of every day in every quarry of making it better and compounding those earnings. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : So, Ted, I think if you just checked through each of those three big drivers of costs, none of them are really structural in our view. One is geographic mix, shipping from higher cost locations or markets, and frankly, that comes typically with higher priced and higher margin markets as well. So, that as Tom said, correct itself and that's not a bad thing. On fringes and those employee benefit related cost, most of that, including the pension accounting issues, we don't see repeating next year and we'll correct for. And then, I think, Tom gave you a clear explanation for how we've addressed to some degree already, some of the somewhat temporary headwinds we think we've seen in repair and maintenance cost and labor cost. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Kathryn. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions today. I think that you helped to answer some of the questions I had about the higher costs, which were more one-time in nature versus embedded cost on a go forward basis. Just to clean up that question that you had \u2013 the answer that you were just giving in the previous queue. How far along are you in terms of resolving some of those costs that \u2013 I know you said you made progress in September \u2013 but is this something realistically it will be more of a Q1 before you really kind of fully cleaned up? Or will there just be some residual, particularly from a geographic mix, that we see lingering in Q4? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me give you an example of labor. I think we got ahead of ourselves in a few markets on labor, where we thought volume's going to come back faster than it did. We hired too many people and actually we had to go correct it when we saw it wasn't going to happen. We also \u2013 we're running in a number of the places \u2013 we're running, say, four plants with two crews and we've made some structural scheduling mistakes there, which we corrected. So a lot of this, I think, we've taken really good steps to recognize the problems, why we have good metrics and our folks look at it really hard and they've corrected it. And then as far as the geographic mix that will come and go, I don't see anything structural to that. You'll get that back actually. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay, super. Thank you. And then, if you could \u2013 I know that the year ago quarter you made quite a few acquisitions. Could you once again just break out, how much the contribution from the quarter were \u2013 in terms of revenue and earnings contribution \u2013 were from the acquired assets versus just core growth? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, the adjusted EBITDA for the acquisitions in the quarter was in the range of $13 million. I think overall, our acquisitions' performing well. We're pleased with the assets and the personnel that we added at Vulcan. I think \u2013 I'm very happy with the job \u2013 the integration job that our folks did in getting those tucked in and going. We're pleased with how it fits into our network. So overall, we're very pleased with the acquisitions and like what we've got. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : And Kathryn, we can break out for you revenue or gross profit contribution by segment of the acquisitions offline, if you like. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : I think in total, we're probably trending toward \u2013 I think we'd said $40 million to $50 million of EBITDA at the beginning of the year \u2013 we're probably trending toward the low end of that range full-year. Still, very satisfied with performance, but as we've noted, we've had some increased investments to better manage some mine plans and improve production capacity of certain product types in some of the acquired facilities. And that explains some amount \u2013 that explains part of why we're at the lower of that range \u2013 but that's basically where we're tracking, around $40 million, but not towards $50 million. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Perfect. And then my final question is around Aggregate pricing. You've seen some accelerating in pricing as the year's progressed and really actually from prior year and carrying into Q3. Twofold question, are there certain markets we're seeing greater pricing leverage? And then two, we've just received anecdotal feedback from the field that, particularly in the Southeast, you have \u2013 I don't want to say changed your pricing structurally \u2013 but are certainly being more proactive in terms of gating pricing equally across all of your main product segments being base, fines and clean stone. Maybe if you could flesh that \u2013 either confirm or flesh out that feedback that we've been getting in the field. Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think that the pricing trends we see right now are very positive and very predictable, with the pricing following the volume. I think what the good news is what we are seeing going at the end of 2015 and going into 2016 is a very healthy pricing environment. We've got steady rising demand in the vast majority of our markets; that's driving customer and construction industry confidence, which is always a good thing for pricing. But, one of the things we always have to remember is pricing is a campaign; it's something you do every day. It's thousands of price decisions every week, and it's also about the compounding improvements over time of not just pricing, but margin expansion. So, our employees are striving hard to improve the value for our customers, and I think that if you step back and look at it, the environment that we're in right now and that we close into 2016 is very healthy for pricing improvements. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you. I just want to touch on demand and maybe if you could speak to any change in trends with respect to the demand segments, whether it's infrastructure, non-res or residential. I know you've commented that you're seeing steady progression on volumes, but has there been any, whether it's change in bidding or acceleration or deceleration, in any of these segments? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think that, as I said earlier, we're seeing good demand growth across all segments. Now, in the non-res piece, like you, we see the leading indicators. And we've seen them dip a little bit, but on the ground, whether it comes to shipments or bidding projects, we have not seen any dip in non-res demand. The good news is we're starting to see improvements in residential and in highway work. So, overall we're continuing to see good, steady growth \u2013 demand growth. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Garik, a few maybe pieces of the additional color since I know this \u2013 we know this is an area of focus for folks. From a geographic point of view, it's almost easier to talk about the ends of the spectrum. So, in terms of recovery toward normalized demand for us, on one end of the spectrum, certainly we have some Texas markets that are a bit further along in the recovery; in our view, still doing quite well, but a bit further along. And on the other end, as Tom has mentioned before, we have our Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, kind of our middle of the country markets, that really haven't gotten much momentum yet in terms of the recovery moving along; but everything else is making pretty good progress. The facts and circumstances vary by market, but everything else is making pretty good progress. The one issue that we do continue to see in some markets, and it will inform all of our plans for 2016 when we get there, is just the pace at which this growing demand and recovering demand really gets turned into Aggregates shipments. And again, in some markets that's \u2013 that's a function of large project timing and how quickly DoT's can get their raised level of funding out the door into new projects; so we'll monitor that closely. And in other markets, that's a function of these, if you will, bottlenecks in the construction supply chain that we've referenced, where availability of crews or equipment or developed land or skilled trade labor, those can really be the determinants of how quickly we grow. So, net-net, we continue to see across our portfolio, a steady, gradual repeating recovery that's basically on the same kind of trend we've been on for 2015. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Great. That's very helpful. Just wanted to dive in a little bit just on around the fourth quarter and your annual guidance and this fairly wide range that you've left for EBITDA for the fourth quarter. Just wanted to be clear on that range and what could drive the upper and lower end? Is it really just a function of weather and project timing or is there anything else that we should be paying attention to? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Hi, Garik, it's John. I wouldn't \u2013 we're not trying to signal anything by the breadth of that range. So, I wouldn't read too much into it first. I'd read it as unchanged from our last call. That would be the probably the main message because as I went through, most of the underlying drivers that we see are basically still on track with our last discussion on our last call. So, I think the read is largely unchanged. Yes, weather can affect it one way or the other, but I don't know that I'd try to read too much into the fact that we didn't change or narrow the range. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That makes sense. And then just lastly, just highway bill question. You sounded a bit more optimistic, and certainly the discussions around in Congress have been more optimistic, and I think there's greater hope that a highway bill will gets passed relatively soon. If so, could you maybe talk about how this might end up impacting Aggregates demand, whether it's 2016, 2017, and what the medium to longer-term impact would be from the highway bill? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think, first of all, we're very optimistic that the bill is going to get passed. We believe that the House will vote on the bill this week, as a matter of fact. When this happens, it will give certainty for states. So you'll see a number of states which are starting to \u2013 have held back funds for large projects \u2013 which is Arkansas has done that. We've seen \u2013 and now we see Georgia is talking about it \u2013 and a number of states have done it. Well, they'll have certainty for the future going forward, which will be very good for us. That is a compounding impact because a number of states have raised their funding. But you've got to remember, there's going to be a lag here between, whether it's the increase in state funding or the federal funding, just because they've got to be able to get the funds. And then, they've got be able to set up plans and let the projects, and the projects have to start construction. So at best, I would say it'd be the end of 2016, but I think the highway bill, the impact of that, you'll really see towards the end of 2016 and into 2017. What is hidden in there is, you will start to see states have great relief with unlocking large multi-year projects. Even if they said they're not doing it, we've got a number of them that are just hesitant to do anything until they see that bill. And that I think will flow through towards \u2013 start to flow through in 2016 \u2013 but real impact, I believe, will be in 2017. John? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : That's right. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question come from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Trey. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, just one point of clarity, I know you've talked about kind of the \u2013 some of the states there in the middle of the country that you guys are in that have been laggards \u2013 but just one, if, kind of going back to the slide deck, it looks like year-to-date, North Carolina was in the greater than 5% category. But then, if you look at just for the third quarter, it was in the flat to down category. Can you talk about kind of what's driving that? Have you seen deceleration there or just your thoughts around \u2013 that just kind of stood out to me? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I wouldn't read anything into that Trey. North Carolina last year, we had two very large paving jobs that we completed that weren't included in shipments of this year. So, I think that as you look at North Carolina, the demand's still healthy; it's across a broad range of whether it's res, non-res, highways or infrastructure. In fact, the North Carolina DoT just passed a bill to substantially up their funding in that state. So overall, we feel good about North Carolina. We feel good about demand growth, think, it will carry into 2016. And we'll start to see some flow through of the $700 million increase in state highway spending \u2013 now, that won't come through right away \u2013 but you'll start to see some of it, probably end of 2016, but healthy. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Trey, you might even take that as just an example, and I know you know this very well, but of why it's a bit dangerous to extrapolate too much in our business from single quarter trends. And that's, of course, in the volume side, why we include both the quarterly view and the trailing 12-month or year-to-date view. Whether it's a volume trend or whether it's a pricing or cost trend, we're always going to encourage people to make sure you also take a slightly longer-term view and don't focus only on one quarter just because there can be so much volatility. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah, understood. Thanks for the clarity there. And also, I guess as a follow-up, you guys had been fairly acquisitive, I guess, with some tuck-in deals that seemed to make a lot of sense. I guess recently \u2013 more recently \u2013 you've kind of taking your foot off, at least apparently, taking your foot off the gas a little bit there. Can you talk about, I guess, what you're seeing out there and how multiples are trending in the space? And then with that backdrop, kind of update us on your thoughts around capital deployment J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll start, John. I think, Trey, there's really a good pipeline of acquisitions out there. As we've talked about a lot, they will come when they come. That's something we can't control. Last year, they all seemed to bunch up in the third quarter. I think what's important for us \u2013 well, the timing of that's unknown \u2013 what's important is the discipline of what we buy, what we pay for and then how we integrate it. And we need to be real clear about the synergies that are unique to Vulcan and how we leverage those. So, don't read, because something that happened that the pipeline's dried up, because it hasn't and we are not \u2013 we have not put \u2013 taken our foot off the accelerator at all. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : And Trey, on overall capital allocation priorities, I think the key message is that our priorities have not changed and that we're making good progress on the direction we've laid out. Just to quickly tick through a few, as I mentioned, our core CapEx, reinvesting in the franchise, maintenance haz-mat capital, that remains on track and it is been executed well. In terms of financial flexibility and our overall balance sheet, making good progress, and again, going forward, that's not a use of cash to de-lever, and we've also reduced our average interest expense a bit; we'll continue to look at that of course. We remain committed to a dividend \u2013 and the return of capital to shareholders through that dividend \u2013 that grows with earnings. That's a board decision, but nothing has changed there. Tom just touched on opportunities for M&A-related growth where, we have many, it's just a question of discipline and to some degree, seller expectations that may be ahead of where they need to be. And then of course, as we continue to generate substantial free cash flow through time, substantial operating cash flow, we expect to have a balanced approach of reinvesting that, whether that's CapEx or M&A-like growth and returning it whether that's through dividend or share repurchase. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: That all sounds good. Thanks a lot and good luck. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Turning back to the highway bill, the various proposals out there have some level of inflation factored in their six year view. Can you just remind investors, would the impact of that be greater than the actual dollar because of the types of projects and the long-term nature of projects? Just getting for a feel of \u2013 we haven't had a six year bill in so long \u2013 sort of a refresher course of what to do with those numbers if this thing gets passed? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me start with the escalators in the \u2013 the Senate bill escalation is 3% annually \u2013 which would mean, you start at a baseline of $41 billion; in year three, it'd be $45 billion and in year six it'd almost be $49 billion. That compares to a House bill, the drafted House bill, which is at 1.9% annually, so a little less. Now, where we end up, our vote is for the Senate bill obviously or something beyond that, but who knows how that's going to turn out. While those increases are really important and we'll take all the funding we can get \u2013 more importantly, our country needs it \u2013 the confidence that this gives the states to move forward with long-term projects or very large projects is really important. It also \u2013 even if it's a six year bill that's only funded for three \u2013 it locks in policy for six years, which also builds confidence, not just for the states, but for the entire construction material cycle. So, you'll see this also builds on that confidence we talk a lot about for pricing momentum, because there will be funding out there, which means there'll be projects out there, which means there'll be work out there for our customers. And so, that overall confidence is really important, not just for our customer base and pricing, but also for the states that allow them to free up more work and drive demand. Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So, a 2% to 3% increase, whatever it ends up being in dollars allocated, could we assume when the dollar \u2013 when they hit \u2013 it would grow the infrastructure piece of your business greater than that? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : And keep in mind, that the parts of that funding that are non-federal, are growing typically in our markets at a higher rate. Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good point. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : So the state and local funding is growing at a substantially higher rate in many of our markets than you see the federal dollars, but as Tom explained, the long-term federal program is certainly helpful to getting those state level funds and revenues sources from being collected to actually being spent on key projects. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Along those lines, while we've had a number of states in our footprint increase their funding, we have a number of them right now that are critical, that are debating increasing their funding, okay. This will give confidence and it will give \u2013 it creates momentum for those states to go do their part where there is much needed funding from a state and local perspective. Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And at one point on \u2013 I think it was in the DRIVE Act \u2013 there was a talk of elimination of TIFIA. Is that still a topic that would be on \u2013 potentially on the table? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, that's really a reduction of TIFIA. TIFIA was budgeted at $1 billion a year. The DRIVE Act cuts it down to $300 million. And actually, truth be known, that's not bad news for us because we weren't getting to \u2013 we know $300 million is about as good as anybody got to, if they got that far \u2013 to using those funds. So more than half of those funds went unused. That will go into work on intermodal and infrastructure projects. So what our view of that is, it's actually pretty good news and that we'll get what we were using in TIFIA; the unused funding of that will go into major projects to address intermodal and infrastructure projects they'll actually ship materials on. Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask you, you've had a lot of success in driving gross profit per ton from $2.55 up to $3.90. And like how do we think about your ability to keep driving that \u2013 because I got to credit you, that's a ton of incremental improvement \u2013 but how much more runway is left? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Bob, it's John. Our view is pretty straight forward. We think there's substantial runway left. As you recall from our Investor Day, and we laid this out on a cash gross profit basis on Investor Day, but as we continue to move forward in the recovery, continue to move back toward normal levels of demand with the kind of pricing environment we expect, we should be able to continue converting that incremental revenue at about 60%. And doing that through this period of time gets us to a cash gross profit number that instead of being a little bit less than $6 this quarter will be a little bit above $8. So, substantial room left. I'd remind people that as an entire construction complex, more and more people are appropriately focused on earning fair returns on capital. And earning these kind of incremental margins is consistent with that view. So, we are very, very focused on it and we don't see anything from where we sit that should limit our progress on that dimension in the near-term. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Cool. That's encouraging. Tom, I haven't heard you this bulled up in a long time; it's a really solid quarter operationally. It looks like you're getting price for service. In your forecast, you're looking at 7% price for the full-year and you obviously gave a confident view of demand trends going into 2016. So, I'm trying to reconcile a little bit how we should be thinking about pricing trends next year. You have a tough comp if you're up 7% this year. Should we expect pricing next year to be low single-digit, more like consistent with this year? Thanks and good luck. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. It's all about the environment and I think it's in momentum. As you go into the fourth quarter of this year and into next year, as I said earlier, we continue to see that demand going up and very steady demand. It's about customer confidence. They have backlogs; they have backlogs with profitability in it, so they can raise their prices. So, it is that confidence in the pricing environment that is so key, and as we talk about a lot, it's very predictable trends that as that volume continues to trend up, pricing will follow it. So, as we said earlier, it's the campaign of pricing and those compounding improvements over time, but going into the fourth quarter and into 2016, what I'd tell you is that that pricing environment is very healthy. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Could you just get a little more specific in thinking about 2016 to guide us? Is it more like, hey, you're at great pricing, lot of demand, we're up 7% in 2015? Against that comp would you expect to be at the low single-digit into the range next year or in a level more consistent with like 5% to 7% or 6% to 7% like this year in 2016? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Hey, Bob, it's John. While I appreciate the effort, we're not going to give guidance for 2016 on this call. But I'd just reiterate what we've said, which is, as we sit here today in early November, the core trends that we see in terms of demand recovery and the pricing environment, we see continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2016. So we don't see a significant shift in overall trajectory, but we're not prepared at this time to give specific guidance. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Totally cool. Good luck. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee. Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC : Hi, thanks, guys. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Hey, Todd. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Todd. Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC : Let's take, hopefully, short shot at beating that almost nearly dead horse here one more time. Just real quick, and briefly I think, are you guys seeing deceleration in any aspect of your business anywhere, and if you are, where? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think we've got some watch points. I'm not seeing deceleration anywhere. The watch points, as I mentioned earlier, were, one was non-res just because of some of the leading indicators. As I said earlier, we're not seeing that on the ground, what we're bidding and what we're shipping; but we see that, we watch it, and I think our folks and Todd, I'd agree, (54:32) are very confident. The other place to watch is, as we talked about earlier, is to watch Texas, with the reduction in exploration drilling and the impact on jobs. While we've not seen any impact yet, it's been an odd year in Texas where it was the rain in the first half of the year back-loaded the year. So, if there is a drop off, it would be masked and it's a place we'll watch. But other than that, I think we're pretty confident. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : This isn't a direct answer to your question, but I would just remind folks on this \u2013 as Tom was saying \u2013 on both price and volume, there is of course, as there always is, a lot of variability across our portfolio geographically. So, if you were to look at the rates of volume growth or the rates of price growth, they're pretty well dispersed around the average. And so, we have \u2013 of course, as we get a little more clarity on our 2016 plans \u2013 we're going to have some geographies that are certainly slower growth than others, and some that are faster growth than others, and we'll have to incorporate all of that into our guidance for next year. Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC : Perfect. Thanks for that. And then, same question. You guys talked about bottlenecks in some places. This is something that we've heard from builders and contractors and guys who use contractors. Can you talk about how much of an impact that's having and if there's any rhyme or reason? Is it certain geographies? Is it certain trades that you're seeing it in? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know that I can put a pattern to it, but we have seen a number of our customers run into bottlenecks which impacted third quarter shipments and will impact fourth quarter shipments. Now, that volume's not going away; it will be shipped. So whether that's in ready-mix business, it's trucks and drivers, it's finishers. In the Asphalt business, it's crews and lay down machines. And they're not going to ramp up \u2013 they'll ramp up a little bit, but not going to add \u2013 just have it slow down. I think what is key to what we saw in the third quarter and you're seeing happen at the end of this year versus last year is the sense of urgency by our customers. When I say that, last year if they got delayed, they just put it off to the next week or till the weather got right. Whereas this year, we're seeing contractors work on Saturdays and Sundays; we're seeing a lot more sense of urgency of getting these jobs done, which is very good news for us because that means they have backlogs now that they got to get this work done, so they can get on to the other work, which really signals from a macro perspective that there's more work out there and we continue to see the steady growth. Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC : Got it. Thanks for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys, good morning and congratulations. Quick question on the pricing or did you guys highlight kind of what the regional mix was versus the absolute pricing? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think that, as we said earlier, usually the places where we are further along in the cycle, we see better pricing. So, we saw better pricing in Texas in a number of places where the cycle's further along. And as we go into next year, I think that pattern or that trend tends to hold true, that the places where the cycle is a little more mature, you have a little more confidence in momentum and pricing. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Stan, it's John. One thing I just continue to underscore for those on the call is just as with volume, and I'll highlight both, but if you look at pricing by our general manager areas, if the average for the company was around 8% for the quarter, we have \u2013 and I'm just looking at what numbers I have in front of me \u2013 we have some that are 14%, 12%, 12%, 11%, 9%, and we do have a couple that are 3%, 2%, negative 1%, negative 3%. So there's a lot of dispersion based on local market factors, and in a single quarter, mix of business and other things. The same is true on the volume side of the business. If the average volume is roughly 7.5%, then you've got some that are up 20%, 19%, 13%, 11%, 10%, 10%. But you also have a couple, as we highlighted, that are nearly \u2013 like Illinois \u2013 nearly down 10%. And so, again, any single quarter view is going to have that kind of dispersion amongst our geographic businesses, and therefore all the more reason to make sure you also take these kind of trailing 12 month or longer-term views of the business. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I appreciate that. What I was trying to get at is that some of the markets that have say mid-teen sort of absolute pricing compared to kind of some of the low double-digit pricing, just how that's influencing the overall? And my guess is that as some of those higher ASP markets continue to improve, the whole pricing complex will improve as well? The comment about the bottlenecks and allowing some of the volumes to slip over into kind of, for the quarter or even into 2016, was that a material amount or is there any way to put a number around that? J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's really hard to put a number around. You know it's happening; you could see it happening. When you talk to your customers in the different markets, it's pretty widespread, but to put a number on that's pretty tough. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds fair. Thanks guys, and best of luck. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets. Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets : Hey, good morning guys. The environmental charge in the quarter, is that something we could see going forward or is that really one-time issue? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : I think it's primarily \u2013 this is John \u2013 primarily a one-time issue. And you saw some, if you will, elevated above recent trend cost and relating to other income and expense. And a lot of that had to do with some one-time environmental charges including some settlement of past liabilities. So, I would think most of that is one-time. Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then, you mentioned that there was some places where you have ramped up labor in anticipation of demand that wasn't quite as strong as you had hoped. Where was that? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Southeast. Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And let me add to that. It wasn't that demand that was off or demand was poor, it just wasn't as good as they had hoped it would be. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : And Tom, we've talked it about a lot, I mean they're going to be \u2013 as we continue to transition our crews and our scheduling levels, like many in the industry, from operating most of our plants as shared crews to having fully staffed plants again, there's going to be a little \u2013 the transition is not going to go perfectly. The key for us is to monitor it, manage it, correct it and to stay on top of it. But they're going to be some things like this as we transition from such historically low shipment levels back to something that's more normal, particularly given that we've been operating in some of these markets with shared crews across two or three plants. Just changing that staffing model is going to \u2013 is not going to be frictionless. Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets : Great. Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : That concludes the Q&A portion of the call today. I will now turn the call back over to Tom Hill for the closing remarks. J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan. As you can tell, we will finish 2015 strong and we're very excited about what lies ahead of us for 2016. We look forward talking to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Davidson Mike Betts - Jefferies Operator : Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Bridgette and I will be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. And now I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren you may begin. Mark Warren : Thank you, Bridgette. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information. Rather than walkthrough each slide as we've done in past calls, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2016. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state, and local funding for infrastructure and the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry. These and other risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom? Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope you have had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. As Mark mentioned, John and I will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2016. Then, we will be happy to take your questions. We remain highly focused on the fundamentals of our business at Vulcan, on the clear opportunities in front of us. Regardless of recent concerns that have swept through global securities markets, we are focused on the things that we control and on our improving profitability. We have made a lot of progress over the last year and we have a good report for you today. Aggregates volumes are up nicely, pricing is positive, our gross profit per ton numbers continue to be really impressive. We are controlling our cost. But first, I would like to start the conversation by making three basic points. Number one, we finished the year strong. Our teams companywide are executing our aggregate focus strategy extremely well. Second, I assure you that we will sustain this focus into 2016. We believe these efforts will result in more than $1 billion in adjusted EBIDTA this year. Circumstances obviously vary across our geographical footprint, but the gradual recovery and demand continues in each of our end-use segments. Third, our performance throughout 2015 as we continue to move through the early stages of construction recovery, demonstrated clear and steady progress towards the longer-range goals and the expectations we put forth at our investor day last year. With very few exceptions, construction activity in the markets we serve still remains well below long-term trends. However, we are positioned for multiple years of double-digit revenue growth with strong conversion of those incremental sales to gross profit. Now, I would like to go a little deeper into our fourth quarter and full year results. John will then hit the highlights of our 2016 outlook and I will conclude with some observations of our path forward. Let me say up front, I am pleased with how we finished 2015. Our mindset at Vulcan is that we can always improve and we work hard on getting better all the time in every aspect of the business. Shipments were strong in the fourth quarter whenever and wherever the weather cooperated. As we noted in our third quarter call, many of our customers have seen their backlogs grow as demand continues to pick up and as they face capacity constraints. We saw higher level of shipments on weekends and many of our customers were beginning to keep their crews on as long as the weather allowed. Those trends held up through the fourth quarter. Firming demand and reasonably dry weather in California and Florida contributed to year-over-year shipment growth exceeding 15% in those states. Shipments in Georgia grew by 22% despite wet weather. On the other hand, shipments increased in the low-single digits in Texas. This was due to extremely wet weather in October and November. The underlying shipment trends in each of these states continue to be good. In total, same store shipments for the quarter were up more than 8% in our aggregate segment, 4% percent in our asphalt segment, and 2% in our concrete segment. For the year, we shipped 178 million tons of aggregates. This is slightly above our midyear forecast of 177 million tons. And an increase of about 10% over 2014's shipments. All in all, this was a very solid year of volume growth. Remember this is from an asset base that has delivered aggregate shipments of approximately 300 million tons. As we talked about before, we are still early in the recovery towards 255 million tons, which we believe represents a more normal mid-cycle level of shipments. We have a broad base of demand both in terms of geography and end-use markets. We see each of our end-use markets continuing to grow. Some of our Texas markets are at the upper end of the spectrum of normalized demand, having enjoyed extremely strong growth. Most of our markets, however, are still well below normal demand and it should enjoy steady growth for years to come. We are seeing good growth on both coast with still a lot of upside. Other individual markets in the Central United States, such as Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga are also continuing to strengthen. When you put it all together, the longer term shipment trends we focus on continue to look good across most of our markets. Regarding pricing, we continue to experience a positive pricing environment in most of our markets. This is a result of three factors. First, we've invested substantial capital in the business to serve our customers and need to earn a fair return. Second, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in the recovery. And third, the construction industry is increasingly focused on improving returns on capital as volumes remain well below normal levels. Overall, freight-adjusted average sales price for aggregates increased 11% on a same-store basis or $1.18 per ton compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. In the quarter, we estimate $0.15 per ton held from product and geographic mix. For the full year, average selling prices increased 7%. Now, I would like to make a few remarks regarding our customer service and cost control levers. Throughout the quarter our teams did an excellent job meeting our customers\u2019 needs, including tight deadlines and complex demands on big projects both safely and efficiently. During the quarter, we saw improvement in repair and maintenance costs and overtime labor costs. This improvement contributes to our strong finish for the year. Costs during the first three quarters of 2015 have begun to rise as increasing volumes required us to run our plants longer. This led to more repairs and higher spending on parts and supplies and associated labor. Now, I said in our last call, we are very focused on improving these costs and we are beginning to see these improvements in September. The improvements continue and I am proud of our operating people for the work they have done here. We remain intensely focused on managing these costs efficiently balancing the factors affecting production quality, service, and cost. Still a clear picture comes with a longer term view, for the year, our unit cost of sales in Aggregates declined slightly as our employees remained focus on continuous improvement. We got better at controlling costs as the year progressed. We also saw reduced expenditures as diesel cost declined. Setting aside external forces, our strong emphasis on cost control near-term and longer-term will not change. Overall I am pleased with the progress we have made with our execution and our focus. We continue to focus on customer service, employee development, cost control, and our safety performance. We saw marked improvement in our safety performance in the fourth quarter. Let me emphasize, this is a continuous improvement track, a process of working to get better every day. We have made good progress but there is still more to be done. A strong example of the progress we have made is the outstanding job our teams did converting incremental revenue into incremental gross profit. Flow-through in the quarter was 89% on a same-store basis, obviously strong result. But better look at it on a trailing 12-month basis where it was 77%, well ahead of the 60% threshold we target longer-term. Our unit profitability in Aggregates continues to improve. Something our employees work hard on and can be very proud of. Gross profit margin on a same-store basis increased 38% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. Unit gross profit margin was $5.38 per ton. This marks 12 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. We will continue this trend on a trailing 12-month basis unit margin increased by 29% to $4.38 per ton. Now there is a slide you have seen before, slide number 11. That covers this. And I would like to call your attention to it because it's impressive. Here you will see that for the trailing 12-months, we shipped 178 million tons, 38 million tons more than the year prior to the start of the recovery. Aggregates segment gross profit for the year was $756 million or $398 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. So on 38 million tons of improvement, we have delivered almost $400 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.69 or 66% during this period. A 27% increase in shipments has been converted into an increase in gross profit in excess of 100%.  Looking at 2015 as a whole, you can clearly see the benefits of our aggregate focused strategy. We have the assets and capabilities in place to service our customers. We have the focused execution to drive profitability and we have a very strong platform for continuing growth. With that, I will turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John? John McPherson : Thanks, Tom and good morning to everyone. So, Tom just highlighted and as you've seen in our release we had a strong finish to a strong year. A year with same-store Aggregates shipments up 7%, Aggregates pricing up 7%, strong conversion of that incremental revenue into incremental gross profit, improved material margins in our asphalt and concrete businesses, and continued leveraging of SAG to revenues. We expect to see much of the same in 2016, another year of continuous compounding improvement in our execution and in our results. To complement the information shared in our release, I will first offer a few comments regarding the demand environment, then outline our performance expectations for the year and briefly note our plans for capital allocation. As Tom said, we see a broadening recovery and demand across each of our end use segments and across most of our geographic footprint. In total, we see demand across the markets we serve growing approximately 7% with some upside potential based on the rate at which rising DOT budgets and public infrastructure funding converts into active construction projects and material shipment. We project private demand in the markets we serve to grow approximately 10% year-over-year, supported by growth in both residential and non-residential activity. We see continued double-digit growth in residential construction across our footprint with non-residential construction continuing to expand albeit at a slower pace than 2015. Although certain measures of private non-residential construction suggested some decline in the second half of the year, our on the ground view indicates continued solid growth. And importantly, employment data and other macroeconomic and demographic factors further signal a sustained recovery in private demand across our markets. Much has been made about the potential impact of lower oil prices and we continue to monitor trends in private construction activity in markets such as Houston. But to date we have not seen a materially negative impact when looking at our portfolio as a whole. I will now turn to public demand where we see 2016 being something of a transition year and in a positive way. Across our markets, we expect demand growth tied to public construction of approximately 5%. Longer-term visibility with respect to public demand has improved markedly with the passage of the federal Highway bill, state-level funding initiatives and record levels of local tax receipts. In addition, the public construction share of tax receipts remains at 20-year lows and at ultimately unsustainable levels. This shift to higher levels of total public funding combined with greater visibility should allow for a higher percentage of new construction in the mix, which bodes well for our materials demand and in our case product balance. All of this is good. But at this point, we don't see the full benefit of these trends impacting our volumes until 2017 and beyond. We will monitor the lag between DOT budgets rising and a commensurate increase in product activity throughout the year. But to be clear, rising public construction activity is beginning to kick in with the question being at what pace? Finally, we continue to see the overall rate of recovery in many markets constrained by construction labor shortages and other bottlenecks in the total construction supply chain. Although the situation can inhibit the overall rate of shipment growth in the near-term and lengthen the time required to return to normalized levels, it does provide further support for disciplined increases in pricing, margins and ultimately returns on capital. So against this backdrop of approximately 7% total demand growth in 2016, what do we expect to deliver in terms of financial results? As we've stated, our 2016 guidance is for between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in adjusted EBIDTA and approximately 25% increase over 2015. We don't give quarterly guidance as you know and we encourage investors to consider longer-term trends in addition to quarter-to-quarter results. I will now comment on certain of the factors and assumptions underpinning our annual guidance. You should consider these figures to be mid-points of current Management expectations and keep in mind that our results vary widely across the individual markets we serve. Starting with aggregate shipments, we're projecting a total of 191 million tons or an increase of 7% over the prior year. On the geographic basis, we expect the growth in 2016 to be relatively widespread with higher rates in markets such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Southern California offsetting lower than average rates in markets such as Texas where we see continued growth but at a slower rate than the Company as a whole and Illinois where we project a small decline in year-over-year shipments. And as with 2015, we may see a greater share of shipments occur in the second half of the year in part due to the impact of El Ni\u00f1o weather on our Western States and in part due to the expected flow of large project activity throughout the year. Again as Tom noted, the overall pricing climate for our materials remains positive and constructive. We're entering the year with good momentum and we currently expect freight adjusted average selling prices for aggregates to increase 7% in 2016 in line with the increase seen in 2015. Please keep in mind that pricing decisions in our business are made locally with wide variances by product type angiography. Our local teams will continue to balance pricing, customer service, operating efficiencies, and the overall sales and production mix all with an eye toward improving total unit margins and earning a fair return on capital employed. These shipment and pricing expectations of course suggest mid-double digit growth in freight adjusted revenues for the aggregate segment. We expect to continue converting these incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at a 60% or higher rate. Consistent with this view, we expect gross profit in the segment to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year. And we expect to realize continued improvements in our per ton margins. We also expect to see continued profit improvement in our asphalt and concrete segments following on the strong gains posted in 2015. We currently project gross profit for these segments combined to increase approximately 20% in 2016. These operations are well positioned to benefit from the continued recovery and demand due to improvements to our asset portfolio, as well as our internal operating proficiencies. Our current forecast for SAG is 295 million, approximately 3% growth over 2016. We plan to continue to leverage SAG to sales even as we make important investments in our sales and customer service capabilities. Administrative headcount should remain essentially flat year-over-year. So to recap, we expect to see in 2016 much the same of what you've seen in a very positive 2015. As well as through the entire early stage of recovery so far. Our people at all levels of the organization are focused on helping our customers grow, controlling what they can control and driving continuously improve results for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now, I will conclude with some brief remarks regarding capital allocation. Our aggregate centric strategy and the way we manage it day by day is geared toward generating significant amounts of pre-cash flow even in periods of depressed demand. That's by design as you\u2019d expect and we give it a great deal of focus. Our priorities for allocating that cash flow and managing the inherent cyclicality of our business has not changed from those we've outlined at different times over the core course of the last year or so. In short, we intend to balance three objectives; reinvesting in the business for productivity and growth, maintaining adequate financial strength and flexibility, and a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. With respect to reinvestment, I will note that we plan to allocate approximately $275 million of cash this year to what we call core CapEx. That is reinvestment to sustain and improve the performance and productivity of our current operations. In addition, we expect to invest a meaningful amount in growth whether in the form of acquisitions, or the internal development of new production and distribution capacity. With respect to financial strength, and flexibility I will note that our debt-to-EBITDAR ratio is lower than 2.4 times. Refinancing activities during 2015 extended our decorations, while lowering our rated average interest rate. We do not expect to use cash in the near-term to lower our total debt of approximately $2 billion. Rather we have the financing capacity and the liquidity needed to fund smart reinvestments in growth such as those I just mentioned. And we intend to maintain that flexibility throughout the cycle. Finally, we expect the amount of capital returned to shareholders to increase as the recovery moves forward. As noted previously, we expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings during the recovery phase of the cycle. We also expect to use opportunistic share repurchase to return additional capital over time. With that I will hand the call back to Tom. Tom Hill : Think you John. You've heard me talk about the strong year we had and the things we consistently focus on to deliver superior results. Ours is a long term business. We set long-range goals and work hard to get where we think we can be given our world class assets and people. We are pleased with our 2015 results and the way we are positioned for future success. We've made clear progress towards the goals that we set forth in our Investor Day last February and are very much on track. We\u2019re on track to achieve $2 billion in EBIDTA at normal levels of demand. We\u2019re on track moving steadily towards a normalized demand level of 255 million tons per year of Vulcan aggregates. We\u2019re on track for continuing gradual recovery in each major end market and in most of our geographies. We now have a fully funded long-term Highway bill and we are very pleased to see healthy increases in state and local funding for highways and other public construction. We continue to anticipate aggregate segment cash gross profit at normal demand in the range of $8.25 per ton. This will be the result of solid sales execution, continued growth weighted towards our more profitable geographies, pricing fundamentals that continue to strengthen, and consistently strong incremental margins. At normal demand levels we also see greater profitability in our non-aggregate segment in the range of $175 million. Here we benefit from continuing operating discipline and improvements. The strength in portfolio that came with our asset swap in 2015 and improving materials margins. We also remain on track with SAG costs moving towards 6% as a percent of sales. SAG as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points in 2015. We intend to further leverage SAG to sales growth. As we look forward we believe that we are well positioned for several years of double-digit topline growth, with strong conversion to the bottom line. No matter how you look at this, I am pleased to tell you that we are executing well and that is the watchword of our people. Execute, execute, execute. Control your own destiny and finish strong. I\u2019m very proud of our people and the good work they are doing. I can promise you that we are all committed to making a good Company better every day. We are excited about where we are today and we are even more excited about where this Company is going. Now if the operator will give the required instructions we will be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners : Good morning, guys. Tom Hill : Good morning, Timna. Timna Tanners : Thanks for all that great detail. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around what would comprise the range of your guidance. So, if you could speak a little bit about volumes and how much that might include deferred tons from last year's weather and talk a little bit more about color regarding Texas that would be great? John McPherson : I don't think - when it comes to deferred tons in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit. But as you heard us talk about our customers and the sense of urgency, when the sun came out, when they are ready to work, whether it was weekends or evenings, they pushed a lot of work through. So, if there may be a little bit, but probably not a lot of deferred work from 2015 into 2016. Your second question was about Texas. I think that how we would look at Texas is obviously it's a very big state with multiple markets and multiple market dynamics. So, kind of breaking that down a little bit, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, West Texas all have very healthy demand growth that we think will flow into 2016. Houston and some of the coastal markets may have some softening in the private side, but overall I think that when you look at Texas it's still growing. Timna Tanners : Okay, great. And the only other one for me if I could is, if you could talk us, give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of M&A opportunities in general and how receptive are the mom-and-pop's right now or do you think, new job geographies or kind of where you have been expanding recently as your focus. John McPherson : I think, we continue to see opportunities for attractive acquisitions. The timing of that is always an unknown or question mark, just because when people decide they want to sell. I think the key piece of that is discipline - being disciplined in we buy, what we pay for and being very disciplined about how we integrate it into the Vulcan family. And we also have to be very disciplined and clear about the synergies that are unique to Vulcan and how we leverage them. Tom Hill : Timna and John, I just a couple I could add on your question, first just to be clear our outlook for 2016 does not include the impact of any new M&A. It includes the impact of transactions already done, but not any new M&A. And if you're looking for things that could be kind of swing factors and volume, one we have called out as again how quickly this higher level of public funding for construction converts into actual shipments for us. That can be a little bit difficult to predict and so I think that's a swing factor we look at during the year. And apart from a lot of the attention Texas gets I guess we would just also note that for us we see a very much broadening of demand across our markets. Our demand growth in 2016 is really driven not by just any single state story. It's really driven by the entire portfolio and we think that's healthy for us, we\u2019re excited about it. Timna Tanners : Okay, thank you so much. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Bob Wetenhall : Congratulations on a very nice finish two the year. I was hoping you guys could give a little bit of color, your incremental gross profit margin was off the chart, well ahead of what we are expecting, can you give us a little idea of how to think about that. Obviously you've got some terrific price, but you also called out mix. And then you mentioned there is aggressive cost control on repairs and maintenance and also a tailwind from oil. I just wanted to get a better framework for thinking about this and the likelihood of this persisting into 2016. John McPherson : Bob it's John, I will start. As we always do we would focus here on the 12-month number not just a single quarter number. We think it gives you a good read. So, I would encourage you to look at the 77 for the year as a more meaningful number than any individual quarter. And we just think that's a better way to look at the business given the timing of how varies revenues and costs can flow quarter-to-quarter. Now if you, you may have already done the math, but you will see that our outlook for 2016 implies a flow-through rate that's above the 60% threshold that we see as a long-term number, but it's below the 77 that we did in 2015. A couple things we think about as we look at next year, one is that we expect to have higher stripping cost as we prepare for future growth. And those are items that are expensed in the current year, but they really prepare us for growth over multiple years. That's a bit of a factor we are considering in our 2016 outlook. And we are also keeping an eye on what happens with diesel prices throughout the year. So, we continue to believe that 60% is a very good long-term number. We expect to see something north of that in 2016, but I would also tell you and I'm sure Tom will echo this, we\u2019re really confident and pleased with how our teams are executed because that\u2019s really where the rubber meets the road in our business. Our local teams are doing a fantastic job and we expect that execution strength to continue into the New Year. Bob Wetenhall : That's really helpful. I wanted to ask on slide 9, you had pointed out on the large improvement that you are getting in gross profit per ton. I wanted to see what you're kind of expecting working gross profit per ton climbed to the end of 2016 and what are your assumptions for the non-aggregates business in terms of volume growth. You laid out that 7% number for core aggregates. I just wanted to see your thinking on the non-aggregate businesses in terms of volume trends. Thanks and good luck. Tom Hill : I will handle the non-aggregates. I think that if we look at asphalt, we look at volumes probably up in the high single-digit, low double-digit range. Concrete same kind of range. And I think we have with both of those, both concrete and asphalt we have a very good, like aggregates we have a very healthy pricing and margin environment with rising customer confidence and demand growth. John McPherson : Bob, one more thing on the asphalt and concrete business before getting to aggregates profits. Keep in mind the asphalt business over time is really well expose if you will to increases in public funding, across many states. And so while the short term margin structure for asphalt can fluctuate, long-term returns on capital can be very stable and very attractive. Again tied to public funding, a little bit more on balance. To your point on aggregate margins per ton, first I will draw your attention to the longer term as kind of how we think about the business. As you heard Tom say, we think we\u2019re very much on track with the longer term outlook we put out at our Investor Day a year ago, which would imply on a cash basis per ton margins north of $8. And if you look and see what's happening in pricing, if you look and see what's happening in our operating leverage, if you look at our results so far through the recovery, we are at least on track with our long-term goal. I want to draw your attention to that because that's really how we think about it. In the shorter term for 2016, we continue to expect margins per ton to increase faster than the rate of pricing. So the year-over-year increase might be around 20% roughly maybe slightly below that. And again that ties back to a flow-through that is above the long-term 60% threshold, but a little bit below last year. So, we think it's a reasonable expectation, something we\u2019re confident our teams can deliver. Bob Wetenhall : And if I could just sneak one in, on asphalt pricing it looks like it's breaking away from the positive trends in aggregates and concrete, how should we think about that into the end of the year? Tom Hill : We experienced a very good year in asphalt in 2015. Our people will continue to do an excellent job of quality and service and provide value for our customers. Like stone, as I said earlier there is a really healthy pricing and margin story when it comes to customer confidence, backlogs, people have a vision particularly with the highway bill and asphalt. So, I think our folks are doing an excellent job of managing cost, material margins, while at the same time creating value for our customers. We would tell you and it's really hard to look at just price and asphalt, you really need to look at margin because of the fluctuations in materials cost, but we would plan to expand our unit margins in asphalt slightly of 2016 over 2015. Bob Wetenhall : Great quarter, good luck. Thank you. John McPherson : Thanks, Bob. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms : Good morning. John McPherson : Good morning, Trey. Trey Grooms : Great year. John McPherson : Thank you. Trey Grooms : My question I guess would be around pricing. Can you talk about geographically where you guys are seeing higher pricing relative to, or price increases I should say relative to some markets may be that aren't as strong from a price increase standpoint. I know you said that most of your markets realize solid price improvement, but any color you can give us geographically on that? John McPherson : I think, I would answer this way where we've seen the recovery more mature, those markets in general tend to be having a higher price increases and it's all about the environment, but across the footprint, we see good pricing environment with rising demand. The entire construction materials sector whether that's contracting asphalt, concrete, is seeing improvements in margin. I think people are really pressing that. And you've got customer confidence and good vision of what's going to happen. That vision is really helped by the federal Highway bill that passed. People know they've got five years offending. States know they've got five years of funding. So, I think as you see that that can only help the pricing environment. Our folks are working hard to improve the value that we bring to our customers. But overall, where we've seen the recovery a little more mature, we see better pricing environment. Trey Grooms : Alright that makes sense. Thanks for that. As a follow up, how should we be thinking about the favorable product and geographic mix that we saw on pricing. I think you pointed out it was about $0.15 positive impact. Is that kind of a one-time benefit, I know it's not one time, but I guess the question is should we be expecting a similar type benefit as we look into the coming quarters and into 2016 being a favorable geographic and product mix. John McPherson : Driving in the quarter some of that $0.15 was a one-time event and an example would be some very high-value product we shipped in South Carolina associated with some flood control. So, some of that we call out is a little bit one time. But what I would underscore is that even if you take that out our pricing for the year, the pricing trend we are on was actually still, a good bit above the 7% we had laid out for the year particularly on a same-store basis. So, I would think about the trend going into the next year, the momentum for next year on a percentage basis it's more like 7 plus as opposed to 11. Just because [indiscernible] period-to-period. Let me underscore one more thing, there is no deceleration happening on pricing. The environment is still positive construction and so what I would tell you is we have 7% in 2015, we expect 7% in 2016, we are entering the year we go momentum we have a lot of visibility to it and it is a pretty strong story. Trey Grooms : Just one more from me on the outlook for private is up 10% and I think you guys said res being up double-digit. I think that implies still some pretty healthy growth in your outlook for non-res. Specifically what do you guys see and that gives you guys confidence that the non-res market is going to continue to improve with that kind a clip and also if you could give us any idea of what your mix is in heavy commercial versus or heavy non-res versus light in your non-res exposure would be great? Tom Hill : I will start. I think we see and you said it steady growth in the non-residential sector included and embedded in our service is mid-single digit growth in non-residential. And while we've gotten some mixed singles, we've all got mixed signals about non-res construction with leading indicators, our outlook is very consistent with what we're hearing from our customers, with what we're seeing on the ground and what we experience day in and day out. So, I think we are quite confident in our non-residential forecast and it\u2019s steady. You said it best it\u2019s steady growth. Trey Grooms : Alright, thanks a lot guys, I really appreciate you taking my questions. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line Stephen Kim with Barclays. Stephen Kim : Yeah, I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit just about your, whether you saw a strengthening relative to your expectations really kind of at the end of the quarter, at the end of Q3 for example, you didn't really narrow your guidance range and it came in above the high-end and if you set step back and see how things trended over the course of the quarter, is it true that things really exceeded your expectations at the end of the quarter and where would you say the greatest source of upside surprise was? John McPherson : I will start. I think a lot of it had to do with great execution by our people, frankly. So, weather helped in a couple of markets. You saw that in the volumes, but overall weather was kind of a mixed bag in the quarter. Really, really wet and really, really warm. So, I think what we saw on the demand-side lot of what we would have expected, which is shipment patterns consistent with this continuing recovery and you heard Tom say when people are able to get work done, they did the work. But internally, the organization execution on pricing and margin management and cost controls in the quarter was excellent. And reflected strong performance throughout the year. We had challenged our people, Tom had challenged our people to finish strong and they did so. I don\u2019t think you see that reflected in our results. Tom Hill : I would echo what John said, our folks are really focused on executing and finishing and they did that. I think what you also see is, we talked about this a lot that sense of urgency out in the overall construction industry and they are focused on execution and they finish the year strong and with a sense of urgency because they got work behind it going into 2016. So, they need to finish despite inclement weather at times. Stephen Kim : Got it. That helps. Thanks very much for that. Now, I think you, from what I can gather from your comment on capital allocation it didn't sound like you were looking to - you were not including share repurchases in your guide, or in your outlook, I\u2019m just curious have you bought any shares back so far this year, that's basically the main question I had. John McPherson : Well, obviously we haven't bought any shares back this year because we are still in the blackout period until today. So, you'll see in our financial statement the reflection of shares we purchased for the end of last year before the blackout purchase ended, fairly modest amount. I might well repeat what we've said many times, which is in the context of our overall capital allocation priorities, which of course include reinvesting for growth, include financial flexibility and include returning capital to shareholders. Within that context, we would expect over time to have some, when we call it opportunistic share repurchase. Complements the dividend, which we also expect to growth earnings and we will report on that of course every quarter. Stephen Kim : So you don't have a 10b5 plan in place? John McPherson : No. Not yet. Stephen Kim : Okay John. Thanks very much guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Group. Kathryn Thompson : Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. John McPherson : Hi Kathryn. Kathryn Thompson : I have to apologize we had our power knocked out due to construction jobs in the Nashville area. John McPherson : We like construction in the Nashville area. Sorry about your power. Kathryn Thompson : It is what it is. It is more on the policy side, in your opinion when you look at that 22% growth in Georgia volumes how much of that was a assumption was normal weather versus seeing an early impact, the passage of [indiscernible] just from our numbers it adds an estimated $750 million fiscal 2016 and $820 million in fiscal 2017 in terms of incremental transportation revenues. Yes the reason we are getting in field is that yes there was certainly weather impact, but how much is with that volume also driven just by the passage of that bill? Tom Hill : I will start with the weather in that I think it was - it's a little confusing because it was extremely wet in Georgia. Yet it was extremely warm. So, we got help with the warm weather, but got really - the wet weather should have hurt us. I think it goes back to the thing we keep talking about is that we had a number of large projects that there was a sense of urgency of when they could work they went to work. In fact would that sometimes use more rock because you've got to get out of the mud. I think that there is overall in Georgia, there is really solid underlying demand growth in all market segments. In every one of them and it's really healthy. I do not think that the increased highway funding in Georgia has started yet. In fact usually that takes 18 months to 24 months to flow through. Georgia is trying to accelerate that in fact as John talked about earlier, you could see more of that in 2016 then would be normal possibly but they've got to get that out there. But to answer your question, it is the impact of really solid underlying demand growth in all market segments not the improvement in the highway funding. Tom Hill : Not yet because we share your view and longer-term enthusiasm with respect to the funding changes in Georgia. They were very long overdue. So we absolutely agree it\u2019s just not yet. I think what you're seeing now has been a long building improvement and a lot of private construction in Atlanta which Kathryn as you will know is one of the most depressed of all of the markets in which we operated in. We have a fantastic position and team in Georgia and so we're really excited about the outlook there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So in another words, a 75% to 80% increase in state funding [indiscernible] (50:16) haven\u2019t been really \u2013 there really is no impact yet for volumes? Tom Hill : I don't think you were seeing that yet in the fourth quarter, maybe a teeny bit and we\u2019ll keep an eye on how much we see in 2016. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you. Tom Hill : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Garik Shmois : Congratulations. A couple questions on pricing if I could. Your run rate exiting above the 7% average for 2015 and above the guidance for 2016. Just wondering why - just given the strength and pricing that we saw in the back half of the year, why wouldn't we automatically assume that the pricing guidance is conservative and John I think you alluded that it's a 7% plus view but what would take for pricing to trend maybe towards the low end of your internal expectations? John McPherson : I will start, Garik. If trying to trend towards the low-end, per se we feel like we have very pretty good visibility on pricing side. Pricing in our business Garik as you know is a function of literally thousands of decisions made throughout the course of the year. So it's a little bit inherently harder to predict. I think if we were going to trend towards the lower end, unless something unforeseen happens, to some degree it would be a function of geographic or product mix. Some shift in that but we just don't see right now. But I would echo as Tom said, the conditions for that kind of pricing increase would seem to be in place. And therefore it\u2019s included in our guidance. Garik Shmois : Okay. And then I guess you're not expecting much in the way of a big step up in DOT funding to benefit 2016 demand, it sounds like a 2017 benefit. But in the case there is some demand that comes through in the second half of 2016 from some new large infrastructure projects. Conceptually can help us understand how that might impact pricing if your business mix ends up skewing towards the start of new big Highway work? Tom Hill : Couple of things. First of all, I think we do have increased funding in - DOT funding in 2016 maybe not Georgia or a lot of the \u2013 some Georgia but you've got a number of states that have huge increases in DOT funding that we have built in the 2016. Texas is one, they're going from 6.1 billion to 9.8 billion. Florida goes up substantially. We've got six or seven states that have already passed increased funding that will flow through in 2016. The big impacts on the Highway bill and as funding increases, we need to take another step in 2017 coupled with the state DOTs will start letting larger jobs with the visibility of having long-term funding. So as far as pricing is concerned, I think as it does flow through, it will be a mix of work on the job obviously asphalt prices tend to be the high in the spectrum basis low but I think it could possibly help prices but I probably tell it would probably be pretty neutral. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks. John McPherson : Garik if history is in a guide, it should be positive for margins and overall returns. And again it's one more reason we keep getting people focused on the margin per ton line and not just the price line. Garik Shmois : Got it. Makes sense. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning guys, congrats on the great quarter. Tom Hill : Thank you. John McPherson : Thanks, Adam. Adam Thalhimer : You guys start off a discussion saying you\u2019re surprised of skeptical people are about the construction recovery. And then when you talk about double-digit revenue growth for multiple years, I mean that's something I would expect people to try to poke holes into. What would give you confidence in saying that about years beyond 2016? Tom Hill : I think Adam one of the things that's been a real game changer for this is the passage of a long-term Highway bill and the passage in multiple states for long-term substantially increased funding. That gives us \u2013 that really gives us the industry and us visibility and it gives you a foundation \u2013 a growing foundation in the public sector of demand growth. John McPherson : Adam, you need to look into it and understand of course that really with the exception of just a couple markets in Texas, all of our markets and our markets unbalanced are still well below normalized levels of demand. Construction activity has a long way to recover. It's not even driven by new economic growth. And at the levels we are talking about, we still have multiple years before we get back to 45 year trends of normal consumption. Mid to high single-digit shipment growth, a mid to high single-digit revenue growth if I can do the math correctly is more than double-digit revenue growth. And that's where this continuous steady rate of gradual recovery. Is it going to be a perfect straight line absolute linear quarter-to-quarter of course not? History hasn\u2019t worked that way, but history would also show that we absolutely recovered a normal and then in fact expand beyond that. So I think if you take a longer-term view, it's actually \u2013 it's not in fact it\u2019s anything conservative relative to history. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. Thanks for reiterating that and then just lastly I wanted to follow-up on Trey\u2019s question. I think he was trying to get a breakdown of the heavy in light non-res being the work that we typically follow housing and then maybe heavy \u2013 maybe you can give us a sense for what your exposure would be at a big energy projects along the Gulf Coast. Tom Hill : I tell you it's a good mix. With housing continue to grow, you will see the light follow that and it always does. We see really good housing growth in 2016. As far as the heavy, we still have substantial amount of projects along the Gulf Coast energy projects actually going into 2016, some in 2017 and some in the 2018. We've seen a few new ones start to look at engineering and permitting but that segment continues to be healthy whether it's refinery expansion, Port jobs, ethanol crackers, we still see substantial projects. We have - our outlook is very clear for 2016 and pretty clear going into 2017. Adam Thalhimer : Great. Thanks, Tom. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Ted Grace : Great quarter and great end of the year. Tom Hill : Thanks, Ted. Ted Grace : John, I was wondering if you could just step through either a gross profit per ton bridge or a consolidated EBIDTA bridge just so we can get order of magnitude kind of what the benefit in 4Q was, it's not hard to figure out pricing and volume but kind of R&M benefits, energy. We are estimating maybe $10 million a year on your benefit from diesel and aggregates alone. Could you may be just step through that so we\u2019ve got the data. Tom Hill : Ted, some of it we can do off-line in more detail, but let me give the highlights kind of quarter and year. And as always I try and draw more attention to the year. But in the quarter you saw that our total cost of sales per unit declined and that was a combination of you said continued diesel benefit year-over-year roughly in the range of what you discussed. But unlike previous quarters we did a better job of managing our per ton expenses as of R&M and some other costs. So on balance we had a decline in cost of sales for the quarter and I think you saw that. For the year, we had a slight decline in total cost of sales and that was really diesel benefits offsetting some raising per ton cost that we commented on throughout the year in terms of R&M, parts and supplies associated labor with that et cetera as well as some overtime labor as we ramped up production. We are really pleased with execution we had in the fourth quarter. We are not taking for granted that all of those issues are behind us. We are still ramping up production and we are still well below what she would normally think of as the sweet spot of production levels in many of our plants. So it's something we're very much keeping an eye on and manage tightly as we go through 2016. Ted Grace : Okay. And on a related basis if you kind of run rate current diesel prices, it would imply something like $30 million or so year-over-year benefit, just to mention what\u2019s baked into guidance or expectations. Tom Hill : I think our current guidance, our current plans would have diesel prices rising slightly relative to where they are now. It might be something that I need to check hour by hour, the way oil prices have been moving. But we don't have a further decline in prices baked into our plan. Ted Grace : Okay, great. The second thing I was hoping ask is just on SAG, a bit above our expectations in the fourth quarter. I know you highlighted kind of pension and profit sharing and some investment in sales. Can you walk through 4Q relative to expectations as we can appreciate that? John McPherson : Sure. And I'll do it relative to the year too. So I wouldn\u2019t take, don't read 4Q as a run rate change, there were some accrual timing issues that made 4Q higher. So I wouldn\u2019t read run rate for 4Q. For the year, we ought to see a bit above our expectations, which is not something we are pleased with. I think for the year we executed better than we forecasted to be honest. So my comments on SAG, which is probably a number I would like to be zero as a CFO, but our comments on SAG would be that administrative headcount year-over-year remained essentially flat. So the core wage element of our SAG was well in control. The variances were driven by fringes which is pension, payroll taxes, some deferred comp, calculations those kinds of things which we frankly just didn\u2019t forecast as well as I would liked to it at the beginning of the year. Some of those were driven a little bit higher with our rising stock price. We also had higher outside services fees and professional fees, those were legal and tax. And a couple other items associated with some changes we're making and some investments we're making on the sales side of our business. And then finally, our sales headcount was modestly higher in the year and our SAG is associated with that as we continue to invest in growth for the future. So again I think the execution was solid. We would like to see that number grow at more or like 3% than what we saw in the past year. We were to control it and we\u2019ll certainly continue to leverage it to sales. Ted Grace : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Great quarter again and best of luck this year. John McPherson : Thanks guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee. Tom Hill : Good morning, Todd. Todd Vencil : Good morning. A lot of steps been knocked out but just a couple of follow-ups. I want to beat the non-reservoirs a little bit more just given that that's where a lot of investor concern has been focused and everything you are saying would seem to completely contradict and/or a few lot of what I\u2019ve been hearing over the past few weeks from people on the other end of the phone. But you talked about some mixed signals from the forward-looking indicators and that doesn't jive with what you're seeing on the ground. Can you kind of help me think about how you put those two things together? What among the four indicators would look soft and have you seen any reflection of that, it doesn't balance out or you feel like the forward-looking indicators are suggesting softness or simply off-base are being interpreted wrong? Tom Hill : I think you've got \u2013 just look at indicators you've got [indiscernible] who actually showed some weakness in Q3 and Q4. And then you\u2019ve got the construction backlog indicator by the Association of Builder Contractors, so the U.S. was flat before our market in the South was up about 15% for Q4. And then more importantly what we're seeing in our individual markets you still got solid growth in the non-res. I'll give you little flavor on that. If we looked at how you saw - if you sit here where we are non-res going into \u201916, we see that Atlanta will be up high single digits; Nashville up high double digits; Nashville up mid double digit; Phoenix low double-digit; Chicago, low double-digit; Charlotte 10% to 11%. So you've got a lot of cities and a lot of locations where there is still very healthy growth in non-res and trying to take an indicator on a national level is tough to put into our world where it's just local and we've got a good visibility. Todd Vencil : Perfect. That helps a lot. And then on the public side, your comments about the fact that a lot of the highway stuff is going to kick until 2016. Georgia hasn't started kick in yet in terms of their states improvements and their transportation funding. Is there \u2013 would you think that highway growth in 2017 could be better than the growth rate in 2016 because of these factors? Tom Hill : Yes. And I would tell you \u2013 I think that will continue to grow 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 out to the future as \u2013 because the Federal funding is compounded at 3% per year. And then you've got a number of states who have already - are already now collecting funds. Those funds will continue to grow in the future and as important as anything, then that work will start flowing through. As I said earlier, you've got normally you have unless somebody is really accelerated plans on the shelf, you've got 18 months to 24 months of lag time from collecting the taxes to shipping rock. Now Georgia has announced publicly that they are going to be very aggressive about trying to turn work out in 2016 and I think they are working hard at that. We are pulling for them but it just takes time to do plans, get engineering, place bids and even get permits. So it will be and I said earlier this is a game changer for an industry and that you've now got a real visibility into the future for multiple years and you've got a foundation that is continuing to grow. Todd Vencil : Got it. Perfect. Thanks a lot. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Good morning. Good afternoon, everyone. Tom Hill : Good morning Jerry Revich : Tom, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about the price increase for January 1 that you\u2019ve put through for 2016, how does that compare versus the price increase that was rolled out to start last year? Tom Hill : I\u2019d tell you that it depends on the market. We really come back to this every time. We make literally thousands of pricing decisions every day. You've got some markets where we have January 1 price increases, you've got others that have a cadence of April 1, you've got others that have a cadence of April and October or January and July. So it's really all over the board and there's not just one price increase that goes out there. I would tell you that from where I sit, I'm very confident in our 7%. That will be over quarter-over-quarter, month-over-month, that will be choppy and always is. But at the end of the day, like we told you last year, we were solid in the 7% and that's where we finished. So I think going forward, I think, as you look at it that the environment for pricing and I talk about this a lot because it's so important, customer confidence and improving visibility out into the future and rising demand is very important. Jerry Revich : And as we think about the way the pricing cadence worked out over the course of 2015, like you said you built momentum over the course of the year, which was really the first time we saw that in this cycle. Are you thinking about the pricing cadence in 2016 lining up and similar fashion when rollup all of the \u2013 thousands of pricing decisions like you mentioned? John McPherson : It's hard to predict because first of all you are comping over very different numbers. And so at this point, I'm not sure sitting here in the first couple of weeks of February that's really hard to predict, it could line up like that or you could see it be much more solid or much more steady through the year. It's just too hard to predict with only a few weeks gone in the year. Jerry Revich : And then in terms of the Department of Transportation budget comments that you made. Can talk about year-over-year 5% growth, how much of that is based on their budgets versus what you're hearing from the folks in procurement and I guess what's the potential of that, we get projects started sooner relative to what's implied of 5% comment? John McPherson : Again that 5% is a rollup of a lot of different markets, a lot of different DoT and even more local engineering segments of DoT, or districts of DoT. And our folks usually have pretty good visibility to that just because they spent a lot of time knowing what those projects are going to look like. As I think John said earlier, you could see some big DoT projects get pushed forward. And we would welcome that, but at this point and they're talking like \u2013 for example, in Georgia and a number of other states, there is a lot of talk about that, but we haven't seen it come to fruition yet and we don't count that until we see that happen and I couldn't predict whether that will happen or not. Jerry Revich : Okay, thank you. John McPherson : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research. James Armstrong : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. First question I have is margins in the fourth quarter were really strong and then you mentioned fuel, but as fuel costs have come down have you seen distances that you can ship aggregates rise and if so what effect are you seeing from that trend? John McPherson : Theoretically that could happen, but I will also tell you that with rising demand, rising confidence, people are servicing the market and possibly serving the market closer to them as opposed, they don\u2019t have to reach out because the work is improving right around where they are. And this goes back to pricing environment and the health of it and people recognizing that we are not back to normal demand yet they've got to make returns on the investments they have and that\u2019s true for aggregates or asphalt or concrete or contracting. So \u2013 while I understand why you asked the question and it's a very good one, it's not playing out that way. Tom Hill : Most of our urban markets, which is a concentration for us, you've got a lot of other barriers to long haul shipping or truck \u2013 long trucking that go way beyond diesel costs, it\u2019s availability of drivers, availability of trucks, traffic patterns, regulatory issues around trucking, unpredictable service quality to further your are tucking the stuff. So there are a lot more things, particularly in urban environment to go into this and adjust diesel price right now. James Armstrong : Okay, that helps. And then switching gears to the Highway bill that you touched on a lot on today's call, you don't see much impact in 2016 yet, but what projects are out there and what type of visibility do you have for 2017 and beyond, can you help us quantify that a little bit? Tom Hill : I'm not sure I can give you individual projects. There are a number of very large projects that are in the works. There are bidding that are out there. I think what I'm not sure I could identify off the top of my head any specific large projects, but places like Tennessee, for example, have actually held a number of projects because they did not have visibility. Now what those are, I'm not sure I could \u2013 I could quote to you, but that's an example. I think what you will also see is it will be two things, it will be \u2013 part of it will be expansion and new projects, which we love because they are more intensive, but you've got a lot of states like South Carolina that really are and a number of other states that really have a lot of maintenance issues they will flow through very quickly. It may not be large projects, but with that funding there they will go head and these are overlays and things like that, which will come faster than the large projects. James Armstrong : That helps. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Hi, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. Quick question about the improvements you guys made on the call side of the question. You talked about repair and maintenance costs coming down. Is that because of new equipment that came in, some of the growth CapEx to help bring those numbers down. And then the second part to the question was around labor costs with lower overtime, does that mean that you sufficiently kind of staffed up some of these plants that had been needing or borderline needing a second shift or what have you to the point where now it should be smoother sailing heading into 2016? Tom Hill : I think you a little bit answered your own question and that obviously replacement capital and mobile equipment, fixed equipment helps to driven down [ph] cost. But it's really \u2013 what we really focus on while we do that and we do that appropriately, what we really focus on is doing proper preventative maintenance and timing and fixing things the right way the first time so you are not throwing good money after bad. When it comes to whether it's labor or uses of diesel or cost in general, I think it's that continuous focus on operating efficiencies. You heard us talk about we struggle with labor, we define \u2013 our folks defined it. And then actually in the back third of the year, it wasn't just last quarter, September forward they made significant improvements on their efficiency to labor and their planning. And again, so you're correct about shifts where you're bringing things up and you're running multiple crews between even more plans, labor can be a challenge without appropriate planning. I am very pleased with our operating people that they are never been satisfied, they are campaigning for continuous improvement and they focus and work hard every day and I give them credit. They are never satisfied and they work tirelessly on it. But all of this is about compounding that continuous improvement to give us the margin expansion that we've enjoyed over the last ten quarters. And that speaks to that never being satisfied and that continuous campaign to improve and improve those operating efficiencies. Stanley Elliott : One last one, the issues kind of going on with the credit market does that have any bearing on when you guys ultimately and finally get bumped up to investment grade? Tom Hill : You probably have to ask the rating agencies. It should not from my point of view, but that's obviously up to the agencies. Stanley Elliott : Yeah, fair enough. Thanks guys and congratulations and best of luck. Tom Hill : Thank you. John McPherson : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : Thanks. Great quarter, great year. John, could you elaborate on your comment about product balances in the public sector to work with. Are you referring to some of the downstream businesses or is that related to the types of aggregate you expect as the market gets more momentum? John McPherson : It's more of the types of aggregate. New construction can be more aggregate intensive, but It helps us if you will produce and so the full product mix whether that's asphalt size, that\u2019s concrete size base. And so It's very efficient work for us if we do it the right way. And it's just a better mix than we\u2019ve had, I\u2019m going to call it, earlier in the recovery. My main point from that that I would like to make for people as we tend to focus only on the price impact when it's conceivable that it could have a marginally negative price impact yet be very positive for unit margins. Brent Thielman : Got it. And I know a lot of questions on this Highway bill. I will ask one more. I'm curious to your thoughts states now have greater federal funding clarity, do you see or hear any conversations or anticipate that this bill could actually be a catalyst for more states now to kind of think about a gas or sales tax. I know we have seen a few of them already but given the sense that they have some idea of what's coming to them from the federal government and there are certain needs out there. Could that push more through some of the state? Tom Hill : Absolutely. And I think you said it best. It is being a catalyst for states that haven't increased their funding to take matters into their own hands. They recognize the opportunity they have with increased and long-term federal funding. So you will see a number of states, California, Santa Clara, for example, who are \u2013 the state legislature are in the throes of trying to address much-needed infrastructure improvements. Brent Thielman : Okay. And then of all of this with the bill in place in your served markets, where do you think this can have the biggest impact or where do you feel like the burdens been greatest because of lack of federal funding clarity? Tom Hill : I think we\u2019ve had a number of states that have \u2013 Tennessee to be an example, Arkansas is an example, South Carolina is an example, they've been very hesitant to increase their own funding but also to let much-needed major projects that are multi-year because either they have a legal obligation that they can't or they're worried about being paid back. So I think as you\u2019ve said in your opening question and comment, it will be a catalyst for both. Brent Thielman : Great. Thank you. Operator : And you next question comes from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies. Mike Betts : Yeah, thank you very much. I have two questions if I could please. First one on -- Tom Hill : Mike, I'm sorry, I can\u2019t hear you. Mike Betts : Can you hear me any better now? Tom Hill : That's great. Sorry about that. Mike Betts : No worries. I had two questions if I could. First one, returning to the non-res area, is it possible to give us some indication of when you kind of did the budget, roughly what proportion of the work assumed in non-res was already contracted and therefore there\u2019s some kind of certainty because I'm sure you follow all of the contract award states rather than you took a view it might happen just to give us some \u2013 maybe some \u2013 a bit more confidence in that non-res numbers? And then secondly on the asphalt because it expanded quite significantly in 2015. How much now is kind of maintenance work, which is let probably during the year that the work is done rather than long-term contracts? John McPherson : Clarity on the non-res, I'm not sure I can give you a percentage of what is backlog, that\u2019s really hard to do, because so many of those are small jobs that you have to get into the local detail whether it\u2019s a Walmart parking lot or a big box store or a high-rise. That's really hard to predict. Tom Hill : The heavy side of it is pretty clear. John McPherson : Yeah. And that\u2019s where I was going. The big work, the major projects we have very good clarity, in fact we are already shipping them or we know exactly when they are going to start because those jobs have very tight and very tough deadlines. Very specific delivery obligations and so we know exactly what's going on with those. Mike Betts : You were asked earlier, I am not sure that you wanted to answer to it, but the rough split heavy and light. John McPherson : I'm not sure I have a number for you. I have to get back with you on that. Mike Betts : Okay, okay. And then on the asphalt again a big, short-term work versus long-term work, rough proportions and what happens like if \u2013 if the actual price moves dramatically? Tom Hill : I think there is probably a pretty good mix of short-term and long-term work, the majority of it, I would usually when you look at that overlays are shorter term, new construction is longer-term, you're going to be more heavily weighted towards the shorter term for overlays as opposed to new construction. I would tell you that towards the end of this year and moving into 2017 and 2018, you'll see the market piece of that of the longer-term growth and we've seen that grow over the last 18 months. But the majority of it's going to be shorter term. John McPherson : And Mike while our material margins in asphalt can fluctuate period to period, I'm not sure this is quite what you're asking but we don't have lots and lots of long-term fixed-price contracts or anything like that. Mike Betts : Okay. John McPherson : So, obviously, the margin can fluctuate period to period as you know asphalt can be a bit more volatile in its margin than some other parts of the business. Although generally always positive and good. But, no, we don't have lots of long-term fixed-price contracts that give us some big exposure. Mike Betts : And just to finalize on that, have you \u2013 I mean, the liquid asphalt price I think was \u2013 the cost was declining way slower than the oil price, is that still the situation? Tom Hill : Liquid asphalt prices have probably somewhat leveled off. And I think that's how we \u2013 as we plan this, that would be our plan now. Who knows, [indiscernible], but as I said earlier with that, we do have a modest increase improvement in our unit margins in asphalt. And that's really driven by some operating efficiencies and some actually some new capital we put into that product line as well as we think we've got a little bit better from an operating perspective. Mike Betts : Understood. That's great. Thank you both very much. Operator : And we have no further questions. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill for any closing remarks. Tom Hill : I would tell you thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan Materials. I would like to thank our folks for their tireless efforts to improve our company. I would also like to reiterate we are very excited about our future, we look forward to talking to you in the weeks to come. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your line.",

Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Operator : Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Alicia, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Please go ahead, sir. Mark D. Warren - Director- Investor Relations : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available, during this webcast and on our website, supplemental information. Rather than walk through each slide, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our quarterly results and outlook. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure, the highly competitive nature of construction materials industry, and other risks and uncertainties. These are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. As you saw reflected in our financial results, our teams really hit on all cylinders during the first quarter, particularly in our core aggregate segment. We met our customers' needs for higher volumes of material. We continue to migrate prices upward with an eye towards longer-term returns on capital. We leveraged fixed cost and lowered our unit cost of goods sold even after excluding the impact of lower diesel cost. And obviously, our margins and total profits for the quarter grew rapidly as a result. On a 21% gain in total freight-adjusted revenues for the company, our teams delivered 112% gain in total gross profit. It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single quarter's results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals. Several things about this quarter really stand out in my mind, and I'd like to spend a little time discussing them with you. As a starting point, I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our markets still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long, gradual recovery in demand. It's not unusual in such recovery to experience periods of relatively faster and slower growth. And certainly, our first quarter saw a number of positive things come together all at once, but we are still in early stages of recovery for the construction economy. For example, to underscore a point, we entered 2016 in terms of per capita Aggregate demand relative to long-term averages, pretty close to where we were at the time of the 1982 recession. Having said that, clearly, the fundamentals of our business and our core aggregate focus strategy are very strong. This is, to our way of thinking, a recovery with real staying power. Of course, we will take 17% shipment growth whenever we can get it, but what impresses me about the quarter, and really the last 12-plus months, is a solid additional evidence of a sustained and sustainable recovery. It's supported by growth in all of our end-use market. With public demand just beginning to strengthen, it is taking hold in more of our key market and is leading to volume gains in more of our key facilities, and it is supported by longer-term fundamentals, including sustained gains in construction employment, state and local revenue health, and early signs of rising wages and income. We will see some ebbs and flows in the rate of demand recovery and our shipment growth, but that's to be expected, particularly quarter-to-quarter. The first quarter reinforces an important point. This recovery is real. It's broad based and our geographic breadth and positioning will serve us well as recovery moves forward. The first quarter provided a clear snapshot of this fact. Our overall shipments grew more than 15% even though our Texas and California businesses were flat to down. This is another indicator of a recovery with real staying power. A second point is that our local teams throughout the company are not only executing well, they're also adapting well to changing market conditions. They have performed well and have maintained operating discipline and focus while challenged by rapidly increasing volumes. Their focus and ability to adapt, their expertise in balancing product mix, pricing and greater efficiencies day-to-day and week-to-week bode well for our future. It can be easy to lose our focus when adjusting and adapting to rising customer demands for quantity and quality of product, all the while hiring new staff and adjusting shift structures. And finally, you have some profitability tailwinds at your back, such as lower diesel costs and higher product pricing. There could be a tendency to lose some operating discipline, but this hasn't happened. When demand has risen, our plant level teams have adjusted just as quickly to meet customer needs. They're highly focused on the operating details, critical to our long-term success, and are acting with discipline to ensure peak operating efficiencies. Our sales teams have also responded effectively to ensure we're serving each market segment well, and our sales and operating teams have stayed coordinated in balancing production and demand. We're driving earnings while helping our customers grow. We're going to face some operating challenges as the recovery continues and as we grow. That's just the nature of operating more than 340 facilities across many states. But I take an extra measure of confidence from how well our teams have responded over the last two quarters. Finally, a third point that strikes me as I reflect on the quarter and trends in our business, that's the payoff from our aggregates focus and from our commitment to continuous, compounding improvement in all aspects of our business. We brought our division presidents, our senior line of leaders from around the country together recently. And one of the things we discussed was the importance of keeping our energy which is electric. I can tell you right now that our people remain driven hungry for growth and improved performance. Our people, many of whom have 15, 20, even 30-plus years in the business, know that we are a long way from more normal demand and the corresponding profitability in our business. We live this every day with many plants still running part-time and many crews still without full-time work. Our people are balancing immediate customer needs with the maintenance and investment required to serve the growth that is coming. So, our job is to keep tapping into that pride, that sense of ownership and competitive spirit in order to keep getting better day-in and day-out. And certainly, our shareholders benefit for this emphasis on continuous, compounding improvement. As you've seen, we continue to expand our margins faster than pricing alone. And that improvement drives better returns on capital and allows for financially sound reinvestment. Since recovery began in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment has improved $2, or 78% on a trailing 12-month basis. The drivers of this improvement are many and to some may seem dull, but the impact on our lasting franchise value is anything but dull. Having shared these observations, I'll now hand it over to John for some brief commentary regarding our outlook. John? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the headline which was also noted in our release. Our full-year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking toward the high end of that range. Now, looking at our first quarter results and at our momentum over the last few quarters, as well as listening to the comments Tom just shared, some of you may ask why are we not raising guidance at this time. Well, we'd like to be clear one more time that it's not because we lack confidence in the business' long-term fundamentals. If anything, that confidence has risen. And that's confidence in a recovery with multiple end-use segments and geographic drivers, and a constructive pricing climate allowing for more fair and adequate returns on capital as we move forward, and in our internal ability to execute and to adapt to changing market conditions, nor do we see any imminent threats that we're just failing to mention. Simply put, it's early, and we need to take some care not to over-interpret any single quarter's results. We caution against it. As we've said frequently before, we encourage investors to also focus on longer-term trends. We believe that help separate the signal from the noise, if you will. And for this reason, you see us incorporate trailing 12-month figures and other longer-term trend information into our release and supporting materials. With those caution shared, let me offer a few more comments regarding our current outlook for the balance of the year. We currently expect same-store aggregate shipments to be up 8% to 9% for fiscal year 2016 over fiscal year 2015. This compares to our early February expectation of about 7%. Certainly, our first quarter shipments evidenced underlying strength in demand even after adjusting for weather and other favorable factors. Publicly funded construction activity has shown some year-over-year strength, although the effects of the Federal FAST Act and recent state and local funding initiatives have for the most part yet to flow through the system. And some of our end customers appear to be adding some capacity, albeit prudently and gradually. Our updated same-store shipment growth expectation is roughly in line with the rate seen over the trailing-12 months. Again, we expect that growth rates will fluctuate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter as the recovery moves forward. That has been the pattern of this recovery and of past recoveries. So we're also seeing a recovery, although it has a good ways to go, that continues to see more geographic markets and more end-use segments participate fully. With respect to aggregates pricing, we continue to project year-over-year growth in freight-adjusted average selling prices of approximately 7%. First quarter prices showed approximately 2% sequential improvement over fourth quarter pricing. Price increases that took effect in January and as of April 1 were generally well accepted by the marketplace and in line with our beginning-of-year expectations. Aggregate unit margins should continue to expand faster than pricing, although the pace of that growth may vary quarter-to-quarter. As you saw in the first quarter, we're beginning to see some very good operating leverage as we leverage fixed cost to sales. And our overall cost performance of late, has benefited from lower diesel prices. Of course, those costs may rise as the year moves forward with some lag in corresponding product pricing. We continue to expect year-on-year gross profit growth in our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments of approximately 20%, collectively. Our local leaders continue to manage material margins in those businesses very well, although they may see some downward pressure from currently strong levels as the year moves forward. SAG costs were elevated in the first quarter, primarily due to incentive compensation-related accruals tied to our financial and stock price performance. We currently expect full-year SAG cost to remain roughly in line with our February guidance, and we will continue to leverage SAG expenses to revenues. Absent the effects of performance-based compensation and certain investments in our sales capabilities, overhead expenses have grown at an approximately 3% rate since 2013. Our target for core capital expenditure investments remains at $275 million for the year, although we may elect to pull forward some future spending if justified by compelling sourcing opportunities, for example, lower heavy equipment costs resulting from pressures across the global mining sector. You'll see $108 million of PP&E investment reflected in our Q1 financials. A couple of comments. We typically work to frontload our spending on heavy mobile equipment in part so that we can see the benefits of associated operating efficiencies during the heavy construction season. And the PP&E spending figures and the financials also includes certain internal growth capital investments. For example, ships to serve our Yucatan operation, development of new quarry site, and development of new distribution facilities such as the railyard we just opened in Savannah, Georgia. And including these internal growth investments, our total cash outlay for the year could be approximately $400 million. Vulcan's financial strength and flexibility allow for a balance of smart re-investment, pursuit of acquisition-led growth opportunities, and the ongoing return of capital to shareholders. Our overall capital structure and capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. During the first quarter, both S&P and Fitch raised our credit ratings to investment grade status. During Q1, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased 257,000 shares during the quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $103. I'll conclude my remarks by noting that our Q1 results represent another solid step toward our longer-term goals for the company's profitability when market demand recovers to long-term, normalized levels. Inside of Vulcan, we very much keep our eye on those longer-term goals. We have a lot of growth and a lot of work ahead of us. But the continuous, compounding improvements that Tom referred to have us well on track and well-prepared for the opportunities and challenges that will inevitably arise over the years to come. Tom, back over to you. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, John. I'd like to once again thank our people, many of whom listen to these calls, for their hard work and dedication. I congratulate you for accepting the challenge of finishing 2015 strong and then repeating that performance to kick off 2016. For those of you in the investment community, I'd like to assure you the response to these strong results is to sharpen our focus to control what we can control and stay committed to getting a little better every day. In the course of doing this, I want to emphasize that we remain very committed to pursuing strategic M&A opportunities as they arise, further strengthening our asset portfolio in high growth markets across America. We take confidence in what we've accomplished thus far in the recovery. And we have many opportunities ahead of us, but nobody is letting up. Taking just the basic measure of EBITDA, for example, while we're excited about our progress, we know that we still have a long way to go. And I can assure you that the Vulcan team is determined to reach our goals. Thank you again for your interest in Vulcan Materials. And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We'll go first to Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jerry. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Gentlemen, I'm wondering if you can comment about early indications of pricing cadence for April. Last year, you were able to push pricing sequentially over the course of the year, and you had a 3% increase sequentially 2Q versus 1Q. I'm wondering how is this year shaping out. Do you think you'll be able to push pricing over the course of this year once again? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. As you look at the first quarter, I think this was a really good start to pricing. It was pretty consistent how we thought pricing would be accepted throughout our markets and with our plan. Overall, the climate for pricing remains very healthy. I think the environment is good throughout the construction industry. In fact, we would see some pockets of tight supply. As the year goes on, we're going to comp over higher and higher prices with our success with that last year. But it's also about making profit in this business. It's about the balance of price mix and volume and that \u2013 and what's really important is that compounding effect of pricing. So I think, at this point, we're really pleased with our people's execution of their pricing plans, and we have really good confidence in our guys. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And can you talk about, on the public construction side, what's the speed of DOT request for bids turning into actual project where \u2013 how is that timeline shaking out? I guess on paper the DOT budgets look really good this year, and I'm wondering if you're seeing that materializing in terms of projects moving forward on time. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think the DOTs are working really hard and really fast to turn their funding into projects, not the least of which is because of the political pressures that they feel. I think that if you look at the new \u2013 most of the new DOT spending that went into law the last \u2013 over the last year, you're not going to see much of that in 2017. I think they're plugging hard to get it out there, maybe a little \u2013 excuse me, you're not going to see much of that in 2016. Most of that will come in 2017. You may see a little bit at the end of 2016. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But they're working hard to get it out... J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...if they can. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Very aggressive. And Jerry, back on pricing, just with an eye toward the longer term, to echo Tom's point, we do like the climate we see. Everything seems constructive, very much in line with recent experience. And importantly for us, we seem to be a bit ahead of track on both pricing and margin improvement as it relates to our longer-term goals that we outlined at our Investor Day. So we're pleased with the results we see and it's a compounding improvement again, so we're looking to get it better quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions today. Just there's been obviously a great deal focus on the public end market, but I wanted to switch gears in terms of what you're seeing in the non-res end market because there's been some speculation that \u2013 could that market continue growth as we've seen. So, to that end, what are you seeing in terms of market demand trends from non-res projects, color on growth rate either by the quarter or for the trailing six months, and the types of projects you're seeing growth, growing best in your most important markets? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Kathryn, we continuously grow with the non-res. We look at the leading indicators, but what we're seeing in our markets and backlogs, are our customers continues to be healthy. As far as growth rate is concerned, it may not be as fast as last year, but it's still growing. I think that one of the things you'll see here is that the res is growing at a very fast rate, and usually non-res, particularly the retail construction will follow that. So, on the ground, we continue to see the growth. We still have a number of the large projects that we'll ship this year on the coast, and we also see some pretty healthy manufacturing growth. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Kathryn, one thing we're seeing that's a bit of a shift or a transition is our local teams are seeing a lot of small commercial work that's really popping up, and it's difficult to predict. This kind of pops up and gets executed pretty quickly. But we're seeing that in a number of markets, including (24:27) Nashville. So we think that bodes well for the overall health, mix, sustainability of the recovery to see this uptick in small commercial work across many of our markets. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Great. Thank you. And then on Georgia, last quarter, volumes were up 20%-plus. Our checks have seen at least a similar, if not healthier growth rate there. What are you seeing in terms of just how that state performed? But also importantly, just revisiting the prior quarter question which is have you seen any pickup in increased funding from that state, just increased volumes from the funding that was passed last quarter? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Georgia is really hitting on all cylinders, every market segment is growing. It's very healthy, housing, non-res. The highway is \u2013 actually, we've got a number of jobs that were backlog \u2013 very large jobs that were backlog prior to the funding. The state DOT has had a lot of pressure on it to turn out jobs in the new funding. So we may see some overlay work towards the end of the year in Georgia. But the real \u2013 I think, the real hit of the doubling of Georgia's funding will come in 2017 and 2018. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. And final question on Texas. In the past conversations we've had, you had said that Texas is really the only market that's getting close to getting back to normal. Are there any other markets that are getting kind of back to that normal market? And then, also just for the benefit of folks on the call, if you could differentiate within Texas what markets are \u2013 or what you would view back to (26:11) normal and what percentage of your Texas revenues are in each of those markets? Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. First of all, Texas is the only market we have that's anywhere close to normal demand. As far as commenting on the market in Texas, it's \u2013 as you said, it's a big place with many different markets. Overall, it remains very healthy. Dallas and San Antonio are still very strong. We're seeing rural Texas gets stronger and that's a \u2013 we have a big presence there, particularly the asphalt presence and that's good for us because it's driven by the increases in highway funding and the damage that was done to the roads from all the oil explorations. Houston, we probably see some softening in res and non-res. It's a watch for us. The coastal work, we still have a lot of large work that we're shipping. There's a \u2013 when I say coastal, I mean from Brownsville to Beaumont. There's also \u2013 including Houston, there's also a number of jobs that are coming there. Now, timing of all that with big jobs, as always, you'll see ebbs and flows. But \u2013 so, overall, with the except for the watch on res and non-res, I'd tell you Texas markets are healthy. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Trey Grooms of Stephens. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Congrats on a great quarter. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Good morning. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Thank you, Trey. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: So, looking at \u2013 I guess kind of sticking with the geographic theme here, can you talk about how the geographic mix that you're seeing as well as product mix could be impacting your pricing and kind of your expectation there as we look through the balance of the year? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Trey, for the quarter and as we look for the balance of the year, they are really in total, I'm going to call it, geographic and product or customer mix issues were kind of awash. So, there's really no big impact in that in our pricing for the quarter. Back on the geographic point and really the broadening of the recovery, we do see more of our, if you will, Atlantic Coast markets and Southeast markets, really beginning to participate in the recovery more and more fully across more end-use segments. How exactly that plays out in terms of price and product mix impact over the course of the year, we'll have to see. But that's not a big driver and the pricing or margin results you've seen of late. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got you. Okay. And then on California being down, I mean, it sounded like in the fourth quarter that was a pretty good market for you, and then you noted seeing a slowdown there, and you pointed out some infrastructure work. Is that just timing? And then I know weather was obviously a factor there. Can you talk about kind of what the California market looks like when weather is cooperating for you guys? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. As we said, California was hit really hard in the first quarter with rain. We still see solid growth in demand in California. Short term, we could see some issues with Caltrans funding or timing of work. I think the good news for us about California is that market is very diverse. Our out (29:32) markets in California are very diverse. So this year on top of healthy residential market growth, we'll see a number of water projects, high-rise projects and airport projects start in 2016. So what I'd tell you is overall, long-term, we believe that the California will continue to experience sustainable growth. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. It's helpful. And then the last one for me is, I think that you had \u2013 when you first gave your guidance on your 4Q call, you had expected volumes to be more kind of back-half weighted. But obviously, with the big volume quarter now you guys just put up, just trying to think about how that changes your expectation for the quarterly cadence or kind of how the volumes kind of shake out as we progress through the year. And then with that, the obvious question we've been getting, do you think there was any pull-forward from some of these stronger markets that benefited from weather, kind of pulling forward into 1Q from 2Q or some other period? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Trey, it's John. I'll start and Tom could chime in. On the guidance, what we're trying to note is some of the El Nino-related weather effects that we did in fact see. And of course, you saw our \u2013 both our California businesses, and some of our Mountain West businesses, and a little bit Texas affected by that. In addition, as Tom just mentioned, we had a bit of a low on some large public construction work in California. But then, of course, despite those challenges on the volume side, we posted the results you saw today. It's difficult to say if we had a little bit of pull-forward or a little bit of, I'm going to call it, overflow from 2015 where, for example, in North Carolina and South Carolina, some fourth quarter shipments were delayed by the bad weather they had. But as best we can tell, however, you adjust for it, we are seeing some strengthening in demand across more geographies, across more end-use segments. And as a result, you've seen us move our expectation for the year from 7% growth to 8% to 9% growth, in line roughly with what we've experienced over the last 12 months. We're seeing a recovery that still has a ways to go, but has more and more engines driving it, if you will. I think... Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's it for me. Thanks a lot, guys. Keep up the good work. Operator : We'll go next to Garik Shmois of Longbow. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Thanks and congratulations. You called out in the press release that you're starting to win share on large projects. And I remember a year ago at the Analyst Day when you indicated that this is \u2013 part of the strategy is we work through the recovery. It seems like it's bearing fruit. I was wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit more context around where you are with your share gain platform as it pertain to perhaps the quarter and the last 12 months? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. If you remember, I think what we said was we \u2013 I think we probably lost some share in the downturn, and it's always \u2013 as the markets come back, we'll recover that. As the recovery continues to mature, you'll see higher and higher shipments in the really high growth quarters in our markets, which is where we are. So, naturally, those jobs will be in our zone of natural advantage, so to speak, we're located. You'll also \u2013 we're also seeing more and more very, very large jobs, both commercial and highway work, and those also fall right in our wheelhouse. So it's just a natural recovery as the market returns. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : So, Garik, it's a little \u2013 it's a little hard for us to quantify that, especially kind of at this timeframe in the recovery. But as Tom said, I think it wouldn't surprise us if you're beginning to see some of the larger, more sophisticated producers recovering a little bit of share that they gave up in the downturn. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. Just want to switch to some of the cost buckets within aggregates. Specifically, is it possible to indicate what your diesel cost was in the quarter? And then also on repair and maintenance, it has been trending up over the last several quarters. It was up again in the first quarter. Can you provide an outlook on R&M costs as you move through the balance of the year? Is it still going to be elevated on a year-on-year basis, or will some of those costs start to plateau? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Sure. I'll start, Garik, and then Tom will chime in, in just an attempt to give you some more color as best we can. Again, first thing we'd highlight that is if you look on a trailing 12-month basis, even excluding the positive effects of diesel, our overall unit cost of sales is essentially flat. So what's really behind that, if you take a \u2013 again, a trailing 12-month view is that our teams are doing a great job and they've been able to get some real operating leverage as volumes have increased, and that's offset some of the cost pressures that come from higher R&M that we've been talking about. So all in all, they're doing a great job. We've really seen that for the last two quarters. We hope to keep seeing it going forward. We'll keep an eye on it. But we're certainly very pleased to see that cost performance. In the quarter, our average diesel price is probably about $1.30, probably $5 million, $6 million benefit from that in total. But, again, what we'd underscore. And then our R&M in the quarter, as we said, it was still elevated. To give you a rough order of magnitude, the way we look at it, it's probably $0.08 up per ton. So that's an issue we manage tightly. We keep an eye on it. But in the context of our overall margin structure, it's not a defining characteristic. So again, we'll continue to manage it well. Our team is doing a great job. We're beginning to see some real operating leverage. And importantly, even excluding the benefits of diesel, we've been able to keep cost relatively flat. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'd tell you, I'm not surprised to see R&M cost at this point in the cycle and that may continue for a while. We're still playing catch-up on putting plants up, run the plants harder. We've got to remember we're still in the early stages of this, a lot has been on gradual recovery. The volumes are still \u2013 the rather recovery is still early. I think what \u2013 as John said, what I'm pleased to see is that over the last 12-plus months or five quarters, we're seeing a trend of the other cost and the operating efficiencies start to improve which tells me that we're leveraging the volume not only on fixed cost, but also on some of the variable cost and the operating efficiency. So, to John's point, I think our folks are doing a really good job adjusting and adapting to rapidly changing volumes. We have a long way to go. And I think that as this continues to mature in the recovery, we'll continue to see that fixed cost and variable cost volume leverage. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : That's super helpful. Last question is just quickly on the asphalt volumes that declined in the quarter. Was that mainly driven by some of the commentary that you indicated that California had experienced over the last quarter? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. California asphalt was hit hard. You just can't lay it obviously in the rain. I think we're pleased with our overall asphalt performance. Despite California being down, Texas volumes were up, driven by \u2013 a lot by both textile work and private markets. I think we \u2013 our folks have done a good job of managing a mix of price, cost of material margins and all the while serving our customers, and that's tough to do in the first quarter with icy weather. So even with California down, I think we're pleased with our performance in asphalt for sure. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks, guys. Good luck. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Thanks, Garik. Operator : We'll go next to James Armstrong of Vertical Research. James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Good start to the year. Congrats. First question I had is on the weather impact as we go into the second quarter. Obviously, the South has been really, really wet in places. Are you seeing any impact of that as we go into the second quarter, or have you been able to pretty much overcome that so far? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Obviously, April has been wet. Anybody can look at the weather and tell that. But we would always tell you that we're going to \u2013 quarter-over-quarter or even month-over-month, yes, you're going to have weather, yes, you're going to have things that will affect you positively and negatively, but you can't judge it quarter-over-quarter or month-over-month. You really got to look at long term. So regardless of what the weather does, the demand is there, and if they don't \u2013 if it gets delayed, it's not going away. It's just postponed. And it always catches up and it always happens. But month-to-month, we're going to have periods of good weather and bad weather. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : And, James, we're not going to comment on April sales on this call. So, we'll talk about that in our next call. James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. And then going to asphalt, margins were absolutely fantastic there in the quarter. Should those continue or should those come under a little bit of pressure as oil prices start to march up? And can you talk about the lag in asphalt and oil? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. If you look at the \u2013 the quarter material margins are probably a little ahead of schedule \u2013 a little ahead of our expectations. We could see some pressures with \u2013 as \u2013 the changing liquid AC prices. Again, I think our folks are doing a really good job of managing that, and this is a balance of volume, price, cost of material margins. So \u2013 and there is a lag there, we're trying to predict what that is and how that is. Asphalt sometimes runs through the cadence of it and sometimes it doesn't, but we'll manage that as it comes along. James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer of BB&T Capital Markets. Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets : Hey. Good morning, guys. I'd also say congrats. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Adam. Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets : I wanted to ask about firstly on M&A. Maybe some updated thoughts on that, you putting your investment grade rating to work. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : First of all, I'd tell you that we are in a \u2013 we are very pleased with the purchases we made over the last 18 months and how they performed, and they performed very well. The M&A market continues to be healthy. We continue to be \u2013 so, it's a huge focus for us. It's something that we pay a lot of attention to. We're very busy with it. Obviously, we can't talk about anything we're working on, but we'll let you know when that happens and when those come \u2013 when those finalize. But it's healthy. We're focused on it and it's a priority for us. Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets : Would you \u2013 are you going to preference either the smaller deals or larger deals at this point in the cycle? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We'll \u2013 I think what we look at and what we concentrate is what fits us both large and small, what are \u2013 is unique synergies to us and making sure that we buy it for the right price and then we integrate it, so it's both. Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then, also as we think about 2017 and the potential for DOT work to benefit from the FAST Act. Is there anything we should be aware of in terms of whether pricing on that work is lower or maybe the incremental margin opportunity on that work is less, maybe just some color on that would be helpful? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think that the impact of DOT spending both state and federal coming to fruition, and shipments will only help pricing. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : And of course, not just \u2013 we'd always encourage you to focus \u2013 you and anybody, not just to focus on pricing, but overall margin performance. And that volume, that mix, that's good for our overall balance of price. The operating efficiencies, product mix, let's just say, we're looking forward to it. Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets : Great. Thank you very much. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Hey. Good morning, guys. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Hey, Timna. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : These should be fairly quick. We've talked about a lot of these topics, but I just wanted to touch on 2017 because some of the independent forecast for non-residential construction have been tapering their enthusiasm into 2017. So is that just maybe excess enthusiasm on their part or is there something that you might be able to help us understand about tapering in 2017 activity, whether that be some of the big projects rolling off or anything else? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Timna, honestly, we haven't given any guidance for 2017. So just with that qualification first, I think where we come back to in case it's helpful is what we see if you will on the ground. And the momentum that we're seeing overall as it relates to private construction and private non-res is \u2013 is largely unchanged. I mean, there are going to be specific geographic markets, for example, Houston, that with layoffs, et cetera, we keep an eye on. But in total, we still like the momentum we see, the breadth of the recovery, the breadth of the end markets, the higher levels of small commercial work that we see. So from our kind of humble on the ground view, the death of non-res has been announced prematurely. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think on the housing piece, the housing recovery still remains pretty modest compared to historical cycles. And most forecasters would expect it to continue to gain steam, so \u2013 and non-res will follow that. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : And the large project pipeline we have seen as it relates to larger industrial projects, still largely unchanged. So, again, we obviously keep a close eye on it. We haven't \u2013 we're ways away from anything that we consider 2017 guidance in our part. But what we do see, and we've talked about more for 2017 also, is just the beginning of the increase in public construction beginning to kick in, strengthening public demand, and we're kind of getting to the point in the cycle where that's beginning to kick in a bit more also. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. The other question is about your high quality problem which is a very low dividend yield. And I understand that you just doubled your dividend, but I was just wondering if you could talk around the way you think about it philosophically, and is there a target yield, is there something that drives the way your board thinks about the dividend or the right level of it? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Sure. I'll start. I think you're right, a high quality problem to have. First, we're focused again on balancing re-investment in the business, investment in growth, including the M&A opportunities that Tom discussed, and ongoing return on capital to shareholders. We think we have the financial flexibility and strength to balance those goals over time. We do not have a target dividend yield. And it's really a board decision as to revisit it, of course, periodically. We do think of it in the context of overall return of capital to shareholders and balancing those other objectives very much including growth. But we do not have a target dividend yield. We do expect our payout ratio over time will be roughly consistent with companies of our credit rating and size. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. You don't have any more notes due until 2018, so how would you characterize the use of cash flow the next couple of years between acquisitions, debt pay-down and share repurchase? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : Our capital allocation and cash usage priorities have really remained unchanged from prior communications. So just to briefly echo some of those, one, we have intentionally managed our balance sheet so that we have the kind of flexibility that you just mentioned. We will make the appropriate operating capital investments back in the business to maintain the value of our franchise. We do not expect to need to use cash to pay down debt. Obviously, we don't have maturities due in the near term, but we're comfortable with our current level of debt. We will continue to pursue growth opportunities aggressively, whether those are M&A related or, as we mentioned in our release and in our comments, whether they are internally driven growth opportunities, investments in new railyards, new quarry sites, the kind of things that we would do internally. We have several opportunities there. We \u2013 to the point the question just asked on the dividend, we would expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with our earnings for a while. We're very focused on the sustainability of that dividend throughout the entire cycle. And then as we said before, we will be opportunistic as we go forward and potentially using share repurchases or other means to return any excess cash to shareholders after those other priorities. Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: In acquisitions, would those be in the current footprint, or are you willing to look outside the current footprint for the right opportunity? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : To answer your question, both, and we've done both. Some of our highest returns on capital are the bolt-ons because they complement your existing operations and they defend some of your existing \u2013 the operations. But we'll look outside of our footprint. I mean, we just did that with New Mexico over the last 18 months. But I think would we go outside our footprint, we would want to go in as a number one or number two producer, or a path to be number one or number two. So \u2013 but to answer your question, it's both. Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Betts with Jefferies. Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Thank you very much. I'd like to come back on the cost question please. And looking at the $0.68 per ton saving in Q1, I think that equates to about $27 million. You've kindly explained diesel's saving of $5 million or $6 million, and I think the R&M was an offset of about $3 million. So, I'm still missing a big number there, sort of $24 million, $25 million. Is that all operating leverage because the volume growth was so high or is there anything else there? That's kind of my first question. My second question, when we're looking at the full year in terms of costs, you highlighted the trailing 12-month flat cost. Is that a pretty decent assumption to make for the full year? Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think that to start with your first question, I think it's a combination of operating leverages and improved volumes and operating efficiencies on the variable side. So, it's a combination of both of them. There is a lot of volume leverage in that, but it's a combination of the two. Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Are there any one-offs in there? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : (50:19). J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think one of the things, timing of stripping, Mike, I would say maybe had some benefit of it that will \u2013 that's always comes in, get some stars, but it's not a whole lot. Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Okay. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : And, Mike, for the full-year outlook, we'll see. We're very focused, as Tom mentioned, on continuing to drive these operating efficiencies to control what we can control, to use Tom's words, and to leverage our cost of sales where we can. We'll see how it come out. There are a lot of moving pieces in the business like ours, but it's something we're very, very focused on. Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Question back on the cost side, at what point do you start to add more and more shifts, is this kind of more later in this year or into next year, and \u2013 or maybe think about it, can you meet the 9% sort of same-store sales growth on the existing head count maybe running a little bit of over time? Just, how do we think about adding shift work on a go-forward basis? J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, I wish we were running two shifts everywhere. I'm a little operator guy. And that \u2013 that's \u2013 life is good if that happens. I think that \u2013 but it's on a market-by-market, plant-by-plant basis. So for example, you've got \u2013 if you go to Texas, you've got plants that are running two shifts already. You go to some markets in our some of our Atlanta operations, they're running \u2013 they're not even running full shifts. So, it's such a local business and that is market-by-market. So there's not a broad-based statement. But I don't \u2013 overall, we'll do that a little bit at a time, but we're nowhere close in most markets to adding shifts. It's really adding hours or even adding a full shift on a \u2013 a full shift on a full plant, but we would love to have those problems. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's great news. John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : We also, Stanley, back to Mike's point, we're probably getting \u2013 with the breadth of the recovery, we're probably getting to a point where we have enough volume and more of our key facilities to begin to realize a little more operating leverage, leverage and fixed cost. Now, we're long ways away, and Tom, we discussed it from many kind of operating sweet spot, and we're even further away from production capacity. But one of the benefits to us of getting more volume and more places is that it helps on the fixed cost leverage. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. And on the growth CapEx piece, I think it was like $125 million for Savannah and for the ships. I imagine the cost realization is pretty immediate when all this starts to flow through. But how should we think about that? Does that pick up more into next year, or is that even kind of more into \u2013 closer to 2018 when you start to see the cost savings from these investments really start to come through? John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer : I'll break it into two pieces for you. Think about \u2013 of the $275 million of operating and maintenance CapEx, for many of those investments, we begin to see operating efficiencies pretty darn quick if we are improving or right-sizing mobile equipment fleet, if we're replacing screens or otherwise improving our production processes at a plant level. We try and work those as best we can to have pretty quick return periods on those investments. For the $125 million, for the course of the year that we may spend on growth-related PP&E, it's really going to depend on the nature of the investment. These aren't long-term payoff things. These aren't things where you invest one year and you get the benefit 10 years down the road. But it's highly variable whether it's a new railyard or incremental reserve capacity at a quarry or whether it's a new ship, so it's hard to say on the growth capital. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No. Fair enough. Great, guys, and congratulations. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks. J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company, and we look forward to speaking with you throughout the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

Davidson Jim Margard - Rainier Investment Management Operator : Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Sherlon, and I will be the conference call coordinator today. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren please begin. Mark Warren : Good morning everyone and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO, and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this Webcast and on our Web site supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide, Tom and John will summarize the highlights. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. With that said please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of Federal, State and Local funding for infrastructure, the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry, and other risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our Earnings Release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom? Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark. And thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Our business continues to perform very well, even with a slower rate of shipment growth in the second quarter, our margins continued to improve considerably. We remain on track, consistent with our guidance to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. The fundamentals of the business continued to strengthen. I'll mention three areas in particular. One, the factors underpinning the continued gradual recovery and demand remains intact, notably, with higher levels of public funding, supporting further growth in 2017 and beyond. Two, our internal execution remains very solid. We're meeting our customers rising needs and we're balancing volumes, pricing and product mix. Our teams are continuing to do an outstanding job converting incremental revenue into profits. And three, the core profitability of the business continues to improve, trading 12-month gross profit per ton in our aggregate segment increased by 31% to $4.77 per ton and adjusted EBIT on a trailing 12-month basis increased 62% to $682 million. So, the foundation for multi-year growth continues to strengthen in demand outlook, in execution and in our core profitability. Now, regarding second quarter shipments. I want to reiterate a point made in last quarters earnings call. A single quarter's result doesn't always give a good picture of the underlying volume trends in the business. Now obviously, the 3% growth rate for aggregates shipments in the quarter contrast sharply with the first quarter rate of 17%. Prolonged bad weather in certain markets, large project timing, sales mix and other factors can cause our business results to vary substantially week-to-week and month-to-month. Certainly, we've seen that variability over the last two quarters but the underlying drivers and the basic trends remain unchanged. For example, if we pull back to look at just the first half of the year as opposed to looking at two quarters individually, we see that our core aggregates business has posted shipment growth of 9% over the first half of 2016 and pricing growth of 8%. Those results are in line with recent trends and with our plans for the year. I'll comment in more detail on individual geographies during Q&A. But taken as a whole, the bottom line is that we still see our core demand drivers and longer term project pipelines strengthening across our footprint. In fact, we anticipate sustained growth in all end use segments, even though we've yet to see much benefit in terms of shipments from rising public funding. We'll see continued recovery in private construction. Public funding will start to pick up in an important way by 2017 and beyond, as states commit to large long-term projects on the strength of the FAST Act and we see a healthy number of large projects that we will serve in the queue for 2017 and 2018. Now moving back to the second quarter. Just as a number of factors combined to boost the rate of shipment growth in the first quarter, several factors combined to affect shipments in the second quarter. We saw extremely wet weather in several key markets. At the same time, certain markets experienced a lull in large project starts both public and private. This was despite a healthy pipeline of projects and in retrospect, it's likely that some work was pulled forward into the first quarter. As you know, we typically see a fairly high degree of variance in shipment patterns across our individual markets, particularly month-to-month, but I think it's fair to say that the second quarter brought with it a higher than normal degree of variance. The second quarter could be seen as a story of the haves and the have-nots. Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois combined saw aggregate shipments decline by 10% versus the prior year, while the remainder of our states combined grew shipments by 14%. We continue to see strong shipment growth across most of the Southeast where the recovery has really begun to take hold over recent quarters and certain of these states for example, Georgia have put in place higher levels of public funding that will support higher materials demand in 2017 and beyond, even though we haven't seen much of that impact yet. For California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, we've seen a mix of weather and large project timing impacting year-over-year shipment rates. All of those specifics vary by State and market. I'd note that California, Texas and Virginia each have healthy longer term growth prospects and what we're experiencing now is more transitional or timing related issues. In contrast, we don't currently see a similar path to longer term demand growth in Illinois. Due to that states well known fiscal challenges, although our team there has done a nice job of growing its profits and cash flows. I mentioned the significant fluctuations in shipment rates month-to-month throughout the quarter. As you saw in our press release during May, this resulted in daily shipments declining by about 5% from the prior year. On the other hand daily shipments rates in April and June were up approximately 8% and 6% respectively. These kind of fluctuations are not uncommon. All the more reason to avoid extrapolating from short-term volume trends in a business such as ours. Even though these swings in shipments activity at the local level can create some operational challenges, our teams have done a superb job adapting to changing market conditions and consistently meeting our customers' needs. So ultimately I don't find the recent spikes and lulls in demand to be a great concern. It's just the nature of the business. Regarding our local teams ability to adapt to changing market conditions, I'm pleased with the way our people are delivering continued profitability gains despite modest overall shipment growth and shifting delivery in production schedules. Regarding pricing; our average price freight adjusted selling prices for aggregates in the quarter were up 7% over the prior year, despite some headwinds from geographic and product mix. Meanwhile, our unit costs of sales were flat and unit cash gross profit per ton increased $0.86 or 15% from last year's quarter. Our incremental flow through rate exceeded 80% for the quarter and 75% on a trailing 12-month basis. We also enjoyed healthy margin expansion in our asphalt and our concrete segments, despite low rates of volume growth. On a total company basis and excluding the impact of freight and delivery revenues, gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 500 basis points over last year's second quarter. Those are strong results and they aren't one offs. They represent a next step on a long-term path of continuous compounding improvement. We provided additional information regarding our longer term profit improvements and our release and the supplemental slides. So I won't repeat that here. Other than to highlight that on a trailing 12-month basis, our gross profit per ton and our core aggregates segment has increased by 87% or $2.22 per ton since the recovery began in 2013. Now, before handing it off to John, I'd like to share a few thoughts regarding our expected results for the balance of the year. As I've already noted we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We finished the first quarter trending towards the higher end of that range although we gave some of that back during the second quarter. We continue to expect full year aggregate shipments to exceed 190 million tons, but our ultimate results will depend in large part on three things, just as was the case in the second half of 2015. One, on the ability of our customers to catch up on weather delayed work. Two, on the start and completion timing of larger projects, and three, on the number of shipping days allowed by weather conditions particularly in the fourth quarter. The demand fundamentals are there and strengthening. The pricing and unit profitability is there. It's on track and it's growing, so then it's really a matter of timing, how we finish will largely depend on how much of the work that is clearly there can be completed by the end of the year before we move into 2017 where demand will only grow. Let me sum it up. We saw a strong first half with 9% shipment growth and 8% pricing growth in our core aggregate segmented. Longer term demand fundamentals are in place, pointing towards a strong scenario developing for 2017. In the near-term, we've seen rapid growth across the Southeast but a lull in large project activity in parts of California, Texas and Illinois. We are benefiting from excellent continued improvements to our core profitability, even during a quarter with slower volume growth. The pricing climate remains positive and as was the case last year, we need to make up for some weather delayed volumes in the second half. I'll come back in a moment with some final remarks, but for now let me hand it off to John for a few brief comments regarding our overall cost controls, our balance sheet strength and our capital allocation priorities. John? John McPherson : Thanks, Tom. I'd like to start with one more complement to our local teams and their operational performance and cost control discipline throughout the early stage of the cycle. Although we have had and will likely continue to have ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, the overall cost trend has been impressive. For example, in our core aggregates segment, our unit cost of sales per ton as measured on a trailing 12-month basis, has declined consistently with each reporting period since the recovery began in the second half of 2013. So over a three year period, when our average selling price for a ton of aggregates increased by about $1.64, again measured on a trailing 12-month basis, our average unit cost of sales declined by about $0.57. Lower diesel prices have aided these results, but strong daily operating disciplines, effective coordination among local production and sales teams and a commitment to continuous improvement have also played a central role. We often talk about how seemingly small improvements compound and add up to a sizeable impact on our business and in this case, our ongoing local operating disciplines have contributed meaningfully to the strong conversion of incremental revenue and to incremental profit that we've reported throughout the recovery so far. Unfortunately, we cannot make entirely similar observations regarding our SAG costs, despite the fact that we've held administrative headcount basically flat since the recovery began. As you've seen, second quarter SAG was $13.5 million higher than the prior year. A bit more than half of this increase results from the amount and timing of accruals for performance based incentives and deferred compensation plans. Approximately another quarter of the rise in second quarter SAG resulted from higher salaries and relocation expenses, primarily related to investments in our sales and business development talent and the strategic rotation of sales leadership across geographies. We will continue to make strategic investments in our sales talent and capabilities. Those costs and higher incentive accruals will cause run rate SAG costs to be elevated in the near-term, with our full year projection now at $310 million. Although we are not fully satisfied with our recent results and trend, we will continue to leverage SAG to sales throughout the recovery and beyond. The investments we're making are sound and ultimately support a higher volume growth at higher margins. I'll touch now briefly on our balance sheet strength as the facts have continued to improve but the fundamental story remains unchanged. Our stated goal as you know is to maintain an investment grade credit position throughout the cycle. We have achieved such a position. And of course, our cash flow profile continues to improve. In short, we have the financial strength and flexibility needed to pursue a balanced mix of capital reinvestment, growth investments including M&A, and return of capital to shareholders. Finally, I'll note that our weighted average cost of capital has declined significantly since the recovery began, in part due to our improving financial performance and credit position and in part due to our focus on aggregates and the divestiture of our cement and concrete assets from our portfolio. Turning now to capital allocation. Our summary message is that our recent and planned activities remain consistent with the priorities you've heard us articulate several times. We do remain active in terms of business development and the pursuit of acquisition opportunities that fit us strategically. And I think it is fair to say that we are aggressive but disciplined. We're looking at a number of opportunities at various stages of development, and again, we have the financial capacity to grow without overly straining our credit position. And we have continued to return additional capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As you know, we have not committed to a specific repurchase target. Instead we will remain opportunistic and seek to balance a return of capital and reinvestment over time. And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thanks, John. Before taking your questions, I'd like to say a few words about my confidence in our company. I've been with this company for over 26 years and I believe our business is stronger and more resilient than it's ever been. We're in the midst of a sustained multi-year recovery. We're enjoying an ongoing recovery in private construction and on top of that, we are just beginning to see a new wave of increased public spending. We'll highlight these demand trends for 2017 and beyond during our aggregates date event on September 29. We have an amazing aggregates focused asset base that positions us extremely well to serve the demand growth that is coming. Our core profitability and cash flows are very strong and just keep improving. Our balance sheet is strong. Our financial condition gives us a lot of flexibility to do smart M&A, to reinvest in our operations and to return capital to our shareholders. And our culture at this company is great. Our people are helping each other get better every day and they are upbeat and they are on their game. Our position is frankly an enviable one, especially when viewed against the back drop of uncertain times and I really like our position looking out over the next several years. At some point, our country must address the major infrastructure challenges that we still face as a nation. Look, it's good to have a five-year federal highway bill, but we still have a degraded highway system. Major U.S. infrastructure investment must and will occur eventually, whether as a matter of smart proactive economic policy, reactive fiscal stimulus, dire necessity, or some combination of these. We don't assume such a scenario in our longer term outlook, but we will be well positioned to meet that need when it arises. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our business and are focused on making a strong franchise even stronger. Let me conclude by thanking our outstanding employees for their performance during the quarter and for the work they continue to do every day to deliver another year of very strong results. And thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. Now, if the Operator will give the required instructions we'll be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Kathryn Thompson, Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Thompson : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. Tom Hill : Good morning, Kathryn. Kathryn Thompson : Good morning. First going to focus on more specific states. For Georgia in particular how much of your strength was driven by the new funding initiatives with House Bill 170, new rail lines in Savannah, or just overall improved economic health of the State. Just really helping us to balance because each of those are different types of buckets one being a new business opportunity, one being new funding and one is just day-to-day business. Tom Hill : At this point Kathryn, it's all just organic growth in Georgia. You aren't seeing flow through from the new highway funding. Might see a little bit towards the end of this year, but that's really going to be 2017 and 2018, so that's just really healthy growth in Georgia. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. And nothing really from the new rail line to Savannah? Tom Hill : Not at this point. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. Flipping to two states that were softer, California, Virginia. Virginia we were well aware of some of the wet weather, but specifically addressing those two states, to what degree were volumes impacted by large project delays, wet weather or any other relevant factor we should take into consideration and if you're able to comment on how trends are progressing in each of those states as we go into Q3. Tom Hill : Yes. I think if you're asking me, do we see some kind of change or deceleration in demand growth in these states or -- the answer is no. Both the private side, residential is very healthy, non-res saw a little bit of softening in the second quarter, but the leading indicators in the pipeline very healthy. The public side will only get better. We'll see a little bit of a lull in California while they are responding. But overall, we don't see any deceleration in either one of these states. I think that take them one at a time. California very positive. Our strength there is large commercial and highway projects. We saw a lull in that of recent, commercial side some of our customers maybe didn't pick up as much work of late as we would have liked. In Canada, we can do a better job with that. On the highway side, we'll see a little bit of a short-term decrease in funding because of gas price, lower gas prices, but that's got to rectify itself. California is rated the worst roads in the U.S. There's a number of bills in the State government for funding from roughly $3.5 billion -- increase of $3.5 billion up to $7 billion. And then there's I think around more than 10 measures that are on the ballot for November for local and county work that would total roughly an increase -- annual increase of about $2 billion. So overall, California is going to be fine. Virginia as you said we saw extreme weather and also had a little bit of timing with projects we had two big projects last year the midtown tunnel and a large wind farm that was going. We had one pushback this year the Fairfield marine terminal. But, just to give you a little flavor around that. If you took three large jobs that are coming I66 in Northern Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay bridge job, and the Fairfield marine which I just mentioned, that would be -- put those jobs together you're going to be around 7 million tons. So demand in Virginia will continue to grow. John McPherson : And Kathryn, it's John. Just to put a little more color on the four states we called out and just to give you support, and again, to echo Tom's point, we do not see any cyclical change here in these states or across our portfolio. Really the only one if you back up and take a trailing 12-month look that's down on volume for us is Illinois. And we've talked about Illinois before that's just a bit of a different fiscal picture rolling over some large projects that we didn't have this year that we did have last year. That's the one place the demand growth outlook just isn't as clear. Everything else that we're calling out is primarily a timing issue. It's weather related, it's pulling work forward into the first quarter, or it's just how large projects get started and they flow through the pipeline so Illinois is a little bit different but everywhere else is basically on the same track that its been. Kathryn Thompson : And Illinois, how should we think about modeling Illinois not just for the next quarter, but for 2016 and what's your view going forward and how we should think about modeling Illinois volume? Is it a situation where we should expect a decline or flat, any color would be helpful? Thank you. Tom Hill : We probably expect in Illinois and I'll make sure we follow-up on this with you. But, just to give you a sense, I'd expect flat to kind of low single digit growth from where we are today. Going forward, so it's not rapid decline, it's just not the same kind of growth on the shipment side. Now the other thing we call out in these states, California, Texas, Virginia, Illinois of note is the businesses are still strong, so don't take near-term volume challenges as fundamental business challenges. I mean just to give you a sense, those four states had pricing growth over the last 12 months in the double digits. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. Tom Hill : They had improvement in cash margin per ton over the last 12 months over 20%. And so the businesses are good and sound. It's just a question of project timing and flow. Virginia for example, was up strongly in volume in the first quarter over 20%. So we probably pulled some work forward there. We call it Illinois because it's the one place we just don't see the same kind of longer term robust growth that we see in rest of our portfolio. Kathryn Thompson : Okay, great. And final question for me today. You talked about mix and geographic mix having an impact on average pricing in the quarter. Are you able to give a little bit more granularity of which was a greater factor in the quarter? Thank you. Tom Hill : I think it was a combination of the two. We saw shipments get impacted in coastal Texas with weather, extreme weather and some timing of projects, it's healthy pricing, so that was geographic. And then, you saw some substantial base jobs and shot rock jobs particularly in Florida, so you put all those together was just under a percent. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Hi, good morning, everyone. Tom Hill : Good morning. John McPherson : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if you could just say more about what you saw demand by end-market across your footprint sounds like private non-res may have slowed, can you just flush that out for us either based on shipments in the quarter or based on indications that you're hearing from your customers? Thanks. Tom Hill : Yes. I think what we've seen is the growth in recent activities weakened just a little bit. Longer term our backlogs are growing, the pipeline has strengthened, employment levels and other factors point to sustained growth and at any given time that activity at different geographies will vary pretty widely. But, if you look at the leading indicators, the Dodge Momentum Index, ABI, they point to renewed pace of growth in 2017 and beyond. And then just simple fact that you've got single-family construction growing at the pace it's growing will pull non-res up and that we'll see that coming. Jerry Revich : Okay. Tom Hill : Our shipments to private non-res work in the quarter were still pretty healthy. So they can vary market-to-market. But I think we've all probably called the death of non-res spending prematurely several times now. Even if we see a little bit of weakness in near-term start indicators with our customers, and then, the data we look at we're seeing just as much if not more strength in the longer term pipelines. We still see growth across all of the India segments we are talking about. With the one thing that surprised us being slow kind of jumps out is really public infrastructure spending. So again, the outlook there is strong, but we haven't seen as much in public infrastructure as we would expect it so far this year giving all the fundamentals, all of the fundamentals are there, but the spending really hasn't been quite where we thought it would have been. Jerry Revich : And John, Tom, can you say more about that last point? Is it an issue of timing in terms of some bigger jobs getting started or getting the bidding process done, what are you seeing as driving that delay and how broad based is it? John McPherson : On the infrastructure piece, it's really just now you're starting to see the big capital projects, water, airports those kind of projects. If you look at tax receipts in our markets they are at or near all-time highs. So it's going to happen. It's just a matter of timing and I think the local governments making the decision to go forward with the capital projects. But you'll see that come on in 2017 and probably more in 2018. Jerry Revich : Okay. John McPherson : And it's a little bit of -- I'm going to call it a little bit of conjecture from us Jerry. But, we at least hear some comments about just I'm going to call it overall election cycle uncertainty, putting some near term breaks, some public infrastructure spending in some places. But again, as Tom said some of the spending on things like sewers and water infrastructure is not even really discretionary if you're going to build as much new residential, as we are building you are going to have to build new water. So it's really a question of timing in our view, but its one area that so far in 2016 we haven't seen the kind of growth we would have expected. Jerry Revich : Okay. And lastly, I'm wondering if you can comment on how volumes and pricing looked in July, so May obviously stands out as a month of downside in the quarter. Can you just give us some context on how July looked? John McPherson : Well, Jerry I'll jump in and say as the CFO that we can't comment on the third quarter yet. But in the spirit of that question, I guess one thing I'd note is, if May had had the same kind of shipping rate trends that we had seen in June and April, you would probably have a very different feel to this call and results. We wouldn't be asking some of these questions. So as Tom said it's not uncommon to have some variability in shipping rates week-to-week, month-to-month in a business it's all outdoors. But again, we haven't seen anything from our view that would indicate any kind of deceleration or anything that would take us off long-term trend. This is still a business with solid outlook for 2016, strengthening visibility for 2017 and in our view multiple years of growth ahead of us. Jerry Revich : All right. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Bob Wetenhall, RBC Capital Markets. Bob Wetenhall : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to -- and maybe this is for John. You guys had commented on your last conference call that the high-end of the range for capital spending would be around $400 million this year and I think you're about running at $200 million. And what are your expectations? Are you going to still keep up with that $400 million number or given what you're seeing in the market are you going to tap the brakes a little bit? John McPherson : I think Bob, we'll keep up with that number. But let me give you a couple of important reminders. Our core CapEx spending as a portion of that $400 million is about $ 275 million. So think about that as core operating maintenance capital. And then there's another $125 million in that number that's essentially growth capital. Non-M&A growth capital. So our CapEx outlook both now and through the balance of the recovery remains unchanged. We have not seen anything in the marketplace conditions and I'd underscore this that would cause us to put brakes on our own capital spending or on our pursuit of M&A. Again, our view on the business and its outlook if anything is probably strengthening, so nothing from a external market condition point of view that would cause us to adjust our capital spending. Bob Wetenhall : Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you. And one question on profitability. Your gross margin expansion was pretty tremendous at 500 basis points and that came in ahead of what we were anticipating and I wanted to understand what were the drivers of that? Was it more about getting favorable pricing as obviously a huge tailwind for that, but how much was also operating leverage and what kind of relief did you get from lower costs for diesel fuel? John McPherson : Yes, Bob, obviously we had healthy price in the quarter and that will continue. But I thought our folks did a really nice job with their operating costs particularly with a little bit lower volumes and they continue to not only leverage the volume, but also just improve on the key operating efficiencies and disciplines that drive the profitability of the business. So it was a combination of the two. To answer your question on diesel, total diesel was an impact of about $7 million. Bob Wetenhall : Got it. Okay. And just one final. I think you guys doubled your spend on share buybacks for the quarter from $23 million in the first quarter to $46 million. Any thoughts as you look out into the back half of the year about share buyback activity and what's left under the authorization? Thanks and good luck. John McPherson : Thanks, Bob. I think we have over 2 million shares left on the authorization. So I think that it's not a question of authorization. Our path on share repurchase I would call unchanged as we've said before, we'll continue to return excess cash to shareholders at this point in the cycle primarily through share repurchase, we'll remain opportunistic in doing so as opposed to give any particular commitment to a certain level of repurchase activity in advance. But again, our basic approach to capital allocation remains unchanged and as such, we may continue to repurchase shares as another way to return capital to shareholders. Operator : We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms : Hi, good morning. Tom Hill : Good morning, Trey. Trey Grooms : Couple of questions on kind of getting back to the lull in the large projects that you guys mentioned. I know you touched on some of the public stuff, but you also mentioned that there was some private projects there. And then also, May being the weaker month in the quarter, I'm guessing weather played a big role there that you highlighted. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is that the timing of when these projects that were either pushed to the right or what have you when those could come through. I mean, is that a third quarter event or fourth quarter would they be more like into 2017? How do we think about the timing? Tom Hill : Well, I think it will be all over the place obviously with large projects. Let me give you kind of a little bit of a view on some large projects and put a little flavor on that. So if you look at Virginia for example, I mentioned Northern Virginia, the Route 66 projects will be probably 6 million tons, I85 and that job actually will go in 2017, I85 in Southern Virginia is over 800,000 tons, but you'll see some of that in 2016, but a lot has got pushed into 2017. And in North Carolina, the I85 widening it's probably 1.2 million tons and those will see a little bit of that in 2016, but a -- majority of it in 2017 and the Northwest Corridor in Atlanta is 1.5 million and that's the widening of I75 and it's a 1.5 million tons and that will probably do a little more, we will probably get 700,000, 600,000 tons in 2016. So it will be all over the place. And again, as John said earlier, it's going to be a matter of timing. The good news is the contractors and our customers want to get the work done, they are going to press to get it done because they have visibility and know what's coming in 2017, and so they've got to get this off their books so they can free their crews up and go on to other projects. So the desires there, it's just a matter of, will they have the crews in the fourth quarter, will the weather allow them to do it. Trey Grooms : Right. So kind of with that, I'm just trying to get a feel for how we should be thinking about the quarterly cadence kind of looking into the back half. Third Quarter or Q3 obviously faces a tougher comp, but it's also generally a seasonally stronger quarter for you guys and then with kind of the back drop of weather and how things have moved around, anything unique about the seasonal cadence or your expectation there as we look in the back half? Tom Hill : I don't think there's anything unique about it except for very similar to last year. I would underscore what I just said about the contracts and desire to get it done. They are pressed even more in 2016 than they were in 2015 to get this work done because there's so much work coming for 2017. You'll see both on the commercial side and highway side, so desires there and the third quarter is always healthy, but depending on weather the fourth quarter could be great too. We'll decide to just wait and see. Trey Grooms : Got it. And then, last one for me and John, I mean, you guys in the whole team impressive incrementals and gross profit per ton. And I think last quarter you said that you expect to see incrementals for this year a little higher than the longer term kind of 60% target. And with half the year behind us now and the current cost environment, can you update us on your thoughts there? John McPherson : Sure, Terry. I think we still say 60% is our long-term as in through the entire recovery and expansion cycle number but that's a multi-year view. We've obviously been doing better than that of late, sometimes substantially better. I think for the balance of the year, I'm not sure we see a much different trajectory than we've been on so far this year in terms of incrementals. Some of that in a very short period of time if you took an individual month or maybe an individual quarter can be influenced by the mix of price and volume in our growth. But overall, our team has continued to do a great job. Again, I come back to something Tom said in his remarks. The work is there. The demand is there. Importantly Terry to your question, the profitability is there, core profitability in our business maybe running a little ahead of our plan. And so we come down to for 2016 is really a question of timing of the shipments and how much gets done this year versus next. But again, the work is there, the demand is there and importantly the profitability is there and we see that trend continuing. Trey Grooms : Great. That's it for me. Thanks a lot. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Garik Shmois, Longbow Research. Garik Shmois : Hi, thank you. First question is, just you talked about the weakness in Illinois sounds like there's a fundamental change perhaps when you think about that market. Could you just speak to perhaps the importance of that market strategically. And then just broadly what you're seeing and what your appetite is for either acquisitions or divestments at this point in the cycle? Tom Hill : First of all, as John said, you've got a lot of well known funding and budget issues, although they did reaffirm the highway spending in Illinois on one hand the positive and they also cut the toll way spending in half, which will cost us about $700 million in the State for next year. I think the positive side of that is you're still seeing growth on the private side. And as John said, this is a very good business for us and we have a very, very strong market position and our teams up there have done a great job of improving their unit margins even with some falling volume. Some of that volume Garik is, we were at two very large jobs one at O'Hare and one the toll way that we were working on last year and we're starting to wind down so some of that's just again timing of projects. But overall, it's a strong market for us and an important market and one that I think our folks have done a nice job improving. Garik Shmois : Okay. And could you touch on just second part of the question with respect to M&A at this point in the cycle, what are you seeing out there as far as valuations are concerned, what's your appetite for additional deals and how do you balance that relative to your capital structure? Tom Hill : They're still out there. We've got a number of them as John said in his comments that we're working on, when they will close is always, each one separate, each one is timing. But you always have to be disciplined about what you're buying and what you are paying and what the unique synergies that we have for Vulcan are and how do we leverage those so it's there. We're hot on that trail and we've got a number of them in the pipeline. John McPherson : And only thing we would add to your question, which I think we also addressed in our comments is, if anything we're pushing harder on opportunities particularly those that fit us strategically. We're going to stay disciplined on valuations obviously but we've worked hard to be in a position where we now have the financial capacity to really do good deals where they exist, to make the right ongoing capital investments in our business and to return some capital to shareholders so we can balance all those things and we will certainly have the financial flexibility to pursue M&A of that growth. All that said we're going to stay really disciplined about it. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks just want to shift as my follow-up question to the coastal markets in Texas clearly weather impacted demand in May in particular. Are you seeing anything fundamentally changing or decelerating along the coast? If so, how does that impact the productivity out of your Cancun quarry, and then, also would there be anything for us to think about over the maybe in the medium term if there is deceleration in the coastal markets in Texas around price mix given it was a headwind in the quarter? Tom Hall : I think that the story as you said in Texas was the coastal piece of it. Weather was a big impact. Let's face it coastal Texas was under water for more than a month and so that impacted. We also had as John says timing of large projects we have the grand parkway and some big energy projects we are working on last year. We've worked some of that work off, there's still some in the pipeline, golden pass, Beaumont LNG, so you'll see that come -- some of those tons come back next year. It's hard to tell what's going on in res and non-res with the weather pattern we had in the second quarter, probably some softening in Houston. But behind that, you've got huge increases in highway spending that we've seen some of that in 2015 and 2016 but you're going to see more of that in 2017 and 2018 and 2019. And nothing Garik was already summed up, the visibility is not great because the weather is so bad, in a quarter where you have volumes drop to 30% in one market, it's hard to get a lot of visibility with that kind of drop. But as you look at it, you've got strengthening public spending that should offset potentially some weakening private spending. We haven't seen that weakening elsewhere in Texas yet by the way. The little bit we've seen around Houston we've not seen spread to the rest of Texas. And finally your question about price impact or impact on logistics out of our quarry in Mexico, I don't think anything I'd call material anyway-- Tom Hall : Well, I think you have to remember the quarter in Mexico we shipped to some 17-18 port facilities all the way around from Brownsville all the way around to Jacksonville, Florida. So where you might have some temporary softening and timing of projects on the coast of Texas, you've got the Southeastern Florida and those markets picking up substantially. So there's a lot of flexibility in that overall business. And we think we're fine with it. John McPherson : And again on pricing, which is just really a mixed issue not a fundamental underlying price issue. I don't think we would expect these kind of declines we saw in the second quarter and future quarters. So I don't see anything that I would try and model in on pricing. Garik Shmois : Okay. Makes sense. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll go next to Timna Tanners, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning guys. Tom Hall : Good morning. Timna Tanners : So I was curious about your comment on the election year having a numbing effect or people whatever you said maybe on the local side. And just wanted to get a sense of, if you could characterize the political sentiment you're getting from you're canvassing of Washington in light of kind of the positive spirit of dialogue lately on public infrastructure spending. Tom Hall : I think the good news there is everybody is talking about it. Both Presidential candidates, who got a number of people in Washington concerned about the countries infrastructure. They all know it's an issue. And they also understand that it is stimulus if we do it correctly. So like I said we have a five year bill, but we still have degraded highway system and that bill is not going to improve that grade. So it is an issue and now what's going to happen we don't know, we know what's going to happen with the election, but it is an important issue in one that people are putting out there in front of everyone. John McPherson : And Timna, it's John because I may have made the comments just to add to that. And my comments weren't reflective on the nature of the dialogue around future infrastructure spending which we actually as Tom said is quite positive at a federal level, State level and local level across many of our geographies. It's more just a negative tone and some degree of uncertainty that would seem to affect private investment levels. And you'll know more about this than us but you may have seen some of that in second quarter GDP data. And we probably have some customers who on balance just given negative tone out there particularly on the private side are a little more reluctant than they would be in a different time to add their own additional capacity to make their own big capital investments whether that's a new equipment or land for development or larger staffs. So I wouldn't want to make it too big a deal. What's interesting though is, just this disconnect between the tone you're going to hear in the middle of an election cycle which is really negative and what we see in our own business which frankly is pretty positive but nothing longer term, the dialogue around higher levels of public infrastructure spending particularly on road infrastructure and other infrastructure we are pretty excited about. Timna Tanners : Okay. And then to wrap up with a couple other thematic questions. So are you seeing much for small on labor constraints that we've been hearing about on construction? Is that an issue at all for you? Second of all, how good is your visibility relative to normal levels in light of that kind of more cautious sentiment? Tom Hall : I think that the first of all the labor issue, yes, we're seeing shortages with our customers whether it's ready mix truck drivers or finishers or carpenters on residential. So there are constraints -- there are labor constraints out there. And it is a bottleneck for our customers and therefore for us. I think they are working through it. We've been on this theme for now about a year and that's actually good news because it means it's growing and it's growing faster than they can fill the ranks and the work isn't going to go anywhere it's a matter of getting enough timing. John McPherson : And on your question about normal, it wouldn't change our view of normal, but as we've discussed many times before, these bottlenecks whether they are labor or others that some of our customers face, they probably do constrain on the margin, the rate of growth or the rate of recovery keeping us for now in the 7%, 8%, 9% rate as opposed to something that the underlying demand would justify being higher. Flip side is that it can create a generally positive pricing climate but it may make for a longer recovery at a slightly slower rate like that 7%, 8%, 9% rate as opposed to something that would get up into the sustained double digits for a very long period of time. Timna Tanners : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Operator : We'll go next to Stanley Elliott, Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Hi, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. A quick question on the outlook for costs -- the unit costs on the aggregate side. Obviously, the incrementals are going to be strong this year. Diesel has been a bit of a tailwind. How much longer can diesel realistically, be a tailwind for you guys and then maybe speak to some of the investments that you're making either on the sales side or on the production side to help us keep these incrementals as strong as they are or at least tracking above your historical average. Tom Hall : As you look out towards the second half of the year and the price of diesel last year versus the price of diesel this year is probably not going to be a big cost advantage going forward. I think that -- as I said earlier, I think our folks are doing a really good job of concentrating on our own operating efficiencies that we can control. Volumes are coming back, can help that. So I feel pretty good about our cost and our ability to take incremental revenues to the bottom line. As far as capital projects, they are all over the place. Some is as simple as replacement of mobile equipment, screens and crushers, usually when you do plant capitalist a combination of both replacement and process improvement to get more throughput or reduce down time, which helps on your cost obviously other than just like-for-like replacement. On the growth side, we've got a number of facilities who are working on our distribution network both rail and blue water that were all of them are different stages of completion and then we've got a number of greenfield projects that we're working on at different stages in completion. John McPherson : Only additional color I would add is while we may not have the same tailwinds from diesel moving forward we should be beginning to work out of a period where we had elevator repair maintenance costs kind of earlier in the recovery. So we're hopeful those trends will offset each other a little bit some more work to do there. And just a reminder we've got a lot of fixed costs yet to leverage in this recovery. So as Tom said we're pretty proud of what our teams did and particularly as an example in a quarter without much volume growth and still with very uneven production schedules due to weather challenges to control your costs in a quarter like the one we just finished, is a good sign of the right disciplines, so we have a pretty positive outlook about our margin performance looking forward. Stanley Elliott : Absolutely I agree. And just a reminder, when do the new ships come on line? Is there anyway to talk about either improved efficiency or cost savings or anything along those lines around the ten new vessels? Tom Hall : Yes. They will come on line at different stages next year. And they will both be more efficient both particularly in fuel also they have less draft and more tonnage capacity. So we'll see improvements cost wise with those ships as they come on line and we'll be excited to get those. John McPherson : Probably a little early to talk about it specifically though. That may be something more a 2017 item probably a little too early to talk about it specifically but they are good investments. Stanley Elliott : That sounds fair. And then, lastly on the M&A side, obviously, plenty of flexibility within the capital structure, are you thinking more on the bolt-on side or there new markets you'd be interested in entering, how should we think about that from a footprint perspective? Tom Hall : Both, primarily bolt-on. I mean those are some of our best returns and it proves out the efficiencies in the overall franchise, but and it's healthy, so and then as far as new markets we did that 18 months ago in New Mexico and where we have a path to number one or number two position, we'll look at new places and if not we probably won't. Stanley Elliott : Is it still fair to say mostly aggregate focused and potentially some downstream assets but certainly not the primary focus? Tom Hall : You said it well. We like aggregates. Stanley Elliott : Perfect guys. Thanks very much and best of luck. Tom Hall : Thank you. John McPherson : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Norfleet, Alembic Global Advisors. Nick Chen : Hi. This is Nick Chen for Rob. Thanks for taking our question this afternoon. You guys touched on a little bit earlier just discussing California, but I was hoping you could opine a bit on just some of the State level funding bills that you guys are tracking and sort of where you expect them to have the biggest impact going forward? Tom Hall : Sure. I talked about California. They were going to lose a little bit of funding but there are a number of three bills in particular that would add between $3 billion and $7 billion. And they have to address their roads, and then, the local impact, which is in total if they all pass would be $2 billion a year. So Texas is one of the fastest growing highway markets. We saw a 30 in our markets in Texas in just the highway lengths alone. In 2016, we'll see an improvement of over 30%, state is a whole improvement of over 20% and a lot of that will really actually go in 2017. And then you'll have improved funding again in both 2017 and 2018. That will go up about 15% or 20% in 2017, and then, there's another over $2 billion that comes on to Texas in 2018. Georgia basically doubled their highway funding that passed a year ago and we'll see a little bit of that in 2016 as I said earlier majority will come in 2017 and 2018. North Carolina has improved their funding as has Florida, as has South Carolina, as has Virginia. There are bills being discussed in Alabama and probably won't be addressed until 2017. I'd tell you a similar story in Tennessee where it needs to be addressed, they have not, it won't happen in 2016, hopefully will happen in 2017. So as I said, a lot of our states have marked improvement in funding and the vast majority of that except for Texas will flow through in 2017 and 2018. So we're really looking forward to this. And this was a real bright part of our future. Nick Chen : That's really helpful. Thanks so much. Tom Hall : You bet. Operator : We'll go to Brent Thielman, D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : Thanks. Good morning. Tom Hall : Good morning. Brent Thielman : Is there a way to think about the moving pieces of these various issues in May in terms of the impact you reported average price for the quarter? Tom Hall : I think the average price as I said earlier was healthy in spite of some geographic and product mix issue, probably one of the bigger impacts in the quarter was on that was -- just the mix issue was coastal Texas as John said volumes were down 30%. It's a very -- it has healthy pricing and so that had a little bit of an impact. But overall, the environment for pricing across our footprint remains healthy, it's strong, throughout the entire construction segment pricing is moving up and that's driven by demand increases and is also driven by the visibility of what everybody sees coming in 2017 and 2018. JohnMcPherson: Just giving little more color if it helps, I think our average selling prices, if you take all of the moving pieces and adjust as best you can on a like-for-like basis probably would have been $0.03 or $0.04 higher than what we reported. Again, a lot of that is having a big decline in coastal Texas. Now at the same time that's accounting for some of our South Eastern markets which have good pricing too growing pretty quickly. So on a total like-for-like basis, when you look at geographic issues and the product mix issues, our rate of price growth year-over-year would have been a little closer to eight than what we reported. But I wouldn't let any of that distract you from what Tom said which is the core pricing outlook and climate remains positive given where we are in the recovery. And I'd also just remind you prices went up pretty healthy in those very same markets that were volume challenged, so Virginia, Illinois, California, Texas those are all markets that have had good pricing and margin improvement not just in this quarter but for the last few quarters. Brent Thielman : Okay. That's helpful. And then you've talked about the variability and timing of all of these large projects in terms of volumes. When we think about your outlook for potential volume for the year and kind of the company overall, is it more heavily impacted by larger projects than what we would typically see? Tom Hall : No. I don't think it's more. I think this is just a piece of it. So part of it is going to be the large projects. As we said earlier part of it just across the entire market segments is going to be, can the contractors and can our customers get the work done in the time that they have. So we talked about labor shortages, you have those and those are an issue so it's about both timing of large projects, our customers ability to get work out. And then how many days do we have of construction in the fourth quarter. All that will go together to really see how the year turns out. But I'll remind you this is exactly what we saw in 2015. Brent Thielman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jim Margard, Rainier Investment Management. Jim Margard : Hi. Thank you. Could you comment a little bit more on the mix as you mentioned, the Texas coastal situation was impactful and presumably that mix will turn more favorable so simply by virtue of that. But could you elaborate a little bit more going into the future and also were there any other mix issues other than coastal Texas and as you go more into your bigger infrastructure build, in 2017 and 2018 what are the implications for the mix in that? Tom Hall : Well, first of all, in the quarter, pricing was a combination of the mix impact was both geographic which was Texas and then mix. So we had some large base work in the southeast and we also had large shot rock projects in Florida. And while they may have an impact on price it has a overall positive impact on profitability because you've got to sell those mix of products and some of them are cheaper to make. And so the price of the margins while the price maybe lower the margin is very healthy and you need to sell the full product line to maximize profitability in our operations. On your question about highway construction and coming highway construction, that really plays into our hand in that -- it is a really healthy mix of what our plants produce. It has a combination of base and fines because it's new construction and it has asphalt rock, it has concrete rock, so it gives the full flavor of everything we produce and just pushes the overall profitability up. John McPherson : And when you think about it geographically, we really like the -- particularly -- well, we like it now, we like it longer term, the breadth and positioning of our particular geographic mix. These trends we're seeing and where we see the growth and the nature of the increased public spending we commented on earlier. If anything these should give us tailwinds from a geographic mix point of view. We're well positioned against where the growth is coming. Tom Hall : Over and beyond that on aggregates it also fits into our hand with our asphalt business. So we have very strong positions in a number of states with asphalt, which is a lot more public driven, so all of the spending on highways will help that business. Jim Margard : Great. Thank you. Tom Hall : You're welcome. Operator : At this time, we'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Tom Hill for closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials and we look forward to talking to you this quarter and over the balance of the year. And I would like to thank our employees for all of their hard work and the things they do to make this company great. Thanks. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Laura and I will be your conference coordinator today. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. Additionally, today's call is being recorded. And now I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide, we will focus on the highlights. We hope this approach will provide more time to respond to your questions. With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our earnings release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation. Now I'd like to turn the call over Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you, Mark. Thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll keep our remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Aggregates Day event in Atlanta. Looking at the third quarter and our recent performance, four main points stand out. First, we obviously saw shipments declined in the third quarter. However, to my second point, we see it as localized, not cyclical. Third, our profitability continues to grow. And fourth, our prospects for sustained growth remain very exciting. Let me address each in just a little more detail. First, we obviously have seen a drop in year-over-year shipments. This is due in part to a period of relative weakness and new construction starts across much of our footprint. It's also due to weather and other location-specific factors, impacting our business in California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois. Third quarter year-over-year shipments in these four states were down 15% collectively. Now in stark contrast, our other markets experienced combined year-over-year shipment growth of 6%, and in fact, several markets saw strong double-digit growth to the order of 12% to 21%. Second and importantly, we continue to view these volume headwinds as temporary or a transitional lull in a multiyear recovery that is still intact and sound and actually with a long way to run. To this point, the variation in results across our footprint reveals volume challenges that are clearly localized rather than cyclical. Notably, our daily aggregate shipment rate increased from August to September and from September to October with October exceeding the prior year period by about 3%. In addition, according to Dodge reports, trailing 12-month construction starts showed sequential improvements in both August and September, picking up from a noticeable slowdown in March that lingered all the way through July. In short, the fundamental foundational drivers of a multiyear recovery remain firmly in place. To point number three. Our core profit engine remains very powerful. We're on track to deliver $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year, and this is despite volumes that are below our original expectations. In our aggregates segment, third quarter freight-adjusted selling prices were 7% ahead of third quarter 2015, and gross profit per ton rose 9%. For the 12 months ended in September, gross profit per ton has increased 25%. The flow through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue into incremental gross profit has exceeded 80%. Also for the 12 months ended September, the total business delivered net earnings of $371 million and $981 million of adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 27%. This is an improvement of 430 basis points over the prior year. Fourth and finally, we remain excited about our long range growth prospects. We are well on track to achieve our profitability goals. And near-term, we like the volume, pricing and profitability momentum we see for 2017. We also like the very robust pipeline of projects that we see building for 2018 and 2019. Now John will share a few thoughts regarding our current momentum and outlook in a minute, but first I'll offer a bit more insight into how our business has been performing across our footprint. As we discussed during our Aggregates Day in Atlanta, the recent demand climate has made it a little hard to distinguish the signal from the noise. For example, there has been clear accelerating growth in the longer-term project pipeline. The impact of the federal highway bill, the FAST Act, and higher state level funding are beginning to show up in the mix. At the same time, there has been a softening in the rate at which this water behind the dam has been released in the form of construction starts. There was also a lull in state highway spending during the first half of the year and this was as states work their way through the remainder of a fiscal year that did not include new FAST Act points (07:06). Notably, this has now started to turn in a positive direction. The latest OTMA (07:15) report on highway contract awards shows them increasing by 30% in September. And this is the second consecutive month of growth following weak contract award activity during the first half of the year. Looking closely, this isn't too surprising as many states have entered a new fiscal year with the FAST Act money flowing into their pipelines and a backlog of projects ready to go. During the slowdown period early this year, a number of markets saw adverse weather conditions, shortages in skilled labor and other factors that have constrained the rate at which existing construction projects could be completed. A number of our customers have found it difficult to catch up in the near-term on work deferred due to bad weather earlier in the year. Generally speaking, our operations across the Southeast and mid-Atlantic states continue to post solid gains in volumes despite these challenges. Florida, Georgia and North Carolina enjoyed robust double-digit volume growth to the tune of 12% to 21%, and this was accompanied by strong pricing and unit margin performance. Now Virginia on the other hand is an example of a market where we're seeing good pricing momentum, although volume momentum hasn't picked up yet. Turning to Texas and California. Shipment levels in these states remain challenged in the third quarter. This was below the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Shipments in Texas were down 21% in the quarter. This was driven in part by Coastal Texas shipments which were down 27%. All of Texas was impacted by bad weather throughout the quarter, most notably in August. Business in North and South Texas fell off accordingly from what would otherwise have been a much stronger performance in those areas. Houston and the Coast, however, in addition to the well-known downturn in the oil and gas industry and extensive flooding also experienced a delay in TxDOT work. So, when we talk about Texas and volume declines, it is, in fact, largely isolated to the coastal area of the state, separating out statewide weather impacts. But despite a transitory period of volume headwinds, there is ongoing pricing momentum in Texas and it simply highlights the underlying confidence and continued growth in the Lone Star State. At the same time, our core profitability, which has also been strong, keeps improving. The bottom line is that, overall, we expect continued recovery in Texas market. In California, shipments were down 17% from last year's quarter. We continue to see a slowdown in large project work in public and private sectors. This is work we are well positioned to serve. Caltrans also continued to grapple with highway funding related to diminished excise taxes. This created a bigger slowdown in project work than anticipated. We have reason to believe that political leaders will ultimately reach agreement on new state funding measures for California roads, which are rated the worst in the U.S. Putting it all together, we expect to see a return in 2017 to a pattern of recovery and growth in California. Our sales force is aligned to take advantage of these growth opportunities. Large projects are getting back on track. The pipeline of major projects continues to get bigger and bigger. Construction starts are back on the upswing and there will ultimately be improvements in state funding for roads along with local highway improvement initiatives. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of improvement. Highway contract awards in California were up 98% in September as these new FAST Act funds are starting to flow into the system. Underlying these facts are fundamental strengths. In our California business as well as Texas, our core profitability continues to improve. And in California, as in Texas, despite the lull in shipments, pricing has remained strong, in the high single-digits, underscoring the basic confidence in the trajectory of California markets. Across our company, our focus on core profit improvements, the little things that make us better every day, is keeping us on track towards our longer-term goals and you see it in our results. Now I'll hand it over to John for some brief additional comments regarding our outlook for 2016 and the momentum we see heading into 2017. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everybody. I'd like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in Atlanta. First, and as Tom noted, we continue to project $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2016. And due to continued gains in unit profitability and overall margins, we think we can reach the low end of our beginning-of-year guidance range despite shipments falling well below our original forecast. Now, to put this outlook into some context, let's take a look at results and trends, particularly with respect to our improved profitability over the trailing 12 months. As you heard Tom say and as you've seen in our release, during that period, we generated net earnings of $371 million and adjusted EBITDA of $981 million. But behind that, it's important to note that our average freight-adjusted selling prices in our aggregates segment have increased 8% over that time. Our average gross profit per ton has increased 25% over that time, and our overall gross profit as a percent of freight-adjusted revenue for the company has risen from 34% to 39%. As we consistently call out, fourth quarter results can be impacted significantly by weather and the effective length of the construction season and our strong results from Q4 of 2015 present tough comparisons. But our improved core profitability should be sufficient to allow us to reach our stated goals for 2016 if recent shipment momentum holds up through the quarter. Now turning to 2017. I'll begin by reiterating that it remains too early for us to give specific or firm guidance. We're primarily focused on finishing the current year strong and we're just at the beginning of our internal planning cycle for next year. But from what we can see today, from the data we see today, we expect continued volume recovery in 2017 along with further improvements in pricing and overall margins. In other words, continued progress on track with the longer range goals we've outlined previously. With respect to volumes, and again, we're not yet in a position to share specific numbers, we currently expect growth in each of our primary end use segments next year, residential, private non-res, highways and other public infrastructure. And we also expect to see broad-based growth across our geographic footprint and growth in substantially all of our key market areas. We've noted that construction start data points have recently turned back up after several months of softening. And highway contract awards in our key states have also turned up recently. And on top of that, longer-term project pipelines continue to strengthen from our already strong levels. But the relative start weakness we've experienced earlier this year combined with strong first quarter 2016 comparisons suggest that 2017's volume growth on a year-over-year basis could be back half loaded. We expect the pricing climate to remain positive and constructive for 2017. The strength of longer-term project pipelines and significant increases in dedicated public transportation funding reinforce confidence in a sustained recovery. And materials producers and others in the construction supply chain remain focused on earning adequate returns on capital. Competition remains intense, but overall and generally speaking, we're battling over value and not just volume. Given these dynamics, we'd expect our free cash flow profile and overall financial condition to strengthen further next year. We should have the financial capacity and the flexibility needed to support reinvestment in our franchise, growth including but not limited to M&A, as well as additional returns of capital to shareholders. Tom, back over to you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, John. We're pleased with the continued strong earnings growth and margin expansion we saw in the third quarter despite lower shipment levels. The drivers of recovery in shipments remain very much in place. Our core profitability continues to improve and our fundamental outlook for the future of the business remains unchanged. Given that positive outlook, I can assure you that we will invest in our business accordingly. We will keep investing internally. For example, we will plow about $125 million into internal growth projects this year. These projects will help us serve our customers better, increase efficiencies and add to the bottom line. They include five new rail yards, three in Texas, one in Charleston, South Carolina, and another one in Savannah, Georgia along with six greenfield sites that's new quarries, that we're developing in growth markets across the country. At the same time, we will continue to aggressively pursue bolt-on acquisitions in key markets as well as other strategic acquisitions, all of which will further strengthen our leading position in the industry. I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their commitment to improving every day, to working safely, to finishing this year strong and to delivering another year of even stronger results. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We'll take our first question from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. Really just want to focus on certain geographies and I know that you gave some color in your prepared comments, I just want to dig a little bit deeper. First on California, a lot of their budget with Caltrans has been tied to gas prices. Do we see gas prices move up? How has that impacted your conversations with Caltrans regarding the budget? Also, when you look at the volume softness in that state, how much of it was large project delays versus the budget related issues which seem to be(19:52) apparently tied together, or any other relevant factor that we should take into consideration? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Kathryn. I think \u2013 let me just kind of comment on California overall. I think we feel optimistic about demand in California. We see sustained strength in residential and kind of smaller private work. And the headwinds that we faced this year shouldn't repeat next year. If you look at the pipeline data, start data and listen to our customers, we feel better about California even though we haven't seen the shipments come back yet. And we feel good about the public funding situation in California. The elements are in place for this to come together for state funding. You got to remember that California still has the worst roads in the country even with a little bit of increase in the gas taxes from (20:43) price. We'll start to see the FAST Act start kicking in and then we saw a August redistribution of federal funds at just under $ 0.25 billion to California. And then you've got, as you know, you've got the local initiatives that are on the ballot for next week that if they all pass would total about $2.5 billion annually. So, for us in California, as we say, it's not if, it's really about pace and probably the pace of large projects. So I think we're feeling pretty good about 2017 and the longer-term outlook is pretty bright for California. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Thank you. And then on Illinois, that state has been a little tougher when you think about just kind of the state from \u2013 not only from the public side but also from a private sector spending. How should we think about... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, I think... Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : ...Illinois and as we go forward? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think that's a real contrast to California where we feel like California's fundamentals are really good and coming back very strong. Illinois is a weak spot for us and it's really about public funding. The private side is actually not too bad in Illinois, but the public side is just going to be tough for us. I would say this much. Even with volumes down, I'm proud of our team in Illinois. They have \u2013 their profitability is up and facing some pretty good headwinds. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And Kathryn, just to add a little bit of color on those two states, I think it's instructive to contrast Illinois and California a little bit. Illinois, for us, the business is doing quite well as Tom said. There's actually some green shoots in their funding, some toll road funding, some other funding that's not as dependent on the overall public sources. As you probably know, there are some efforts to, if you will, protect transportation funding from other needs in the state. But Illinois is the one place we called out where we just don't see the path to long-term growth that we see in the rest of our footprint. If we contrast that with California which, yes, is going through a little bit of a lull right now, particularly on some large public funding, even the outlook next year for California is quite bright and we see growth in California in 2017 and beyond. And so those are very different situations in our view. One which is doing well and profitable but doesn't right now have the long-term growth visibility. California is quite different. Yes, as you know quite well, Caltrans is challenged with some of their funding this year. Yes, that impacts us disproportionately because of our large asphalt presence and the customers we really lined up to serve well. But we don't expect to see anything like the same headwinds next year that we've seen this year in California. And I'd also just remind you, just to give you a sense of that visibility and how it plays out in the marketplace, our pricing in California is up nearly double-digits. So very different situation between those two states. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Thanks. That was a good segue for my next question just for the consolidated aggregate pricing in the quarter. How much was product mix and/or geographic mix impacting total average price of the quarter? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: There was an impact from geographic mix, probably just under 1%, negative impact. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And Kathryn, a lot of that is \u2013 think of how much our business in a place like Coastal Texas was down and that's one of our higher priced markets, and that \u2013 even that by itself had a significant impact on total pricing for the business. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. Perfect. And then finally, just more broadly speaking, would love to get your thoughts or color on are you starting to see FAST Act dollars flow through these states and how much was that a contributor to strength in the markets that did have solid growth? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think that you're starting to see FAST Act dollars flow through in lettings. I don't think they've flown through to shipments yet. And I think you'll start to see that in the first, second quarter, probably second quarter of 2017. But so we're backlogging jobs right now that are in the letting. The lettings are picking up because of FAST Act spending, but I don't think we've seen much of that get into shipments yet. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, not into shipments. But we saw \u2013 we began to see a real uptick as several state DOTs turned into their new fiscal year. And we are seeing some of that FAST Act money, as Tom noted, begin to be more aggressively allocated, including a reallocation of funds to California that happened just recently. So the money is getting put to use, but we really haven't seen it impact our actual aggregate shipments very much yet at all. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. Great. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Provides visibility for pricing, so it's probably a positive on pricing but not a big impact yet on shipments. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Next we'll turn to Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Morning, Trey. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: I guess quick question on one of the comments you had in the prepared remarks about October. I think you mentioned that it was trending up kind of around 3%. First, was that pretty broad-based across your enterprise? Or was it more geographically isolated to certain markets driving that improvement? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: It was pretty broad-based. We're still facing some challenges as we said in California, but other than that and a little bit of weather on the East Coast, it was broad-based. And I think that what you're seeing there is some of the projects starting to come through, both res and non-res, and that'll pick up as we move into 2017. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Trey, just for a little more color for you all \u2013 and as Tom says, obviously very broad-based. But just to clarify a little bit further, it has bounced back in Texas. It has not, as Tom said, bounced back yet in California. Although as we just discussed, we see a lot of positive signs for next year in California. If you took California out or if California were flat, that 3% up number would be up 5% to 6%. I'm just trying to give you a feel for how broad-based in relative strength ex-California. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: So California's still a little bit soft in October for us. Again, we see a lot of positive signs, but it's taking a while to flow through. Texas is already rebounding, and you'll get a feel for what the rest of it adds up to. So \u2013 now to be clear, when we say that's daily shipment rate \u2013 again, to give you all a feel, we're shipping a little more than 800,000 tons per shipping day. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And I just want to be clear now so that doesn't get misinterpreted, that's per shipping day. So we had 21 shipping days in October. It's not per calendar day, if you will. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: I got you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: But that'll give you a feel for how much a week longer or week shorter construction season can also have in the fourth quarter for us. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Sure. Okay. That's super helpful. And then I guess with that being said, I don't know if with October behind us now, at the Analyst Day, you said you guys are going to have trouble hitting the 190 million tons of the original guidance that you had. So, with October behind us now, with the third quarter and October behind us I guess, can you help us tighten up that volume range for the year at all as far as kind of how we should be thinking about it if we get, I guess, normal weather in November and December? Anything more granular we can get there? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think as always, as you know, the fourth quarter is about weather and timing and the number of workdays we'll have will be important. Will our customers have enough wherewithal to get the work done in those days? I think that the demand is there. We're seeing the projects coming. Our customers have \u2013 really want to get the work done because they see what's coming in 2017. So the work is there. The desire is there. It's just it's always about timing, and can you get it all done in the number of days you've got left in the year. John? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And, Trey, just to give you a number, given some of those capacity constraints with our customers just getting the work done, we're probably looking at, we'd guess, 182 million tons to 184 million tons, in terms of millions of tons for the year. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And again, keep in mind, there's a lot of variability around that. Again, we're shipping 800,000 tons a day right now. So \u2013 but to answer your question, that's probably what we're looking toward. And at those levels, we think we're still in line with the overall EBITDA guidance we've given. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And my last one is more I guess kind of looking into next year. Directionally, you've talked about volume and price just very broadly and directionally, which I get why you don't want to go into any more detail with that yet. But can you give us, as far as like gross profit per ton and how we should be kind of thinking about that, even if it's just directionally as we look into next year, given the fact that we're expecting volume growth, we're expecting pricing growth, but any geographic mix that could impact and without the tailwind maybe as much on diesel, just how to think about your broad thoughts on gross profit per ton next year. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, I'll start with price. We continue to see a really healthy environment for price, and that's driven not just by demand but really about the visibility that our customers and the market sees with the pipeline that's coming. The majority of our markets have already announced price increases for our fixed plant work. Those will be effective anywhere from January 1 to April 1, and if you just kind of look at the price without putting the markets beside, as we've announced price increases, and I'm just looking at a list of $1, $1.50, $0.75, $1, $0.50, $1.75, $1.25, $1, $1, so healthy price increases. Timing will vary with that. I would tell you, at this point, when we look at it, it's pretty generally accepted in the markets and the markets are healthy with that and all of that's driven by that visibility and confidence in that pipeline that's growing. So that'll give you some kind of idea of what we're seeing on pricing out there. When it comes to cost, I think our folks are doing a really good job managing costs and the operating efficiencies that drive those costs, at the same time, keeping our people safe and volume will only help that. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for the color. Good luck, guys. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Trey, just to \u2013 for everybody, we don't \u2013 there's nothing that we see on the cost side that would throw us kind of off track on recent trend on improving profitability, whether that's flow throughs well above 60%, whether that's our ability to get operating leverage in the system and leverage each step in the P&L, and certainly as we finish off our planning cycle internally, which again, we're just beginning, as you know, we focus quite a bit internally on our profit per ton one market at a time. So I guess we'd be quite surprised if our profit per ton didn't continue to grow a good bit faster than pricing alone would indicate. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Good deal. It's encouraging. Thanks a lot. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Next up is Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My question, you mentioned Illinois, I know you have a Safe Roads Amendment coming out. Assuming it passes, is \u2013 when would one \u2013 I guess when would you start to see money flow through from a project perspective? And then, two, I mean is that only thing or what else do you need to see in the crystal ball to help that piece of the market recover? Because generally speaking, it looks like the other markets in the portfolio are going to do pretty well next year. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, I think what that really does is not new funding or additional funding, it's protecting the funding that's there which is important. Because in Illinois, those funds have been rated in the past, and so it just protects it or safeguards it which is important and a good thing. Illinois, for the public side, they just got to fix some of their funding issues. As John and I said earlier, we don't see that happening for 2017. It's going to take a while. But the private side is still going pretty good in Illinois. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And, Stanley, we don't want to give the impression that Illinois is like in some kind of freefall. It's stabilized at lower level. We just don't see the same kind of longer-term growth fundamentals yet in place that we see in \u2013 really I'm trying to give other exceptions. But across the vast majority of the rest of our footprint, you hear us \u2013 if I contrast it with California again, you hear us talk about things, and you know how this works, population growth, employment growth, state of public revenues, so forth and so on. In a place like California, that story is still very positive. In a place like Illinois, it's less clear. So I don't want to give the impression that it's in some kind of freefall. The business is doing quite well as Tom said. Our team there is doing quite well, but we don't have the same view to one, two, three, four, five-year growth that we have elsewhere. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. No, that's fair. I was just trying to see if there was any sort of inflection point coming up to where it could kind of get a little bit more back on track, but very helpful. And secondly... John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We're hoping the negative inflection point is behind us. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, you know what at some point, I think you're exactly right. But could you help us with \u2013 you mentioned the cost side being favorable. Can you talk a little bit about the enhanced sales initiatives that you mentioned in the press release? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. And again, that's just an area of an investment in the business. As we see long-term growth in the businesses, as we're very focused on providing better service to our customers, to be more valuable to our customers and to get full value for our product, we are continuing to invest in some of our sales support systems, customer support systems, people. Really nothing out of the ordinary, Stanley. Those can be just very important investments to support growth and important to customers' needs. And they tie back to a strategy that's very focused on earning full and fair value for our product. And as such, we need to be providing full service to our customers. So, for a lot of our customers a lot of the time, we are more than just a material supplier, and we want to make sure that as the markets recover, as things get busier, as they face their own constraints, that we're in a position to help them be successful. That's how we're successful. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, to add to that, I think we're seeing what's coming in the next four, five years with growth in all market segments. In order to do that, we need to invest in the sales group so we can add value for our customers and be ahead of that growth curve. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. And last question for me. On a lot of these internal initiatives, how should we think about whether it's in terms of payback or kind of hurdle rates, anything that you would care to share about all the growth investments that you have going on internally? Thanks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, I think this is normal part of our growth. We just don't grow through acquisitions, and this is about protecting and adding value to the franchises that we have. So greenfields are normal projects for us, whether that is distribution of rail or bluewater or new quarries. They take a long time to develop, and you've got to get out ahead of the growth curve. But these are normal projects for us and well above the cost of capital. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: They're actually generally quite attractive, Stanley. As you can imagine, and you know enough about our unit economics, about our margins. We're really doing these kinds of things in markets that we're already in, particularly in a risk-adjusted basis. These are good investments, and we're quite happy to have the financial flexibility to invest in that growth. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Agreed. Best of luck, guys. Thanks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Now we'll move to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Hey, Timna. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Not to hammer home, but on the Q4 commentary, I was a little bit confused because you talk about if the shipment momentum continues then you're on track to meet guidance. But I thought that October was the usually strongest quarter. So do you mean that adjusted for that seasonality if shipment continues? Or what did you mean by that, and if you could just clarify? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think what we're saying there is we're seeing those jobs pick up that we've been talking about and starting to come through. We feel good about the fourth quarter as always. You've got a limited number of days to work through particularly as you get towards the winter months. And so, if not, I don't think it's \u2013 we're seeing the work there, and we're seeing the projects as a matter of constraints for our customers to get it done or number of working days. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. That makes sense. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Timna, unless something odd happened and shortened the construction season by a lot, we'd expect to be, just be clear, on track with our $1 billion of expected adjusted EBITDA for the year. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We're not trying to send any weird signal on that just to be clear. It's the same message as we delivered in Atlanta. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Helpful. In the past, you've talked a little bit about your utilization and talked about raising that utilization and what the incremental costs might be and characterized them. Is that something you can update us on? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, if I understand the question correctly, Timna, this is John, and Tom will chime in of course, but from a plant utilization point of view, if that's your question, we are still \u2013 the vast majority of our facility is well below what we would kind of call sweet spots of operation. So we have a lot of operating leverage in front of us. Probably like others in our business, as we've started the recovery and started to ramp back up production, we've had to work through some periods of higher \u2013 particularly maintenance cost, showed up first in mobile equipment. Now shows up a little bit for us this quarter in our business and takes plant or processing equipment. This is you running things harder and getting them ready for future growth. But to a question that was asked earlier, we should be very well set up to continue to deliver really good operating leverage in what's still largely a fixed cost business for quite a while to come. There will be moments in time where our local operators are wrestling with, and this is obviously a good problem to have, how to add a shift or add a crew and do that most efficiently, most safely, most economically. But if you step back from it and you think about our improved margin structures, you'd think about our incremental flow throughs, the conditions are in place for those numbers to still be quite attractive for quite some time. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, we've got plants that are still running part-time. Even with the volumes that we've seen come back, we're nowhere near optimal operating leverage or efficiencies in these plants. So our operating people are really happy about the volume improvements with the exception of maybe Texas where we're running some plants. We've got lots of run room ahead of us, and I think it will be fun to watch this over the next two or three years. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And while we had a couple of headwinds this quarter, our teams have kept operating costs over the trailing 12 months effectively flat which is a really good accomplishment given the ups and downs in the production side. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So are we talking 60%, 65% still, utilization? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I mean, probably \u2013 every market's different. Demand, different plants when you run them, but yeah, that's where you're talking about. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then final one for me, John. I know I like to harp on this, but you got that high quality problem of a low dividend yield. Is it fair to assume that the next review by the board would be in February and not before then? And are we just going to continue to grow with the company? Or are we going to start to express some of the greater earnings power that you like to talk about? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Well, obviously the board \u2013 let me first say it's a board decision, so I don't want to preview their decision. Obviously reviewed every board meeting. If our past pattern holds true, we'd be announcing something in February. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Again, that's if past pattern holds true. I don't want to prejudge the board's decision. But nothing to our knowledge has changed from our past communications which is, we would expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings throughout the recovery period. And of course, we're very focused long-term on having a sustainable dividend. But really nothing changed, Timna, and February is probably the most likely date. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Again, I don't want to prejudge the board, but that's probably the most likely date. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll move to Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Thank you. Just have a follow-up question on pricing, how we should think about that moving into 2017, provided some color around mix and some of the percent in dollar increase announcements that you have already scheduled for 2017. But if we're to think about the volume growth as potentially back half weighted to next year given the tough comps in the first quarter, given just the timing around state budgets and how funding is going to flow through on the infrastructure side, should we think about the pricing growth opportunity in 2017 as back half weighted as well? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think, as always, what I was giving you in the price increases was fixed plant pricing which will \u2013 timing will all be different, but those will kick in. But you've got to remember, a lot of pricing for our work is bid work where we're quoting one job at a time, and that'll be a campaign. So you'll see gradual price increases in those markets as you are able to raise prices throughout the year. So I don't see anything different in the cadence of pricing as we got coming up versus prior years. The one thing I would tell you is that the environment for pricing and the acceptance of it is very good. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one last question on asphalt, good performance in the quarter despite some challenging volume conditions in California. But if we're thinking about asphalt and the oil prices and potential inflation on the cost side into 2017, how should we start to think about asphalt margins in that backdrop? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think it's one of those where when \u2013 as you see inflation in liquids, you will also see price increases, and I think our folks do a really good job of managing \u2013 creating value for our customers with cost improvements and managing costs along with margin management and material margin management. So my view of that is if you see increases in liquid, could it have a very short-term impact? Yes, as you work off oil work. But overall, the pricing will follow it. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And Garik, we don't, from a financial management point of view, we don't have a lot of long-term exposure or anything like that on the liquids side. So it's more a short-term fluctuation in material margins. As you would well know, Garik, material margins in asphalt are just inherently a little more volatile than they would be, for example, in the aggregate side of the business. But they're also generally pretty attractive through a cycle and you get good returns on the capital through the cycle. So we like that part of our business. Now it's tied in to our aggregates franchise, but we very much like that part of our business. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think the other thing I'd add to that is you're going to see pretty good demand increases in Asphalt, particularly as the public funding starts to flow through. You'll see a lot more highway jobs which will improve the demand, which will \u2013 and our customers in the market see that visibility. They know what's coming. So I think we're pretty optimistic on the profitability with asphalt, despite what happens with liquid, even if that hits us a little bit short-term. Longer-term, I'm pretty pleased with where the asphalt's going. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks so much and good luck. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll next move to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys. This is actually Marshall (46:32) on for Bob this morning. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Marshall (46:34). Unknown Speaker : How're you all doing? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good. Unknown Speaker : You already touched on the dividend. But it looks like you also pretty aggressively bought back some stock in the quarter, and I don't think that any of you all have really sold anything meaningfully. Maybe if you could just tie that to where you see the stock now and the outlook for the business through 2017 and beyond. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Marshall (46:56), this is John. I'll start. Yeah, I don't know if I would use words like aggressive or not, but we bought back 790,000 shares in the quarter. We've bought back a little over 1.4 million shares for the year. As we've said and this is just consistent with the capital allocation priorities we discussed many times, we'll continue to look to return excess cash after a variety of other priorities to shareholders in the form of opportunistic share repurchases. We reserve the right to turn that on, turn that off. We'll report to you kind of after the fact. We're always judging that use of capital relative to M&A and growth investments. And as Tom mentioned, we think we will have some interesting M&A opportunities over time, although they're difficult to predict and we're still active in that marketplace. And we do think of it as both an investment and as a return of capital. So, look, would we be doing it at those levels if we didn't think it was a good investment? No, if that's your question. We think it's a good use of capital. And again, we'll continue to report out on future actions after they occur. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, I think we still see a good outlook both for, as we talked about, the internal investments and growing our business with new quarries and new distribution. But also, the market out there for acquisitions is good. We're working on a number of those. We hope to have some of those to talk about soon, so the growth opportunities in the business are very good. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And, Marshall (48:40), just to \u2013 maybe to answer your question a little more directly. Our fundamental outlook on the business has not changed. In fact, we have a lot of confidence in the profit engine and where that's taken. And a lot of the fundamentals regarding long-term demand recovery, if anything, are more in place now than they were when we had our Investor Day roughly a year-and-a-half, not quite two years ago. So, if you believe those conditions, then in our view, putting some additional capital back into our stock is a good investment. So it's not exclusive of other things we'll do with capital, but we think it's a good use of capital. Operator : Anything further, sir? Unknown Speaker : That's it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back to Mr. Hill for any additional and closing remarks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan Materials and your time this morning. We look forward to talking to you over the next few months. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today's conference. Thank you everyone for your participation.",

Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. My name is Yolanda, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, please begin, sir. Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available on our website supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide on this call, we will focus on the highlights. With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you, Mark. And thank all of you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. You know, it's a very exciting time to be in the Construction Materials business. We have great momentum, and we are as well-positioned as I've ever seen us and we're looking forward to a strong year in 2017 and looking past 2017. Our foundation for sustained growth is as strong as I've ever seen it in my 27 years with the company. Our fourth quarter results didn't match up with the prior year's fourth quarter, which was exceptionally strong in a tough comp. This comparison was affected in a large part because of an earlier end to the construction season in 2016, and also due to continued volume weakness in our California, Illinois and coastal Texas businesses. With the exception of these three areas, fourth quarter aggregate shipments were relatively strong compared to 2015. October-November shipments exceeded the prior year's strong comps, before falling off in the second half of December. This is even with a slowdown in new construction starts during the election cycle with its related uncertainty. Lower shipments volumes and production brought lower fixed cost absorption. At the same time, we made the right investments to support the increasing production we see coming in 2017. These basic and necessary investments to support growth in repair and maintenance and stripping, along with variances in end of the year accounting accruals negatively impacted our unit margins. But stepping back and looking at the full year and our underlying performance trends, what you see is continued compounding improvements in our execution, our service to customers, and in our profitability. We are of the strong view that we are in a long, multi-year recovery where we will continue to build our profitability, our franchise and deliver for our shareholders, our customers and our people. In fact, a longer recovery will enhance profitability as we benefit from further improvements in unit margins, pricing and operating leverage. Here's what we delivered in 2016. 16% growth in adjusted EBITDA, 22% growth in adjusted EBIT, 90% growth in net earnings and 24% growth in cash provided by operations. These numbers reflect our continued success in making meaningful improvements to our underlying profitability, that includes 7% growth in aggregate freight-adjusted average selling prices in 2016, and 14% growth in aggregates gross profit per ton, a record level. We also saw further improvements in asphalt and concrete material margins and a 280 basis point gain in total company gross profit margin, and we achieved important pricing and unit margins across nearly all of our markets. Our 2016 results set us up nicely for 2017 and beyond. Our assets are positioned extremely well to serve the continued recovery in materials demand. The pricing climate remains constructive. Our operating disciplines will enable us to grow margins faster than pricing, and we have the financial strength and flexibility to grow, while at the same time returning capital to shareholders. Combining our strong cash generation and incremental debt capacity, we may have approximately $5 billion to either invest for growth or return to shareholders between now and return to mid-cycle shipment levels. I'll comment more on M&A later in the call. Let me just say now that I like what I see with the acquisitions landscape, and our disciplined pursuit of these opportunities. Now, we faced some volume changes \u2013 challenges in 2016 that I don't expect to repeat this year. You might simply say that we should face easier comparisons later in the year, but let me briefly touch on a few examples. In Texas, our aggregate shipments were down 10% year-over-year given several large project delays and prolonged bad weather. However, shipments in Texas began to strengthen in the fourth quarter. With our North and South Texas areas running ahead of last year's strong pace, we expect volume growth in Texas in 2017. California continue to lag expectations, although we began to see improvements in shipments in some markets, along with continued improvements in pricing. California's failure to address its declining transportation infrastructure in 2016 along with deferred construction on a number of large non-residential projects contributed to the low in our California business. Recent trends suggest those factors will change in 2017. We expect California like Texas to grow in 2017. Illinois also continued to lag, but not at the same pace of decline and pricing was strong. We believe that our Illinois business will hold steady in 2017. The remainder of our business showed strong growth in 2016, on the order of approximately 10% aggregate shipment growth and 6% pricing growth in total. For the most part, we expect that momentum \u2013 the momentum to continue throughout 2017. For example, look at important markets in the Southeast, which enjoyed robust double-digit growth in 2016. South Carolina volume was up 17%, Florida volumes grew by 15%, and Georgia was up 20%. By the way, all of these markets should see double-digit volume gains again in 2017. John will walk us through our expectations for 2017 in a moment. But the bottom line is that we expect another strong year, on track with our longer term, our longer range goals, a year with growth in adjusted EBITDA of approximately 15% to 25%. So we are excited about 2017 and we're excited about the business well beyond 2017. As I look across our markets, the foundation is in place for an extended recovery, with growth in public construction spending just beginning to join the growth we have been seeing in private construction. And while I'm encouraged by the attention we see the Federal Government giving to sustain investment in our nation's infrastructure, our views regarding an extended recovery and demand are grounded in what's happening right now. In the November election, continuing a nationwide secular trend, ballot measures passed in Los Angeles County, San Francisco, Greater Atlanta, and South Carolina added $1.7 billion annually in infrastructure spending in these markets. Other states are poised for action this year. In California, work is progressing quickly in the Senate and Assembly with support from the Governor to increase transportation funding by $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Tennessee and South Carolina also have announced new highway funding proposals that stand a good chance of being enacted this year. So, the momentum continues to build. Voters across the country are demanding that something be done to catch up on decades of underinvestment in public infrastructure. The LA County measure passed with 70% of the vote. That's voters passing a tax increase on themselves, and nationwide, 74% of state and local ballot measures calling for transportation improvements passed during the 2016 election season. Now, certainly more is needed. Federal investment is, in physical infrastructure, as a percentage of GDP is at 0.5%, lower than it's been in decades, and far below levels of investment and \u2013 or in other developed nations. But notwithstanding the need for significant new investment, the foundations for a sustained and extended recovery demand are already in place, and there is no construction materials company in the United States that is better positioned to take advantage of that ongoing recovery than Vulcan. Now I'll hand it off to John to walk you through our 2017 outlook. Then I'll close by addressing our M&A activities and other investments in growth. John? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. As you saw outlined in our release, our performance expectations for 2017 line up with the business's trajectory since the second half of 2013, when the recovery in our part of the economy began, as well as with the longer range goals we've discussed previously. To give you a bit more color, I'll check through some of the expectations underpinning our guidance range of $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion in adjusted EBITDA. And I'll provide some comments regarding the timing in what could be a back-half-loaded year with uneven quarterly comparisons. I'll start with aggregate shipments, where we anticipate volume of between 190 million and 196 million tons or between 5% and 8% growth over 2016. Consistent with the preliminary outlook we shared during our September Investor Meeting in Atlanta, we expect year-over-year shipment growth across all end-use segments, residential, private non-res, public transportation and other public infrastructure and in nearly all of our geographic units. Construction materials demand continues to recover and to recover broadly. Longer-term project pipelines, what has been called the water behind the dam, continues to build. As it relates to our ultimate 2017 shipments, the key question may not be around demand per se, but rather around the pace at which the end-to-end construction sector can move to meet that demand. The recent improvement in construction starts we have seen serves as a positive leading indicator, particularly for the second half of the year. However, we still see constrained construction capacity for certain types of jobs in certain geographies. This uncertainty regarding shipment timing drives our wider range regarding 2017 tonnage. As Tom noted, the overall pricing climate remains positive. For aggregates pricing, we see a gain in freight adjusted average selling prices of between 5% and 7%. Price increases announced for our fixed plant customers have generally been well-received. The momentum in aggregates pricing reflects the confidence market participants have in the sustained recovery, as well as the continued focus by material producers on earning adequate returns on capital. It also reflects a number of construction markets that are effectively supply constrained in the short term, similar to the pricing dynamics that you see in housing, for example. To the extent improved product mix balances, including higher sales rates for fines and base material, negatively impacts reported average selling prices, it should also improve total cash flows. In other words, it would be a good thing. Again, we expect unit margins in our Aggregates segment to expand faster than the rate of pricing growth. For our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments, we expect gross profit growth of approximately 15% in total, driven primarily by volume recovery and improving material margins in concrete. We do not expect the recent growth in SAG expenses to repeat in 2017. The SAG increase in 2016 over 2015 was driven primarily by incentives tied to the company's financial performance and stock price, certain investments in sales and customer service capabilities, as well as elevated legal and other outside service expenses. Operating and maintenance CapEx for 2017 should be approximately $300 million. This figure includes some carryover from 2016, during which time our expenditures were approximately $250 million as compared to our original guidance of $275 million. These figures exclude our internal growth capital investments, such as opening of new rail yards, railcars or our Panamax-class ships. All in all, we expect another year of strong growth in net earnings, EBITDA and cash provided by operations amidst what for now appears to be an extended recovery in demand in materials shipments. We will persist with our focus on continuous compounding improvements in safety, in our operating performance, in our unit margins, and in our capital productivity. We've entered 2017 in a very strong financial position. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged from those discussed previously, and we're in a position to balance reinvestment in our current franchise, M&A and other growth capital investments, and returning capital to shareholders. Now, before handing it back over to Tom, I'd like to offer a few thoughts regarding the timing of revenue and earnings growth throughout the year. We don't give quarterly guidance, as you know, nor do we intend to. However, we do want to remind you that 2017 growth, especially on a quarterly year-over-year comparison basis, could be weighted toward the last three quarters or perhaps even the second half of the year. We expect our shipment momentum to build throughout the year as FAST Act funds begin to drive new construction activity, and as the recent improvement in construction starts begins to impact our business with its typical lag. In addition, and I know this is hardly news to most of you listening, the business faces tougher comparisons in the beginning of the year than it does later in the year. For example, last year's first quarter saw a 17% increase in aggregates volume over the prior year, driven by unusually favorable weather and exceptionally strong large project shipments. And in contrast, the fourth quarter of 2016 was obviously not nearly as strong. Per these examples, we continue to encourage investors to focus on longer-term trends in order to understand the performance and value of the business. And from our perspective, those key trends, multiple years of volume recovery, a positive pricing climate, strong operating leverage, and accelerating growth in free cash flows remain substantially unchanged. Tom, back over to you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, John. At Vulcan, we've moved into 2017 with a great deal of confidence. Our business has come a long way over the last three years, and we intend to maintain that momentum. 2016, a year where we grew EBITDA by 16% on only a 2% gain in aggregates shipments really sets us up for a year that won't see the same volume headwinds. Certainly we are encouraged by the discussions taking place regarding infrastructure investment and corporate tax reform. The country needs these changes. Vulcan's working families need these changes, and yes, Vulcan shareholders also stand to benefit. We have the wind at our back. Our job, internally, as always is to focus on what we can control to serve our customers extraordinarily well, to operate safely and efficiently, and to deliver better and better returns from the capital that we deploy. At Vulcan, we're not satisfied with tailwinds. We're going to raise our internal expectations. We're going to raise our disciplines and our intensity another notch. We're not waiting for National Policy improvements to make our own business better. That's our job, and that's the job we're going to do. If we do that, we'll help our country grow and regain a competitive edge. We'll create jobs and opportunity for our people and we'll be even better positioned to grow for many years to come. Now, on the topic of growth and in particular acquisition-led growth, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on the M&A landscape as we see it today and our approach to it. You likely saw a number of recent bolt-on acquisitions referenced in our press release. This may appear to be a pickup in activity after a period of relative quiet. But I'll tell you, we've been working hard on this all along, and we'll continue to work hard on it. The acquisitions noted in our release represent attractive additions to our positions in markets ranging from Nashville, to Dallas, to Albuquerque. In each instance, we're not only getting bigger, but we're also improving our capabilities to service our customers efficiently and effectively. John noted that we have the financial strength to invest for growth while maintaining the overall flexibility and resilience of our balance sheet. We're first and foremost going to maintain discipline and how we use our financial strength, but I expect you'll continue to see bolt-on acquisitions. These will add to our already strong organic growth trajectory and to the lasting value of our market positions over the long-term. And of course, acquisitions aren't the only growth investments we make. During 2016 for example, we invested in five new rail yards in markets such as Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina. So to wrap up, I'll note again that these are exciting times at Vulcan Materials. We're facing an extended recovery with the impact of the FAST Act just beginning to kick in. We're seeing a significant pickup in state and local transportation funding across our footprint. The pricing climate for our products remains constructive, and we're going to realize further profit margin improvements with multiple years of continued growth ahead. In addition, we enjoy the financial strength to pursue smart bolt-on acquisitions and other growth investments while also prudently returning capital to shareholders. Add to all of this, the potential for meaningful corporate tax reform and a sustained increase in infrastructure investment, I think it's easy to see why we are very excited about our future at Vulcan. And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. Certainly. And we'll go first to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning. Congratulations on a very strong 2016. I was hoping you could just step me through the bridge in terms of the sequence of shipments from October, November, December because you guys sounded pretty bullish, I think, on your last update from November 3. And I was also hoping you could kind of give us a bridge on gross profit margin? I think John called out a couple items that affected fixed cost absorption like the timing of repair and maintenance work and stripping expenses, and whether those are like one-time costs that pertain to the quarter or whether kind of a normal incremental profitability that you guys generate will be visible as we move into the new year? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah Bob, it's Tom. I'll start first with the \u2013 how we saw volumes in the fourth quarter. October and November were actually from a rates \u2013 from a shipping rates perspective, were ahead of the prior year and going very strong. The bottom line through it, at least ran out of \u2013 we ran out of time on the construction season. In 2015, we were able to ship all the way to the end of the year. And depending on the market second week, first week, third week of December we just \u2013 the season ended, and it just \u2013 that's what caught us. So I think the demand going forward is there. We're confident in 2017. The works there, in fact, was really exciting. It's going to be when the construction season starts up and who knows when that's going to be. But when it does, we'll start to see the large highway projects, that FAST Act flowing through plus some of the big non-res projects will start shipping. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Bob, I'll take \u2013 I'll start with your second question, but again, just on volume and you probably saw this referred to in our release, total business for the quarter on a shipping rate basis up 2.5%, October-November combined, that's despite the challenges that we had in California and Coastal Texas and Illinois. And just to give you a contrast, December was down 11%. So, really good momentum, particularly in our core markets, if you \u2013 core Southeastern markets, those were actually up in the quarter for the full quarter. They're up about 9% October-November on a shipping rate basis, down 7% in December, just to give you a sense for the fall off relative to last year. I'll highlight that because it kind of ties to your second question, Bob. There are really three big things in the quarter that affected unit margins in our Aggregates segment and gross profit margins in our Aggregates segment. And they're really all timing related. So the first thing we would say and call out is that the full year trends are the right trends to look at. The full year trends in terms of unit cost production being up 3% year-on-year, and then full year trends in terms of 14% improvement in unit gross profit margins in our Aggregates segment, those are the right numbers to focus on. With that said, let me kind of say what happened in the quarter. Again, really about timing, we noted first in the quarter that our unit cost of production increased 13%. Again, that compares to a 3% increase for the full year. That's all about timing of cost. So that's about $0.89 of cost increase in the quarter, that contrasts to about $0.22 for the year. Again, the $0.22 is the right number. But that timing factor by itself, it was about $30 million impact in the quarter, and it's about a 500 basis point impact to gross profit margin. So that's the big driver, is timing and costs. Again, look at the full-year trend, right numbers to look at. Two other factors; one, we called out pricing up. We had about $0.14 in the quarter of negative pricing mix both product and geographic. That's about another 100 basis points of impact on margin, still a very good thing for sales and cash flows, about a 100 basis point impact on stated gross profit margin. And then that volume fall off, it happened in \u2013 at the end of December, losing those incremental tons, which come at a higher rate of incremental gross profit. It had about another 100 basis point negative impact on margin in the quarter. Add those up, it's about again $30 million of impact due to timing differences and unit cost of production. That's really the difference between $0.89 and $0.22 across 43 million tons. It's about $6 million with negative mix on pricing. And it's \u2013 on the incremental tons, we think if we lost about 2 million tons, it's probably another 18 million of gross profit with the associated revenue that came with it. So, that's the rough walk-through. That's the way we look at it, that I come back to looking at the full year numbers is the best indication of how the business is doing, 3% growth in unit cost in our Aggregate segment, 14% growth in gross profit per ton in our Aggregate segment. Those are reflective of really what's happening in the business and they're reflective of what you see in our guidance. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's extremely helpful and clarifies what I was trying to understand. One other question, and then I'll turn it over, kind of a high-level question. It seems like you're saying this cycle is going to be stronger for longer and you're talking about mid-cycle profitability, which kind of seems like it shifted out a little bit just due to timing situation but a lot of things are going to come on in the back half of the year. I haven't heard Tom sound this optimistic in a while, and he put that out that $5 billion number there, which is a huge number in terms of balance sheet leverage if you want to buy something and free cash flow generation. What are your thoughts on capital allocation for the next 12 to 24 months? And you guys have any new thinking around that as we move closer towards mid-cycle? Thanks and good luck. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'll start with kind of a CFO view and then Tom might comment more on just the M&A landscape and how we're approaching it broadly. But our overall capital allocation priorities are unchanged. So we will \u2013 and the thing to take away is we got the flexibility to do all of these things. So it's about balance and not either or for us. We will continue to make investments back in our franchise so that's next year CapEx guidance of about $300 million. Again, that includes some carryover for this year. And again, you'll see accelerating free cash flow in the business. We continue to have incremental debt capacity staying within our investment grade parameters. That could be roughly $2 billion of incremental capacity as we move through the recovery part of the cycle. We would expect dividend to continue to grow with earnings but we're very focused on the sustainability of that dividend. As Tom noted, we are actively involved, if not aggressive on the M&A trail. We're going to stay disciplined but we have a lot of really good opportunities there. We'll continue to pursue those. And then, we will continue to look to return excess cash after all those items to shareholders via opportunistic share repurchases that makes sense. Now, all those things with the same priorities we've talked about is just \u2013 we just know that we're entering 2017 in a really good position to pursue all those things. And Tom, I'll hand it off to you, maybe talk about M&A. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, Bob. I think that you saw us close a few that we noted in the press release. Don't be surprised if you see that pattern continue. We have a lot of conviction around the continuing improving cycle. And there is a lot of M&A opportunities out there, some of which we should be the clear owner of those. It's always difficult to predict timing, but what we will say is that we'll say, stay disciplined in our acquisition process. But I think you'll probably see this pattern continue. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Nice work guys. Stay in the course. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Hey, Jerry. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm wondering if you could just flesh out for us some visibility that you have into the ramp up into the back half of 2017? You've been very clear that the first quarter is a tough comp for a while now. I'm just wondering, can you just give us some data points either large project bids or whatever underpins visibility on the significant ramp up in the back half of 2017? And within that context, can you just talk about what you're seeing in Texas specifically, that's giving you confidence that Texas will return to growth in 2017? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think that as we look at 2017, we see broad based growth in, of course, all of our segments and our geographic footprint. The Mid Atlantic and the Southeast continues to be very, very strong. As we look at our confidence \u2013 as far as the timing of that, it's really about when the construction season starts. The work's there. We have visibility of jobs, we backlog the jobs, they're ready to go, it's in every market we have, when does the sun come out and when we start shipping, and when does that begin. So, that will control the timing and that could be first quarter or second quarter, but it's going to start. I'd like to touch for a minute on California. And as we said in California, it isn't if, it's really when and we're beginning to see that win come around, it's really going to be driven by the private side in California and we'd been very focused on the private side, particularly the non-residential, and I'm pleased with our team's execution on that. I would tell you in California, our customers are a lot more optimistic than they were a year ago. And we're beginning to see those large projects let and start, and we've backlogged a number of them. I'll give you a couple examples. The new Rams Stadium, we'll start to ship in the next couple months, and this is 750,000 tons. The Mid-Coast Trolley extension in San Diego, again, it will start to ship whenever the season starts. It's about 200,000 tons. Silver Lake Reservoir is a really nice project for us because there's a lot of base and fines. And then the Otay Ranch residential project is a good example of the res that's going on in California. It's one of seven different phases of a residential project, and the first phase is 100,000 tons. And then, I'm pleased our team just closed on the LA Street contract, which is a five-year contract for asphalt, million tons of asphalt. So we're seeing California demand pick up, and it's \u2013 but, again, it's going to be driven by the private side. And I got to tell you, I'm feeling good about our execution in California and the team we have in place. So moving to Texas, I think we expect good growth, continued growth in Texas. Look, the fundamentals in Texas are all there. It's still growing. We see employment growth in Texas. We see population growth in Texas. The oil bust impact at this point on employment has really about bottomed out. So those headwinds will go away. It has the most healthy highway program probably in the country, and highway work in 2017 is very much in our footprint both in aggregates and asphalt. On the private side, res and non-res continue to grow. We'd probably \u2013 again, we bottomed out in Houston, we'd probably see some small growth in Houston. So, we expect healthy growth in Texas in 2017. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And Tom, can you comment about the Coastal Texas specifically, how much of your exposure is directly or indirectly to large-scale ethylene and LNG projects? Is it possible to tell just so we're appropriately calibrated as those projects eventually roll off? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. I think that, that really affected the compares between 2015 and 2016. We had really big projects in 2015. They really kind of finished out in 2016, and we didn't see them ever flow through again in 2016. And I would tell you, they're probably not going to flow through in 2017. There are some out there, but they're not going to start till 2018. So what's built in here is really based on the highway program and conventional res and non-res growth, not the large energy projects. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And, John, in your prepared remarks, you said the price increases were well-received so far. Can you talk about the magnitude of the price increases in 2017 compared to the price increases that you put in at the start of 2016? And specifically, were you able to put in price increases into markets where volumes were down significantly in 2016? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. I'll offer a couple comments, but I'll hand it out to Tom to kind of give you around the horn on what we're seeing in pricing, because it is really continued positive climate. First thing I'd say, Jerry, because it links into pricing is don't take our comments about back-half loaded as concerns about the underlying recovery at all. They're concerns if anything about timing, but you just heard Tom say, look, California and Texas are returning to growth for us. The rest of our franchise has been growing. Illinois should be flat, not at the same decline it had last year. So we're pretty excited about how we're set up for 2017. We're also just acknowledging a tough first quarter comp, and we're acknowledging the timing uncertainty we've seen with respect to large projects and when they actually take aggregate shipments. But, again, that's about timing, that's not about conviction in the recovery. Now, you see that in pricing. The market participants see the demand. It's a big driver. The demand coming is a big driver of the pricing climate. The magnitude of the changes varies across markets. But in total for us, the way we look at it is the compounding margin improvements we've seen should continue and continue apace and consistent with the long-term goals we've laid out. I will note in \u2013 sometimes get missed, but even in those markets that we had a lot of volume challenge last year, the Californias and Illinois as examples. We actually had quite healthy price increase. So it's not like all is bad in those markets, it's more of a temporary issue with respect to volumes. But let me hand it off to Tom to give maybe a better around the horn in what we're seeing in terms of the price increases we put in place so far. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, Jerry. With confidence in a long, gradual recovery ahead of us, the environment for price increases continues to be quite healthy. And it's driven obviously by improving demand, but also as we'll tell you, as we've always say, it's driven by the visibility that our customers have in the growing pipeline of work. We're seeing rising prices and/or margin expansions across our footprint and across all product lines. As I look at the numbers without \u2013 I'm not going to get into naming markets, but I'll give you some examples of price increases that we implemented January 1, reading down the list, $1.25, $1.35, $0.50, $1.75, $0.60. Look, these are robust price increases and there just continues to be a lot of confidence in a long sustained recovery, and it's showing up in pricing. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm sorry, just to clarify. Even markets like California and Texas that were down in 2016, you are getting significant price increases to start off 2017? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: The answer to the question is, yes. In fact, we had price increases that were very, very healthy in those markets in 2016, and we'll continue to see price increases in 2017. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Trey. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: One question, I guess is for John on the incrementals. I mean you gave us some good color on how to think about incrementals for the full year this year. And I understand that's the best way to look at the business overall. But you did also highlight the obvious tough comps we're facing here in the first quarter, not just you guys, but pretty much everybody is facing in the 1Q and how this year could be more back-end loaded. I get all that. But just for our modeling benefit, if we could get a little bit more color on how to think about the margins early in the year, especially given \u2013 coming off of a kind of a abnormal margin situation in 4Q and then you'll probably have kind of continued lack of fixed cost absorption in 1Q relative to other times in the year. Just any color, even if it's directionally on how to think about margins would be super helpful. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Trey, I'll try and give you some directional help, but you probably know what I'm going to say, which is we don't give quarterly guidance, and for a variety of reasons, particularly in a low-volume first quarter, let me just start by acknowledging that it's a little bit unpredictable. Okay? Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And I understand that. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: So I'll try and give you help, but I just want to make sure we're clear about that. I mean, keep in mind that our business as it ramps up, we're running a business now that daily shipment rates, depending where you are in the year, can range from 700,000 to 900,000 tons. It only takes a couple days shifting from \u2013 in the end of March, as an example, to have an impact on first quarter incrementals. So I'd tell you to really focus on trailing 12-month trends, and not over-read the first quarter regardless \u2013 just like we said last year's first quarter, don't over-read the blow-out numbers. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Sure. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: So all that said... Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: ...nothing that we see. There is no boogeyman in the business that we see that would lead to a slower overall rate of margin improvement. So there's some timing differences quarter-to-quarter, but there is nothing major negative out there. If I think about some of the factors at play, you already mentioned some. But diesel throughout the year, we'll see how it plays out. Our assumptions for our guidance have diesel a little bit less than $2, so that's a small headwind for us next year. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And what was the average for 2016? Sorry, just for... John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Probably a $1. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: $1.60. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: $1.60. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Rising during the year and the fourth quarter diesel was a slight headwind, but not a major headwind. And the next big factor I'd point out is just the timing of price increases, and how they flow through the work. Again, the first quarter number can be a little bit deceptive that way. But it's really difficult \u2013 our big question in the first quarter really is probably more about volume than underlying margin structure of the business. Now, we get a lot of great operating leverage and a lot of great fixed cost leverage, so without that volume it impacts our incrementals. But this is mostly about timing of volumes as opposed to seeing major changes out there on the cost horizon if that makes any sense. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's super helpful. And the big wildcard obviously being volume in the 1Q, given the tough comp is \u2013 that was kind of the reason for the question, because I know it's not easy for you guys to call, and definitely not easy for us sitting in our chairs with the kind of unique 1Q we're facing. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Once again, I know this isn't that helpful to you and that's why, again, that's why we don't give quarterly guidance. But if you think about full year trends \u2013 that continued double-digit growth in unit margins is something we still feel good about. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then, also mix played a role in 4Q \u2013 given the outlook you have for your different geographies and how they might perform, you mentioned seeing California and Texas returning to some growth there. But given that outlook and then also for your end markets, is there any kind of a mix impact, good or bad, negative or positive, I guess, that we should be thinking about as we go through 2017 and any assumptions you've laid out there? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: It's Tom. I don't see a lot of mix impact in 2017, and if it were to come from the base side, we'd be very happy with it. And it would be in additive to the volumes that would be at the high side of the volume guidance. But I think we feel pretty good about how we've looked at it and we do those budgets from the \u2013 those projections from the ground up. So I don't see a lot of mix in those numbers, and again, if it were there, we'd be pleased with it because it'd be fines and base. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We're referring to healthier product mix which... Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Sure. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: ....with \u2013 as you well know, Trey, with some of the new construction coming on, can put a little bit of downward pressure on reported average selling price, but if you look at real like-for-like pricing, that trend is still very positive. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. But you guys are reflecting that in the \u2013 in the range you gave? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We think we are in the 5% to 7%. Again, because our pricing decisions \u2013 you hear us say this all the time \u2013 are made so locally, I mean, some have been made well around this call. It can be a difficult number, but that's included in the range, the 5% to 7%. We don't see \u2013 I'm going to call it any deceleration in the pricing climate per se. We'll have mix effects across the business product and geographic, but the overall climate is \u2013 I mean, it's very consistent with last year. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. The climate is consistent. I think it continues to be healthy and it's not like you're getting price increases in asphalt rock but not in base. It's really across segments, and it's across product lines, and it's across the geographies. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And last one from me, just to kind of touch on that $5 billion that you mentioned earlier, Tom. Just to be clear that I'm making sure I understand that. And that's your expectation for cumulative free cash flow, so net of CapEx, cumulative free cash flow through the years as we kind of progress towards that mid-cycle volume. And I think you pointed to in the past is something like 250 million tons. Is that the right way to think about that $5 billion? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Two parts to it, Trey. It's roughly a $3 billion of cumulative free cash flow. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: And $2 billion of incremental debt capacity. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: And think of that incremental debt capacity is 2 to 2.25 times mid-cycle EBITDA. They were then investment grade parameters. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Okay. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: A rough number, but not \u2013 your own modeling will probably come up with something not dissimilar. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Right. I think that's right. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: And now, we're not going to get way ahead of ourselves and spend that money before we make it in some kind of crazy way. But it is a \u2013 the business model throws off a lot of cash and you know that, but that's just \u2013 it's worth thinking about. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Sure. All right. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate you taking the question. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Trey. Operator : Our next question will come from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. One is just a follow-up on pricing, as we have also seen pricing momentum improve, but I think just for the reminder for us on the call, could you go through your top five highest per unit priced markets? Because we know that there are some that have perhaps lagged on a volume basis, but it'd be helpful if you could just give us a reminder of those top five per unit priced markets? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, Kathryn, I think there is a little bit of a missed number here. Our top pricing markets are going to be, what we call remote markets. So, they're going to be on the coast where we ship products into them. And some of those may or may not be the top margin markets. Some are, some would lag some of those things. I think that \u2013 we'd tell you, it's such a local business, that's all going to be relative and the top pricing may not be the top margin. But I think the important here is that, we are seeing pretty good price increases consistent across all of our markets in all segments. I think that as those \u2013 as the projects kick in, particularly from the FAST Act and from the new state highway over 2017, 2018, and 2019, it will only continue to support price increases along with the private side, which just continues to grow. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And Kathryn, if you look at it, just building on Tom's answer, and I think \u2013 well, you know this I know, but especially if you look with a two-year or three-year view, there's a pretty good overlap between further remaining growth in the recovery and generally speaking markets that are higher margin, at least, as we sit here today. Now, we'd tell you that for the markets that are on average lower margin we're working hard to move that up, but as the recovery unfolds, that should be little bit of a tailwind to us and that we have a lot of room to go in markets that are attractive on a margin perspective already. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Just want a little bit more color on your higher stripping costs that you noted in the press release. I assume this is \u2013 you're typically building in the winter for the build up in the peak of the construction season in the spring and summer. But is it correct to assume that the higher stripping cost in part is driven by higher backlogs and expected higher demand, particularly for certain key products such as clean stone? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, Kathryn, that's exactly correct. We are making hay while the sun's shining in that we \u2013 while we don't have those shipments and don't have \u2013 well, that fell off in the second half of December gives us an opportunity to go ahead and get some work done, so that we could bank reserves that were stripped for the season that we see coming in, in 2017 and wouldn't have to go outside and maybe pay higher prices for. So this is just prudent long-term operations management. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And Kathryn, those higher stripping and repair and maintenance expenses, just to be clear for everybody, they're in the $0.22 increase in unit cost of sales that we talked about for the full year. The distortion just happens because they occurred in the fourth quarter when we happen to have lower volume. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Yeah. Understood. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And you understand those economics plus our inventory economics. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Yeah. Absolutely. One other subject I want to talk about is your non-resident market. I know there's been a lot of focus on public end market, but one of the things we're focusing on is a little bit more expansive definition of infrastructure under the new administration. Could you break out how much of your non-res end market is more heavy versus kind of your traditional or commercial kind of office type non-res projects? And if you have any view just with the change of administration on how your thoughts on traditional infrastructure versus that more expansive definition? Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I'll take the first part of that. First is that, I think we've seen really healthy growth in the non-res sector in office, lodging, warehouses, distribution. And what's lagged some is manufacturing, institutional, and government. They actually declined somewhat over the year, but I think we are seeing some return in those. The fundamentals ultimately for non-res are in a good shape. You got population growth, you got employment growth. You know the external indicators are showing strength today and you've also got really healthy residential growth, which will pull non-res behind it. I think if you look \u2013 step back and look at our footprint of where we seeing substantial strength in non-res would be the Southeast, the Mid-Atlantic, Southern California, Arizona, Texas, excluding Houston and we think that's, well, actually may show some small growth in the year. But overall, I think we see healthy growth in the non-res segment. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Kathryn, just building on that and talking a little bit about \u2013 I'm not going to call it new administration and discussions. But we probably know one thing that you're very well aware of, which is we're already exceptionally well-positioned against a number of the increases and infrastructure funding that are already happening, particularly at a state and local level. And you know that well, but (52:55) of those increases that are already happening and we're very well positioned against those, whether that's improved maintenance or new road construction or port construction or water improvement or you name it, all those things we're well positioned against. In terms of the broader definition of infrastructure and things like longer-term federal programs, one of the great things about aggregates focused business is we serve all those things. So we're absolutely fine and well positioned against a broader definition of infrastructure whether that's airports, intermodal facilities, typical transportation on and on and on and on, we're well positioned to serve substantially all of that increase in demand. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'd tell you that \u2013 I'd add to that, Kathryn, if that happens, as John said, we're in a great position for that and all of those projects will need our products. And I'd add to that, that \u2013 Vulcan Materials will be essential to building those critical infrastructure projects. I mean, that's what we do. And they don't really happen without us very well. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Great. Thank you. And final just handholding question of the $40 million EBITDA shortfall, how much of that is transitory versus any ongoing type issue? Thanks very much for answering my questions. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Kathryn, if you're referring to the quarter and what might be seen as a shortfall in gross profit margin percentage to that $40 million? Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Correct. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: If I would say that, substantially all of that is transitory or timing and that the right number to look at would be a $0.22 increase in unit cost of sales for the year and not the $0.89. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Please go ahead. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. A quick question. With all the \u2013 the $5 billion number you mentioned, Tom, it seemed like there was a lot of discussion around bolt-on sorts of acquisitions. Does that mean you're obviously fine with the footprint that's fantastic and you want to fill that in or are there larger acquisitions out there that you \u2013 that I didn't pick up on? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: We'd tell you both and those are \u2013 those, you just had to be optimistic at. When they come around, you will be on top of them. They will, I think over time you will see us do both, the ones that I think that are out there immediately. Right now we're bolt-on, but you'll see the new footprints and larger acquisitions over time. So, this is something we're excited about and we work hard on this all the time. The results although are going to be choppy and that's just a timing issue. I think, as we always talk about, the important piece here is the discipline, where do we have synergies, what's unique to us, what do we pay for them. And then once we get them, you got to go work hard and really fast to integrate them and make them make money. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And kind of turning back to the election, whether it's the lockbox in Illinois or the proposition there in California that you guys kind of mention. When do you think those can start having a meaningful impact on \u2013 well, strictly through the public piece, when can that start to flow through, those additional monies on the public side in the California market? And then, broader thoughts around the lockbox and the ability to help approve kind of the Illinois market? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think for the flow through, it's really \u2013 rule of thumb is always 18 months to 24 months now. You will see in some markets faster than that for repairs or overlays, and that just flows through past us. But by the time you collect the money, figure out which jobs you're going to do, engineer those jobs, let those jobs and they get started, it just takes that much time. And a perfect example of that is what we're going to see in the next few months in 2017 is that's how long it's taken for the FAST Act money and \u2013 states like Georgia, increases in Florida to flow through to shipments. But once they start, they start accelerating pretty fast. And so, the next two or three years or three or four years will be exciting to see the funds that we talked about two years ago flow through, these will just take a little time. Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect, guys. Thank you and good luck. Operator : Our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Thank you. I just had a question on the acquisitions, the bolt-ons you made in the fourth quarter here, early in the first quarter. How much of that is embedded in your 2017 volume guidance? And as a follow-up to that, is there any meaningful EBITDA contribution that we should be thinking about as well? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'll start, Garik. The acquisitions we announced, the total consideration for those is around $137 million. When it gets ramped up, those businesses in combination should do about $21 million in EBITDA on a kind of annual run rate basis. And obviously growing from there and there's some synergy upside beyond that. But I would assume, for your modeling, that all of that is in our guidance, particularly the EBITDA, just because we're in the process of closing some of these, bringing them on, ramping them up. And so, as we've thought about it, that is in the guidance. Likely gives us some volume upside later in the year, as we get these fully integrated into our platform, and we'll kind of communicate that as the year goes on. But, as Tom said, these are really good extensions of our existing franchise. And we hope to have more of these to talk about as the year goes on. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, I think as we talked about earlier, this is a part of the discipline with acquisitions, and this is where the real work starts, that you got to integrate them fast and accurately and bring them up to speed as fast as we can. And we'll be working hard on that in 2017 to put them in the Vulcan family and get them performing with quality earnings as fast as we can. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. So just to be clear, the 5% to 8% volume growth, we should assume that it does incorporate the acquisitions that you just made? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Just my second question is just on highway demand. You talked quite a bit about that today, but just wanted to drill in a little bit more, because it was a source of frustration in 2016, particularly from a timing standpoint. And now, we're on the federal side in continuing resolutions, some of the leading indicators on highway contract awards have been soft over the last several months. So just wanted to stress test the mid single-digit volume guidance that you have for highway demand in 2017. And any other color or any other leading indicators or any geographical indicators that you can provide us that gives you confidence in that figure versus the risk in 2017 that we could be facing a similar set of disappointing timing issues like we saw in 2016? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, if you think you were frustrated with timing and some of those in 2016, you could imagine how John and I were. But I think \u2013 we stress test that pretty hard. We've looked at this and really said, okay, do we know when it's going to start? And these are projects that \u2013 actually some of them have already started a little bit. I mean, we saw a few of these projects (1:00:58) \u2013 a few thousand tons in the fourth quarter of 2016. But I'm looking at four jobs in Atlanta right now that would have a total of about 3 million tons that we have \u2013 three out of the four have actually just started, just a little bit. And as soon as the construction season starts, those will start. I can think of three in Texas that would total over time probably over a couple \u2013 probably a couple of million tons or over 2 million tons, and those \u2013 actually those are being \u2013 just let or being let, and we know that they'll start in the second and third quarter. So I think we have a lot more visibility and confidence that these jobs are ready to go. We've already shipped a little bit on them, and we're \u2013 as I said earlier, we're really \u2013 the timing here is not what year is it going to ship in, it's when does construction season start? Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, thanks. Just the last question, I might have missed it, but didn't hear much discussion on share buybacks. As it relates to the $5 billion of available capital over the next several years, shares here down a little bit today \u2013 relative underperformers, I guess since the election compared to some of the peers. How are you balancing the view of the share price with your free cash flow versus the M&A opportunities that you talked about today? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Garik, it's John. I think no change, so \u2013 as we discussed, we work through all of our capital allocation priorities. We'll be opportunistic in how we think about share repurchases. No commitment to buy any certain amount at a certain period of time. We'll report on it after the fact. But that said, as this recovery cycle moves forward, we should have the opportunity to balance both reinvestment in the core franchise, investment in growth, both M&A and internal investment for growth, and return on capital to shareholders via mix of dividend and share repurchase. For us, it's about balancing those things given our outlook for things like M&A activity. We did not buy any shares back in the fourth quarter. You kind of saw some M&A activity that we reported on, but no real change. So I would expect through the cycle, you're going to see that investment capacity deployed to good use, and that'll be some mix of growth oriented and returning to shareholders. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rohit Seth with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the BOLD Act. And I know there's been some developments within the industry to create a successor bill to the FAST Act and there could be some overlap in the timing of when that would kick in, if it does develop as intended. Are you guys seeing any developments there? Is that something you guys are working with the trade group on? And if you have any color on that and what that impact would be on the business, that'd be great. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. The folks who worked on the BOLD Act did an outstanding job with that. It is a great idea. I think as you know right know, there's a lot of positive discussions in D.C. about infrastructure with a lot of people working really hard on solutions to funding infrastructure, which our company desperately needs and we obviously support. How that happens, we don't know yet. There's just a lot of uncertainty to it. We think it's a matter of when, not if. And when it happens, there's nobody better positioned to serve these projects than we are. It's what we do. It's who we are. It's how we started. But I think that overall, if you step back and look at this also, without any of that flowing through, you've got some very healthy highway projects coming in the next three years with increased funding from the FAST Act and from state funding, which is only increasing. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got you. And then just in the first quarter, can you comment on weather trends that you've seen thus far? Is it in a headwind or a tailwind? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think probably about neutral, with the exception of \u2013 probably a little bit of a headwind. I mean, California was very, very wet, as you well know. But with just two more months of this left and we'll just wait and see and we just don't know. Remember that 2016 was really, really good weather. But our markets look good and the work is there. So, whatever happens with the weather, the work is not going away and we'll ship it when the sun comes out. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Keep in mind that in the first quarter shipments typically accelerate through the quarter as we get more into the construction season. So I wouldn't read too much into January anyway. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And can you comment on some of the bidding activity you're seeing out there in the Southeast and in California, Texas? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. It continues to pick up both in \u2013 particularly in residential, non-residential and highway. The Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic states continue to be very, very good. We've seen Virginia pick up a little bit actually which was \u2013 it was a little bit flat last year and we're seeing it pick up. So, that is very encouraging for us. We spoke to California and Texas, both of those, particularly \u2013 both of those are healthy. Texas is, I guess, what I'd say, remains healthy and both public and private bid activity is very healthy. On the non-res side in California, I think and the res side where we continue to see it pick up and private \u2013 the private construction segment is what will drive growth in California this year. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. That's all I have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.: Oh, great. Thanks. You referenced tight construction resources in the U.S. I'm just curious how pervasive that is? And then, thinking about 2017 as a whole, is that something that could push you towards the low end of the volume guidance but maybe the high end of the pricing guidance? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think it depends on the market and when we say it's short, it's really, do they have the crews, do they have the lay down machines, do they have enough ready mix trucks and it's \u2013 it's different in every market. But I think that as you see the bidding work pick up, as the pipelines comes through the starts, that capacity will grow along with it. I think that those \u2013 that is always a healthy piece of pricing, but it is a piece of it. So it creates a healthy environment for pricing or one of things it does, but it's not the only one. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And rather than commenting just on 2017, it is a factor that's at play when we say a longer recovery could and maybe should be a more profitable recovery. But I don't \u2013 the dynamics are such that I wouldn't read too much just into 2017 on that just yet. And also to keep in mind, when we say capacity just to be clear that this really isn't our capacity. This is end-to-end construction sector. Our assets, as we sit here today, from an aggregates point of view have \u2013 they've in a single year produced more than 305 million tons of shipments. So this isn't a capacity issue for us. This is a end-to-end construction sector set of factors. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask quickly on the acquisitions you've done past four or five months. Are those all pure aggregates or are they vertically integrated? And then what's your thought on making vertically integrated acquisitions? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Well, I think as we \u2013 as some of those are aggregates, some are asphalt, some are both. And I think that as always \u2013 in our foot print, it's really not so much about vertical integration for the sake of vertical integration, it's about markets and how we view the market and how we better serve the market. So as we go forward \u2013 our strategy is always to be, as we say, grounded in aggregates. That's really \u2013 that's our bread and butter and that's what we do. But we will be \u2013 we will look at acquisitions that are vertically integrated, if they fit that whole strategy and if they fit that market. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Typically, we use the word downstream or more specifically asphalt or concrete \u2013 vertically integrated is really how we're actually approaching it. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Hey, Timna. Good morning. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Oh, afternoon. So I'll just leave it to one question, we had a lot of discussion. But I mean, on a high level, we're just wondering and kind of surprised by the pricing guidance because if you look at the 7% that you achieved overall on a high level in 2016 and the guidance of 5% to 7%, that implies that there could be a downside to the momentum in pricing. And when you match that against the potential cost pressures that you've highlighted, whether they be from some of the constraints in getting labor (1:10:00) supply in the industry or diesel, that seem to us then a little bit low. So I was just wondering, is this a conservative guide? Are you trying to be \u2013 you usually have a pretty good track record in forecasting prices, so we're just wondering if there was another dynamic that we're missing? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I don't think there's any other dynamic. I don't think we have anything built in there for big diesel increases and if we did, we'd be fine with that because over time, they help support pricing and help support margin improvements. I think we feel confident in our pricing guidance. Obviously, we're going to work hard every day to better serve our customers and make our products and our services more valuable. I think at this point, we feel pretty confident in our guidance. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So to clarify then, if you do see higher diesel costs or higher labor costs or other costs, could we see that number increase accordingly? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: First of all, yeah, cost will drive \u2013 it will help drive price. It's one of the dynamics that's always there, but from a diesel perspective sometimes it lags a little bit, but it always flows through. From a cost perspective, I think you really got to step back and look at the trend of cost in 2016, which I'd tell you, from a cost perspective over 12 months of \u2013 with very little production increases of only $0.22 and 3%, that's a pretty good trend and I like hearing that into 2017 along with the pricing momentum. So I think at this point \u2013 things will change through the year, but \u2013 and we'll adjust accordingly. But at this point, I think we're pretty confident in our guidance. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Timna, I'd add, since you asked the question this way, about cost and price. We talk about this a lot and I know you know this. We run the business on margin and cash and that's a function of pricing, it's a function of product mix and production efficiency, it's a function of our operating efficiencies and how all those things work together, not just average selling prices. So, I think if you work through the guidance, you're going to see, an implied another year of very healthy unit margin improvement and at a rate faster than pricing at the moment would dictate. So I think, reading any deceleration into margin is certainly not what we see at the moment. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Appreciate it. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. As we look forward to the 2017, so I would coin it as, we're set up well for 2017. Our long-term cost trends are very good. Our markets are showing growth. And our pricing shows the confidence of us and our customers and the whole market in that long-term growth. So thanks again for joining us. And we look forward to you sharing news in 2017. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.",

Now I would like to turn the call over to Bill to discuss the highlights for the quarter. William Sandbrook : Thank you, Jody, and welcome everyone to our call this morning. I'm very pleased to announce that despite weather-related headwinds in California and Texas, U.S. Concrete reported very strong growth in revenue from volumes and pricing, in both our ready-mixed concrete and aggregate products segments for the first quarter of 2017. Total revenue, as compared to the same period last year, increased 22% to $299 million. Income from continuing operations improved from the loss of $9.8 million to income of $7 million, and total adjusted EBITDA increased 60% to $41 million. We had income from continuing operations margin of 2.3% and a total adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.7% for the quarter, In addition, we increased our average selling prices and ready-mixed concrete raw material margins year-over-year and sequentially over the previous quarters. These continuing trends support comments we made on our year-end call. Demand remains strong in our Metropolitan markets and our leading market positions allow us to capitalize on that demand with increased volume, pricing and underlying margins. To better understand our results, you have to understand our fundamental strategy. We shape selective markets to meet our growth objectives irrespective of any underlying need for external government stimulus. Rather, our markets have been selected and developed in Metropolitan areas of the country, with higher than average mid- and long-term underlying economic growth drivers, and government funded activities simply supplement our growth rates. Our market development activities, in the high-end spectrum of the ready-mixed concrete product set, allow us to have a significant competitive advantage in competing for high-volume high-margin opportunities. The density of our plant networks allow us full low-cost market coverage to be positioned to service jobs better than competing alternative suppliers. The sheer volume of raw materials that our regional plant networks consume, makes us a very valuable customers for our cement and aggregates suppliers for which we are rewarded. Additionally, those regional plant networks are large consumers of our own internal aggregate supply which elevates our total company margin profile. The culmination of this strategy, complimented by integration synergies, has been reflected in our 2016 fourth quarter and 2017 first quarter results, and we expect these trends to continue. We have not waited for good weather to yield good results, which certainly helps but we have strategically positioned ourselves to deliver these improvements. In addition, while only 18% of our current revenues are directly generated through infrastructure project spending, we remain well-positioned to take advantage of the robust multi-year construction infrastructure spending plans that have been put into place in all of our major markets. While these initiatives, as well as FAST Act flow through funds, or some future enhanced federal infrastructure spending would be a tailwind, we're not waiting for government-funded projects to improve our results. Our year-over-year organic growth rate in ready-mixed concrete for the first quarter of 2017 was approximately 3%. We estimate that the increment weather in Northern California in Quarter 1 of 2017 caused the delay in delivering approximately 1,000 cubic yards of ready-mixed concrete, which would have represented a year-over-year organic growth rate for ready-mixed concrete volumes of approximately 9%, absent these weather-related delays. We believe that our platform will continue to deliver consistent results for the balance of the year with high single-digit growth in ready-mixed concrete organic volumes for the full year of 2017, along with mid-single-digit growth in pricing. We are optimistic that these organic growth trends could continue for the next several years. In addition, we believe our strategic focus and approach to acquisitions will allow us to expand and strengthen our positions in existing and potentially new markets to meet the higher demand resulting from these capital plans and general construction growth. Our acquisition approach also includes strengthening our aggregates product position around our ready-mixed concrete operations. On April 7, we acquired certain assets of Corbett aggregate, a provider of high-quality concrete sand in Southern New Jersey. The acquisition furthers our strategy in vertical integration and increases our self-sufficiency on internal aggregates in a market where natural sand is rapidly depleting. In addition, our ability to move these materials by water, using our strategic portfolio of distribution docks in the New York metropolitan area, reduces our dependency on third-party suppliers and land-based truck deliveries. Beyond this acquisition, we continue to have a large, attractive pipeline of potential accretive acquisitions which we expect to further enhance and supplement our organic growth. We expect that our acquisition pipeline will enable us to enter a new major Metropolitan market this year. I'll now take you through each of our markets. In Northern California, which represented 20% of our revenue this quarter, significant rainfall for the second straight quarter resulted in continued deferral of sales volumes. Demand remains strong in the Bay Area with many projects now underway and several large projects recently awarded, including the new Google campus, Warriors Arena and The San Francisco Redevelopment Project. On April 28, Gov. Jerry Brown, signed The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. The bill provides $52 billion in transportation funding over the next 10 years with $41 billion allocated to state, local roads, highways, bridges and trade quarters. The comprehensive funding plan was passed to partially address with its state notes is approximately $140 billion backlog of deferred maintenance on state and local roads. We have an extensive plant network in the Bay Area and we remain active to capture the pent-up demand driven by weather-related delays, organic growth in technology sector and the recent approval to transportation bill. In the greater New York metro area, which represented 34% of our revenue in this quarter, we continue to see strong demand for offices, hotels and multifamily residential in the entire region. On April 10, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, signed the affordable New York Housing Program as the successor to the expired 421a tax abatement program. The bill is aimed to stimulate multifamily residential construction in New York City, which should provide 2,500 new affordable apartments annually through 2022. Because of the expiration of 421a, future projects for the Hollis area of Queens were put on hold. These projects are now back on track on with plans for more than 2,000 new apartment units to be built on the waterfront in Astoria. The New York metro area was ranked the top metro area for new multifamily permits through February 2017, with an 88.4% increase over the prior-year period. We have significantly increased and strengthened our New York City market position over the last year to capture not only the robust residential and commercial project pipeline but also the increased demand arising from the Port Authority's recently approved long-range capital plan. The 10-year $32 billion plan will refocus on redevelopment and revitalization of the metro area's infrastructure. In addition, in a report recently issued by the New York Economic Development Corporation, $1.6 billion in public and private funding is being directed towards the revitalization of the North Shore waterfront on Staten Island. The development, which will generate over 2,000 new jobs and include over 4,000 housing units and 200,000 square feet of space, will include new housing, major retail developments, iconic attractions, transportation upgrades and waterfront parks. Our unrivaled plant network, in the New York City market and in Staten Island in particular, will allow us to capture a significant portion of the increased demand from this additional robust project pipeline on Staten Island. Our Washington D.C. and Northern Virginia markets remain an area of significant growth. Over 100 projects have currently broken ground representing over 20 million square feet and $9 billion of construction to be delivered in the next 3 years. Our ready-mixed concrete plants are well-positioned to take advantage of the population influx in the area driving office, retail and residential construction. In Dallas, Fort Worth, which represented 30% of our revenue this quarter, we remain extremely active in this very vibrant market. DFW has one of the strongest population inflows and employment growth rates in the country. Housing permits have increased 55.3% from this time last year and continued growth is expected. Dallas/Fort Worth was already the top apartment building market in the U.S. before starts increased by 95% in the first 2 months of 2017. Over 50,000 units are currently under construction with less than 5% of the current units unoccupied. The nonresidential sector is also expanding at a rapid pace. For instance, Kohler recently announced that its planning to build a 1.3 million square foot distribution facility in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. CyrusOne just announced plans for a new data center on 64 acres in Allen, and Facebook continues to grow in the region with another data center in Fort Worth. Opportunities continue to expand in this market and we continue to add to our backlog, which increased once again this quarter and is 16% higher in the DFW Metroplex than this time last year. Our West Texas region, which comprised 10% of our first quarter revenue, continues to contribute very favorably to our results. As we have discussed on past calls, this market mainly comprises operations west of Fort Worth, in the Wichita Falls, Abilene, Lubbock, Odessa and San Angelo areas. Although growth had slowed over the last year, Dodge projects compound annual growth in ready-mixed concrete volumes of almost 6% over the next 4 years in this region. The active rig count in the Permian Basin has increased 120% from the end of the first quarter last year. We operate in a diverse range of economies throughout the West Texas region where we enjoy favorable industry dynamics and a higher mix of vertically integrated aggregate positions that should allow us to capitalize on future accelerated growth. Overall, the economic fundamentals across our markets continue to indicate a very positive outlook and we have a healthy pipeline of projects for 2017. Ready-mixed concrete backlog continues to increase and as of March 31, 2017 was approximately $7.4 million cubic yards, up 13% for the same time last year. Now I would like to turn the call back to Jody to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. Joseph Tusa : Thanks, Bill. We were very pleased with our first quarter results with the continuation of our track record of profitable growth, and which were highlighted by a 25th consecutive quarter year-over-year revenue growth. We have also delivered stronger balance sheet metrics and continue to enhance cash flow generation. We reported to $299.1 million of revenue. Income from continued operations of $7 million and total adjusted EBITDA of $41.1 million. Our ready-mixed concrete average selling price increased to $134.28 per cubic yard as compared to $126.44 per cubic yard for the same period last year, an increase of 6.2% to achieve a 24th straight quarter of year-over-year price increases. We also improved our year-over-year ready-mixed concrete raw material margins from $62.78 on a dollar per cubic yard basis to $66.70. In aggregate products we increased our sales volumes by 4% and our average selling prices by 10.6% versus the same period last year. During the quarter, consolidated revenue increased 22.1% on a year-over-year basis on higher volume and average selling prices in both ready-mixed concrete and aggregate products along with the impact of acquisitions we made during 2016. In ready-mixed concrete, we improved our average selling price by 6.2% as compared to the same period last year. These price increases drove increases in our raw material dollar per cubic yard margins during the first quarter 2017, due to strength of our position in each of our markets. Looking forward to the balance of 2017, we expect to continue to improve both our ready-mixed concrete average selling prices and dollar per cubic yard raw material margin spreads, in part due to high levels of demand in our markets and our proven ability to pass along raw material price increases to our customers. First quarter 2017 ready-mixed concrete revenue increased by $51.4 million, or 22.9% year-over-year, and our ready-mixed volume increased 16.2% to 2 million cubic yards with higher average selling prices driving the remaining component of this revenue increase. We believe these trends in selling prices and margin expansion reflect a continued strong construction activity in the well-structured markets where we operate. During the first quarter of 2017, aggregate products revenue increased by $2.7 million, or 17.7% year-over-year, to $17.8 million. Approximately 50% of our aggregates product shipments were supplied internally to our ready-mixed concrete operations across our vertically integrated positions. Looking at our profit and margins. First quarter 2017 income from continuing operations increased to $7 million from a loss of $9.8 million in the prior-year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, total adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 60% to $41.1 million compared to $25.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Income from continued operations, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 2.3% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to a negative 4% in the prior-year first quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of revenue, was 13.7% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 10.5% in the prior-year first quarter. Notably, our ready-mixed concrete raw material margins, as a percentage of revenue, continue to remain near the 50% level in the first quarter of 2017, despite weather-related volume challenges in California, which is one of our highest margin regions. Our SG&A expense in the 2017 first quarter, was 8.6% of revenue compared to 9.5% of revenue in the prior-year quarter. We continue to aggressively manage our SG&A expense levels and expect this metric to continue to improve as we drive organic growth and complete the integration of acquired companies. On a GAAP basis, our net income was $6.9 million in the 2017 first quarter or $0.42 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income from continuing operations was $9 million or $0.55 per diluted share for the first quarter, representing a 77.4% increase compared to the prior-year period. The adjusted net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2017, is net of a normalized tax rate of 40%. This normalized tax amount is consistent with our positions as a full cash taxpayer in 2017. Now moving on to cash flow and balance sheet. As I mentioned in our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings call, in January we closed a $200 million add-on to the $400 million single and secure notes we issued in June of 2016. We are very pleased with the execution of the placement of this add-on as it was priced at 105.75% of par value, which further improves our cost of capital. We deployed a portion of our cash position, as of March 31, 2017, for the cash at closing for the, Corbett acquisition in April, 2017, and based on our acquisition pipeline, we continue to expect to efficiently deploy the net proceeds from this tack on notes offering in 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, we generated $29.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities as compared with $20 million in the prior-year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated $19.6 million of adjusted free cash flow as compared to $9 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily as a result of improved operating profit. We continue to maintain a critical focus on working capital management, particularly in our cash collections and timing of vendor payments. We spent approximately $10.7 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2017, mainly to purchase plant, machinery and equipment in support of growing demand in our markets, compared to $11.2 million for the same period last year. As of March 31, 2017, the book value of our long-term debt, including current maturities, was $658.6 million. This included $611 million of unsecured senior notes due in 2024, no amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility and approximately $58.6 million of other debt consisting mainly of equipment financing for new mixer trucks and mobile equipment, less $11 million of debt issuance costs. As of March 31, 2017, we had total liquidity of $500 million, including $291.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $208.2 million of availability under our revolver. Our availability is net of an $18.1 million reserve for outstanding loans of credit in sales tax and other reserves. Our availability is also limited by the eligible amount of our accounts receivable, inventory and rolling stock, which was $226.3 million as of March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2017, our total debt-to-LTM income from continuing operations was 25x and our net debt-to-LTM total adjusted EBITDA ratio remains conservative at 2.09x, which would be lower on a pro forma basis with the full run rate of EBITDA from acquisitions we completed in 2016. We ended the quarter with a strong capital position to continue investing in our business, in deploying capital opportunistically on select accretive growth opportunities. I'll now turn the call back over to Bill. William Sandbrook : Thank you, Jody. I want to take a minute to thank Jody for his hard work and dedication to the success of U.S. Concrete over the past year and a half. Leading 2 extremely successful debt raises has been instrumental in positioning the company for future growth. We wish him the best of luck in his professional endeavors. As to our progress, we are actively engaged in the CFO search and have progressed to the interview stage with numerous very highly qualified candidates. I'm confident that we will seamlessly seat a high caliber individual in the role, without missing a beat, as we have a seasoned finance team in place to assist in the transition. We are pleased to continue to deliver on our growth objectives and create a sustainable platform for continued success. We continue to believe that the construction cycle has a healthy runway for continued expansion. We have established our company in attractive geographic markets with leading share positions to deliver consistent profit improvement and generate attractive returns for many years to come. As we look to the balance of 2017, we're optimistic on the prospects for growth in our existing markets and our acquisition pipeline remains a viable avenue for additional growth, including potential new Metropolitan market areas and increased vertical integration with additional aggregates. We expect our markets to continue to outpace the national average for construction spending, allowing us to maintain our relentless focus on our 2-pronged strategy. The first, grow organically through operating excellence, superior product delivery and service. And second, expand through acquisitions that bolster our existing market positions and capitalize on potential opportunities in new high-growth markets. We expect that the disciplined execution of our strategic growth plan should lead to increased value for our shareholders. Thank you for your interest in U.S. Concrete. We look forward to updating you on our future successes. We would now like to turn the call back over to Sabrina for the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Rohit Seth : Just trends in the footprint, clearly you had strong volumes, margins were good in the ready-mix, given the rain in California. Are you seeing that volume come back? William Sandbrook : In California, Seth, or overall? Rohit Seth : Yes, in California. William Sandbrook : Yes it was. The weather has moderated obviously, it's more conducive to placing and pouring and supplying concrete. So I would - it's as simple as just watching the weather in any of our footprint, and specifically in California, because all of the pent-up demand for our projects that were delayed. Rohit Seth : You already had good margin expansion in the first quarter, so it's fair to assume that 2Q could get, I guess significantly better just on the change in the mix? Joseph Tusa : Seth, this is Jody. As you rightly noted down, and as we included in our commentary, Northern California is one of our highest margin markets and so Q2 and Q3 are generally our strongest quarters, and with that volume coming into the mix, we would expect improvement directionally in Q2 and the margins. Rohit Seth : And the backlog was also up pretty nicely. Can you provide any color on the mix of projects entering the pipeline? William Sandbrook : The mix are fairly consistent. We have seen a little bit more influx in the transportation infrastructure area, as you can well imagine from some flow through of the FAST Act and some of these other projects that we won, notably the LaGuardia Airport which is in the infrastructure side. We shift it little bit for Q1, 2017, we shifted a little bit more into the infrastructure side at 18%, decreased marginally in the commercial industrial sector, dropped from 60% to 56%. Res is up now 0.2. So a minor shift into the res. Rohit Seth : Okay. And then the California infrastructure bill, you touched on that. I know you haven't historically gone after that market, but I'd imagine it's going to change your market dynamics in California. How do you see this playing out, if we assume that tomorrow is going to be the beginning of the big lift in the amount of spending? How would you anticipate the dynamics play out for you guys specifically? William Sandbrook : I wouldn't characterize as we haven't gone after those job or haven't focused on those jobs. You remember 2 years ago, we completed the Oakland Bay Bridge which is a massive infrastructure project. So it's more opportunistic. So the more of the opportunities are there for enhanced margin difficult to perform projects, we would focus more of our capacity towards those. They just haven't been that available in some of our markets because of the lack of the infrastructure spend available. So as more projects become available, we'll focus more on that for our existing capacity. Rohit Seth : And then, on the New York City plan that I know the awards are up pretty significantly, I calculated 70%. Is that stuff coming to the market yet from the city of New York? William Sandbrook : Not as a result of the new plan passed by Governor Cuomo. Those would've been done irrespective of that maybe on the come, hoping that there would be a replacement for the 421a program, but this is - the projects that we are doing now, they've been planned 1 year to 2 years ago, so all of this is to come. Rohit Seth : Got you. And then on the M&A front. You did that acquisition in South Jersey. I think you talked about it supplying the New York operation, but I kind of looked at that as potentially the beachhead into Philly. Is that the right way to think about as well? William Sandbrook : It's close to Philadelphia but the purpose of that acquisition was primarily to self-consume in our existing ready-mixed operations where sand is extremely expensive and expensive to truck-in from various land-based sources. So it could give us opportunities for additional markets in the future, the primary reason for that was self-consumption in the five boroughs of New York. Rohit Seth : And you're still looking south in terms of entering new geographic markets? Anything change on that front? Joseph Tusa : We're looking in all potential markets, east-west, north-south. Our preferred is high-growth urban markets, but we are looking across the country. William Sandbrook : The strategy around markets, not only geographically, but the characteristics of those markets are still very consistent with what we communicated over the last year. Rohit Seth : Just on the cost structure production cost per unit, seems to be coming down. I know you guys look at it differently but just from your public statements looks like it's coming down. Is that synergy coming from the New York operations and you know we have 2 quarter with actuals since you did those and is it fair to assume kind of the overhead and labor cost we're seeing, that's good run rate to project forward? William Sandbrook : As far the synergies, the New York market we had 4 acquisitions within the last 12 months and it takes 18 months to 24 months to fully synergize them. So as that clock ticks forward and with those companies under our umbrella and the rationalization of the operating footprint, so that we can more effectively and more cost-effectively and more cheaply service large projects, comes into our operating model that obviously is going to help our operating costs. I can - irrespective of post-acquisition synergies. We are constantly striving for operational and process improvements. Operator : And the next question will come from the line of Craig Bibb with CJS Securities. Craig Bibb : It look here the volume growth was really encouraging given the rain in California, you have a tough compare in Dallas. Was this a New York-driven quarter? William Sandbrook : Obviously we were impacted negatively in California, so the results that we did put on the paper had to overcome that and it would be a combination of New York and Dallas Metroplex, Northern Texas. Craig Bibb : Okay. It looks like your contribution, given the spread between organic growth and total growth, your contribution from your New York purchases appear to be as well above what I was expecting. Was New York less seasonal than normal in Q1? William Sandbrook : It had marginally - it had basically marginally improved weather, except if you remember at the end of March, the third week of March we had that big blizzard in New York. So we had to overcome that as well in the last 2 weeks, and obviously, March is seasonally better weather than January and February and then we lost a full week in March. I'm very pleased with our results even given some weather disruptions in that market. Craig Bibb : And the naysayers on your stock are concerned that New York is going to slow down. Are you guys seeing that? William Sandbrook : No, from my commentary, what's in the project pipeline, what we papered, what we're working on right now, what's in our backlog, what's not even in our backlog but was projected on Staten Island with the Port Authority spend and the governor's new proposal for the 421a replacement, I'm very happy to be operating in New York with a footprint we have. Craig Bibb : It sounded like you're a little bit more optimistic about the D.C. market. Is there potential for M&A and building out your position there? William Sandbrook : Yes, we are looking in that market, as all of our markets for potential opportunities. I'm optimistic about the growth prospects in D.C. as well. Craig Bibb : Okay. And then last one. Are there any looming costs for trucks, drivers, maintenance or anything that could derail margins later in the year? Joseph Tusa : No, Craig, as Bill mentioned, the effort continually on further optimizing the cost structure is very active. Maintenance CapEx that we have mainly for our truck fleet, is very predictable as you know. And so we don't expect or see spikes in any of the cost components that would be unanticipated or in the organic CapEx as well. Operator : And the next question comes on the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms : I've got 9 questions I want to ask to but I'll probably just keep it to 2 since its earnings season. That was a joke. The deferred 100,000 tons that you're talking about, you said just watch the weather but - excuse me, not 100,000 tons, 100,000 cubic yards, you said kind of watch the weather in California that sort of thing. But do we - is capacity there to get it all done in 2Q? Or is that something just takes a bit longer to kind of roll out, just depending on the ability to get the work done? The manpower? Joseph Tusa : Yes, Trey. Just - very similar to what we experienced with the heavy rainfall in the past 2 years in the state of Texas. It takes more than just 1 quarter to absorb that level of disruption. So that maybe 2 quarters or 3 quarters to get all of that work back into the schedule, and remember, that as Bill mentioned, Northern California is very, very active market right now. So that we don't expect to get fully made up in Q2. Trey Grooms : Okay, got it. And then you mentioned about West Texas obviously starting to improve. What's the opportunity - you said 10% of sales but just trying to get an idea of what the opportunity is there? How much is at all from a few years ago? I would think it would be pretty considerable, but just trying to gauge the opportunity you have in West Texas because I think that's a market that goes - kind of doesn't get much attention with the Dallas/Fort Worth being a bigger market for your guys and a hot market just trying to gauge the opportunity there. Joseph Tusa : Yes, Trey. The opportunity is significant, particularly as some components of the energy patch continue to recover, mainly around the Permian, and so the capacity there, you have to look at a little different from say the Dallas market proper. And so the capacity to ramp up is pretty significant in the West Texas market. You are correct, that 10% of revenue component is down from previous year. So there is opportunity to move that up and the capacity - and we'll largely depend on the timing and size of projects that come into that market. Operator : In the next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis. Adam Thalhimer : I want to ask a first on ready-mixed volumes. I don't know how granular you really want to get. Does the environment exists that would support continued double-digit growth? William Sandbrook : We've answered that, that we expect high single-digit organic growth. Supplemented by selective acquisitions that we're able to accomplish. So we're right under double-digit if you're counting 10 as a double digit. So I would stick with outside of any acquisitions those high single-digit projections we've given you. Adam Thalhimer : Maybe on to the acquisition strategies. You look at new metro areas. What's the preferred way to enter those? Is it, buy 5 or 6 smaller companies? Or is it buy 1 big company? William Sandbrook : It depends on the market. The ultimate endgame is what you have to keep in mind, you have to have a path to consolidation so that we can replicate the market concentration and the ability of purchase raw materials extremely cost effectively and the ability to cover an entire metro region with a robust plant network. So depending on the underlying commercial characteristics and competitive environment within each of those regions, would dictate the strategy. So it's situational, depending on the underlying market fundamentals or dynamics with in each of those metro areas. Adam Thalhimer : And then I wanted to ask lastly, on cement price increases. How successful were those in your markets for the spring? William Sandbrook : Success like beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. As I said in my prepared comments, our ability to buy large quantities of cement and aggregates in our markets allow us to be very efficient in our purchases, vis-\u00e0-vis what some of our smaller competitors might have to pay. Our supplier's value our volume. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : I saw the metrics you offered, the high single-digit volume growth, mid-single digit price organic, even with the potential to sustain that over the next few years. Any sense of what kind of margin expansion you kind of see from that? Because I know you have some easier comps this year, so it's not necessarily apples-to-apples after this year? Joseph Tusa : Well. I think, Brent, we've been pretty consistent in saying that we do expect mid-single digit price increases for ready-mix and we see that it, also in our prepared remarks today, that potential to continue for a few years. So the way we look at it is with that kind of pricing power, with a position that we have in our markets, we would have the ability to further widen out the margin spread, and so we have some variabilities, as you know, in our margins by markets but we are very well poised to take advantage. Not only have improving the volumes in our higher-margin markets, but also widening out our margin spreads across everywhere where we operate. Brent Thielman : Okay. And then Bill, as you look out over the next few years not just California but the whole spread of assets you got. Do you think the business overall is likely to see a more material shift towards infrastructure work that you have in the past. And if that's the case, even if you go after these more complex jobs, is that still somewhat of a headwind in terms of the ASP and continue to grow at the pace you have. William Sandbrook : No I don't think it's a headwind at all. Because some of these infrastructure jobs are very complicated with significantly difficult quality specifications that not all ready-mix suppliers can perform to, as well as the service requirements of the number of trucks and robust plant networks. So I think that those are very high-priced high-margin opportunities, so I don't look at that as a headwind at all. We're not counting on it because some of these plants we still have to see the fruition and the flow through of the dollars to actual projects, but I would consider that a tailwind to our existing base of business which is very healthy right now, but not a headwind at all. Operator : And the next question comes on the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : On the price mix, both on or the price side both on ready-mix and on the aggregates, can you break out what was a regional impact, maybe what was a product mix impact, anything to help with that? Or should we just assumed that's just straight price? William Sandbrook : There are mix implications there obviously, but in this respect it kind of works. Our underlying price worked in favor of the shifting mix. Obviously, the 2 coasts are more expensive ready-mix and because of the decline in volume, because of the weather impacts in California, we lost some of that high-priced California pricing. So when you see a mid-single-digit or a 6% price increase, that's overcoming a mix shift that goes against us. So there's very strong underlying fundamental pricing dynamics in all of our markets. Stanley Elliott : And did you say the Texas market was a little soft as well or not soft but just had some weather impacts. William Sandbrook : It did have some weather impacts; it's been noted in various forms over the last couple of days. In our markets, when you look at the precipitation rank first quarter 2017 versus first quarter 2016. In our major Texas market, would be the Dallas Metroplex it was a 74th wettest quarter on record. Last year was the 59th so marginally wetter in Dallas. And as far as our West Texas markets, last year it was the 39th wettest which is fairly low out of 118 years. And this year was the 109th wettest. So there were impacts in our West Texas business, minor impacts in our Dallas business which we overcame. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. And now with the business at a steady state you certainly feel like we're hearing more about in-fill acquisitions in the past. I was thinking more kind of new platforms; I know that was still on the table for you. But am I correct in picking up that there seems to be more in-fill deals within existing markets kind of in the - on the wish list now? William Sandbrook : I would say that we desire to get both we have been very consistent, not only in in-fills new markets and in aggregate vertical integration. But I think there has been some more opportunities, some more sellers that have surfaced over the last 6 months. So wouldn't necessarily be our wish list has changed but opportunities to execute deals that weren't previously available to us, now are coming into the mix a little bit. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. And then last for me with a steady run rate business. Where we're doing now with good volume, good pricing outlook? Would you guys just hazard a guess kind of what you see as a margin potential within this new business kind of as it stands now, or is this still too early to say? Joseph Tusa : Stanley, we've mentioned in the past that moving the EBITDA - the total adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-teens range and we are quite close in the performance in this quarter, is how we look at the business overall. So we do think there are still opportunities to further optimize the cost structure and then as I mentioned continue to widen out the raw material margin spreads. So that's sort of how we're looking at it in the near-term and again, based on the performance in Q1, that looks quite achievable. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Scotch Schrier with Citi. Scotch Schrier : I wanted to follow up on a couple of questions as you think about the infrastructure opportunity that you discuss. Do you plan on whether its green fielding new batch plants anywhere to kind of broaden out your footprint away from some of the metro areas to get more exposure to some of these infrastructure opportunities? Or how can we think about your footprint versus where some of these big infrastructure opportunities could be? William Sandbrook : Sure. That's not a primary objective of our strategy. We do have mobile concrete plants and division that historically has followed infrastructure work, wind farm work for instance in Colorado, Montana, Oklahoma. We've kind of moved away from that to some extent because you just - it's difficult to find competitive advantages when you come into another market where you don't have a presence in, both in raw material purchasing and sourcing labor, and competing for that work with existing players that are in that market. Now having said that, when there are large infrastructure projects within our existing geographies, when we are at a fairly high level of capacity utilization within those major Metropolitan areas, it's our preferred means of supplying that job with a portable operation that supplements our existing fixed-plant capacity. So I would look at it more that we've had the ability, even when our other plants are busy, to set up additional capacity within markets that we currently exist to take advantage of those opportunities. Scotch Schrier : I want to follow up on the margin questions, and maybe hit it another way Jody. When I look at your incremental margins for the quarter, obviously, they were very strong. So is this a good run rate to think about the cadence of this margin expansion that you refer to? Were there any one-off items in there? Or are we just at a point where you are just leveraging your fixed cost you have that pricing power so this level of operating leverage is a good way to think about the business? Joseph Tusa : Yes. It's really the latter, Scott. So there were no one-time or nonrecurring types of components in the cost structure that drove these results, and so as you look at margins overall or on an incremental basis, we do think that trajectory is a good way to look at what will continue in the coming quarters and years. And it's attributed to the components exactly that you mentioned. Just underlying fundamentals improving in pricing, improved volumes over the fixed cost structure and further optimizing various components of our overall cost. Scotch Schrier : Great. And lastly I want to hit the question again, specifically the New York, so I see a lot of these projects you do here in our backyard and as you've alluded they're complicated so you have significant pricing power in those. If I think about the fact that we've some new cement capacity coming online, whether it's both in upstate New York and Canada, does that give you an even more opportunity to really push that materials spread, given that you might have some more purchasing power with the supply in the market versus the fact that you do have these projects where you're able to push pricing a little further? William Sandbrook : Yes. Interesting that the capacity question in New York. Some of that excess capacity is going to be used up by overall market demand with us and our competitors, so I'm not that concerned about that. To the extent that we can efficiently take advantage of cost opportunities because of excess cement capacity our own purchasing ability because of the amount that we buy and our leverage in that relationship, and as we keep getting value for our products and service and delivery, as you've said, they're very complicated project and not many people - not many companies can do them and there has to be an inherent value for our customers in using us. That combination should continue to allow us to increase spreads. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Sandbrook, President and Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. William Sandbrook : Thank you, Sabrina. Thank you, everyone, for participating in the call this morning, and for your continued support of U.S. Concrete. This concludes our call, and we look forward to discussing our second quarter results with you later this summer. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude your program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

My name is Lena, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. And now I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren - Vulcan Materials Company : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Before we begin, let me call you attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website, vulcanmaterials.com. You can access the presentation from the Investor Relations homepage of the website. Rather than review each slide specifically during our call today, we will provide the key highlights in our prepared remarks in order to allow more time for your questions. Before we begin, let me remain you that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you, Mark, and we appreciate your joining us for the call today. So let's get right to the key points. In spite of aggregate shipments in the quarter being hit hard by a rough weather across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, and by specific circumstances in Illinois and Coastal Texas, our unit margins in Aggregates reached a second-quarter record, and the pricing climate remains positive. In addition, our visibility to a turn in public construction activity continued to improve. There are more highway project tons in backlog than we've seen in at least three years. Private non-residential starts in our markets are now growing. They've gone from plus 1% a year ago to plus 8% today. In both highways and private non-res, our markets are outperforming non-Vulcan served markets in starts growth. In addition, highway starts in Vulcan markets are up 7%. Although we have lowered our outlook for aggregate shipments in this calendar year, we see the second half of 2017 returning to growth. The shortfall in aggregates volumes drove most of the gap between our reported results and expectations for the quarter. Shipment results are highly variable across geographies just like you'd expect given the dynamics I mentioned earlier. For example, shipments for Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were down 12% compared to the prior-year second quarter, well off trends and expectation. This was largely due to weather and its impact on project timing. At the same time, Illinois and Coastal Texas shipments were down 19% and 12% respectively. This was driven by severe reductions in large project work. Yet our backlogs in coastal Texas and Illinois, like most of our markets are very strong and growing. Our other markets combined saw shipment growth of over 6%. This is much more in line with expectation and trend. This growth came despite very tough weather in the East, with the West showing very strong shipments, as expected. It is important to note that the factors negatively impacting second quarter shipments are contradicted by strong underlying demand trends. In fact, looking behind the quarter's reported numbers, I'm very encouraged by what I see. Leading indicators for shipments continue to strengthen, with public construction beginning to exit from the lull experienced over the last 12 months. Private demand continues to recover across most of our footprint, with key states such as California and Virginia showing renewed momentum. Long-term project pipelines for both private and public transportation work continue to build. And now, we're seeing the rate of starts for transportation infrastructure projects returning to growth. A year ago, these starts for Vulcan markets were down 16% on a trailing 12-month basis. This led to a drag on our shipments. Today they're up 7%, and we're seeing meaningful improvements in our backlogs in markets ranging from California to Illinois to Georgia. Customer confidence remains very strong given this visibility, and the pricing climate remains positive. Pricing for the quarter was up about 6%, taking into account product and geographic mix. On a normalized basis, our cash margin per ton in aggregates improved by 7%. Now, this is despite wet material, which is hard to process; on-again, off-again production schedules; and expensive production splits. To give you a better feel for the quarter, I'll briefly compare and contrast two of our important states, California and Georgia. They illustrate clearly the variability in the quarter, but also the quality of the profit improvement that we're seeing at the local level. In California, we saw volume improve by 10%. This is the beginning of the recovery we saw coming in 2016. Pricing improved by 7%, and overall unit profitability improved by 49%. This is consistent with the strong operating leverage that we enjoy. This California growth reflects a strong and strengthening private market, and this is before we feel the impact of additional state and local highway funding of approximately $6 billion per year. This will drive dramatic improvement in the public market. In California, we are also a major supplier to massive projects like the new Rams stadium, which was delayed slightly in the first quarter and has now begun shipping. Now to Georgia. For those of you close to the industry, you know Georgia is a strong market. However, in the quarter things slowed down considerably due to DoT delayed projects and weather. For example. Atlanta had 25 rain days in May and June. These factors contributed to a volume decline of 13%. But I'm not worried about Georgia, Georgia is going to be fine. The fundamental demand outlook remains solid. It is supported by both private construction activity and a defined slate of public transportation projects. Pricing for the quarter in Georgia rose a healthy 8%. This is a strong sign of underlying demand strength. We lowered our volume expectations for the year, which lowered our guidance range. This is due to compression of shipping days and the timing of large projects that we know are going to ship. In addition, I'm very pleased by our growing project backlogs, growing public and private starts, and the growing preconstruction pipeline. We feel confident that we will return in the second half of the year to a sustained period of growth. To underscore the point, the backlog of large projects in Georgia where Vulcan will be the major supplier continues to swell. Big highway projects like the I-75/16 work in Macon and the I-285/400 expansion in Atlanta have been delayed by the DOT as well as by weather. But they will start to ship soon. Now I'll hand it off to John, who will walk you through the details of the quarter and discuss outlook and financing activities. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Tom. I'd like to begin by underscoring that our business remains on track with our long-term goals for mid-cycle profitability. Aggregate shipment shortfalls to date led us to reduce our outlook for the current calendar year. But at the same time, key leading indicators for shipments for the balance of this year and beyond have strengthened in important ways. The pricing climate continues to reflect this confidence in the sustained recovery, and more tactically, the healthy backlogs we and our customers see. The operating leverage inherent in our aggregates-focused model remains intact. And where we've seen good revenue growth, we've seen good flow-throughs. Our expectations for free cash flow growth also remain unchanged. Now I'll dig a bit further into our outlook for the balance of the year. As you've seen, we are lowering our guidance for 2017 due to our reduced expectation for aggregates shipments. We now anticipate full-year shipments of between 182 million tons and 187 million tons. A few comments regarding our outlook for the second half. Starts data for public transportation infrastructure projects historically serve as a reliable leading indicator of our shipments to that end-use, with a lag depending upon the nature of the project. The turn we are now seeing is due to a higher proportion of larger, more complex projects, and as such can drive a longer lag between a project start and our shipment of aggregates to that project. That said, we're pleased to see the turn in this indicator for our markets, as well as the solid growth in our internal backlogs. We take these as clear signals that we are exiting the lull in public transportation shipments experienced over the last 12 months and returning to a next wave of growth, one characterized by strength in public demand joining the continuing recovery in private demand. The long-term pre-construction pipeline continues to build, and we're finally beginning to see that core demand flow through to growth and project starts and our own shipments. Now again, private starts momentum remains solid across Vulcan's footprint, and in fact, it's already showing up in our shipments. For example, we are experiencing particular strength in shipments to private end-uses across the Southeast, and now in Virginia and California as well. So we feel very good about the fundamental demand drivers and about the leading indicators in near-term shipments. But for the second half of 2017, we remain cautious regarding the ultimate timing of shipments to selected large projects, as well as the ability of our customers to fully catch up on work deferred from the first half. In addition, the turn in starts and shipments related to public transportation projects, although very encouraging, has come a bit late in some markets to fully impact 2017 as originally expected. Of note, our aggregate shipments for July were up 2% over the prior year. Most Southeastern markets showed improved momentum as the month progressed and as weather improved. However, we've yet to see a full return to growth in Illinois and Coastal Texas despite strong backlogs in those markets. Our lowered volume outlook primarily reflects the simple reality of the number of shipping days left in the calendar year. We see a return to solid growth but don't know that we can fully catch up to our original guidance in the months remaining. Our current outlook for the remainder of the year, August through December, implies 5% to 10% growth in aggregate shipments over the prior-year period. Our trajectory for unit profitability remains unchanged. And as noted, same-store average selling prices for aggregates advanced 5% in the quarter despite volume headwinds and certain mix headwinds. On a normalized basis, unit cash margins improved by about 7%, again despite difficult operating conditions at many plants. Our cost disciplines remained sound, and in the markets where we've seen meaningful freight-adjusted revenue growth, we've experienced greater than 60% flow-through to segment gross profit. In addition, certain transitory cost issues, such as our transition to new, more efficient ships, will be behind us by the end of the year. We remain on track with our long-term pricing and margin improvement expectations. Now I'll close with a few comments regarding our recent financing activity and our current financial position. Through a series of financing and refinancing actions since the beginning of 2016, we have been able to fund high quality growth capital investments while at the same time, moving closer toward our target debt structure. After paying down our 2018 maturities in July, our weighted average interest rate has dropped from 6.5% to 4.8%. The weighted average duration of our debt has extended from 7 years to 13 years. Annualized after-tax interest expense has grown by approximately $5 million. The rating agencies were supportive of our announced agreement to purchase Aggregates USA and the financing actions associated with that transaction. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade position throughout the cycle, and we should be in a position to pursue other smart growth opportunities as the recovery continues. Tom, back over to you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, John. Now despite the volume shortfall, and our revised outlook for the full year, I'm very encouraged by the way many key indicators improved during the quarter, and by what that foreshadows for the second half of 2017 into 2018 and beyond. This time last year, California and Virginia were relatively soft. Now they are demonstrating renewed momentum. Coastal Texas, although weak so far this year, should begin to deliver on a solid backlog of work as delayed projects kick off later this year. And we remain very confident about the Southeast, given continued growth in both public and private demand. Public transportation projects starts returned to positive territory. The pricing climate remains very positive. Our customers are confident, and our recent acquisitions have performed well so far. Now, speaking of acquisitions, I want to comment briefly on our progress related to the Aggregates USA acquisition, and also in general about the M&A market. Regarding Aggregates USA, we are on track with this important acquisition, and the more we learn the more excited we become. Their management team and workforce are outstanding, and the synergies are all there and work well for us. This transaction is the one that checks all the boxes. Operational synergies will include plant efficiencies due to balancing product mix. We will have cost synergies for managing our rail fleet more efficiently. We will serve new customers and serve our existing customers in different ways, with the right product at the right time and at the right place. We are also obviously \u2013 we obviously also have back-office synergy. And lastly, we realize that in any acquisition, we have great opportunities to learn from the new business and its people. We continue to evaluate a number of bolt-on M&A opportunities. The M&A environment is rich right now, but we will stay disciplined, and that means staying focused on the types of synergies that I just described. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Bob. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for all the color, Tom and John. I'd like to discuss the pricing environment today and what you feel about execution. So two questions. First, you provided a lot of color around your expectations for volumes in the second half of the year, and I was hoping you'd provide some color about the pricing environment in the second half of the year, and kind of how much confidence your customers have given what you were talking about as backlog and some increased activity in both public and private markets. So just to make it a little cleaner, what are your expectations for pricing, and what gives you confidence in your ability to realize better pricing momentum going into 2H? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'd describe the pricing environment right now kind of two words and that's vision and confidence. I think our customers see \u2013 they know the backlogs, the work they have, they see the work is coming. There's going to be a lot of pent-up demand. And so, it's a very good environment for pricing because of that. Now, I think that with some of the hard-to-produce products, asphalt sizes that are hard to produce and more expensive to produce, you may see prices go up faster and higher, particularly over the next year or two, particularly due to the rising highway demand and asphalt \u2013 demand on asphalt sizes. But people really understand the work that's out there, Bob, and they know it's coming. So, they have a lot of ability to increase prices, all the way through the construction materials group. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Bob, just to clarify on guidance, our expectation for full-year pricing remains unchanged, our expectation for full-year unit margin improvement remains unchanged. Very much on track, despite second-quarter weather impacts. Again, the work is there, everybody sees it, even have some places that are a little bit tight. And so our focus is really just on how much of our product we can get on the ground, how quickly, in the remainder of the year. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Got it. That makes sense. And John, could you send a moment and talk about trends in unit profitability? You obviously had some volume headwinds, but you've got really good price in the first half. It looks like you're getting pricing and volume in 2H. What should be our expectations for unit profitability? And is there room for improvement? Are you guys happy with current execution, given the environment? Thanks, and good luck. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We're happy with current execution. I'll let Tom comment given the environment, I mean, it can always be better, but we're happy. If I step back from that, I'd say our unit profitability and that continuous compounding improvement in pricing and the unit profitability, from our perspective, is very much intact and continuing. If I step back from it, just to give you a few numbers or summarize a few numbers for the Aggregates segment for the quarter, the headwinds we've faced, profitability and total profits were almost all weather-related and volume-related, tied to weather. The way we look at it, we probably lost 4.5 million tons of shipments in the quarter due to weather and related project delays, that's probably a $40 million impact to gross profit. In terms of price, and we call this out in our materials we had about $0.16 of headwind due to product mix and geographic mix. That's probably another $8 million to $10 million of gross profit in the ag segment in the quarter. And then in terms of cost reduction and Tom may comment on this further, we called out a couple of transitory effects, diesel and the cost of transitioning to our new ships; that was about $7.5 million of impact in the quarter. We probably had about a like impact, another $7.5 million roughly, from just operating in these wet, on-again, off-again operating conditions, and having a more difficult time leveraging fixed costs. So in total, the way we look at it, that's probably $60 million, $65 million of gross profit impact in the quarter largely due to volume and weather and selected project delays. I say all that because we expect to return to more normal profitability and growth moving forward, and I think you'll see that reflected in our guidance if you kind of work that through. So profitability trajectory largely intact, execution good. Really just a question of getting the product on the ground in the balance of the year. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, I'd add, John, I'd add to that, if you look step back and look at our operating people's performance in the quarter, they did a great job under tough circumstances \u2013 really tough circumstances. First of all, their safety performance was much improved. Our accidents went down 20%, reportable accidents, and our lost time accidents went down 35%. So a great job on that, they're really taking care of each other, and that's taking care of business. John said it best, when it comes to cost, the biggest impact was weather, and it was impact for the volume of weather and fixed-cost absorption. And then wet weather, as John said, you're starting and stopping plants, that's really inefficient, and it just slows you down. It's just harder to run sloppy material. And so we did the best we could with that, under the circumstances. And again, this is weather where it rains every other day, and that's just tough to work out of. And then we're also producing a higher percentage of asphalt sizes right now, and this is because of the visibility we have of all the highway work, and they're just smaller size, and they're just slower and harder to produce and more expensive to produce. But I think our ops teams continue to work hard to really work on their operating efficiencies, and it's obvious they're protecting each other, which is incredibly important. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sorry, just to recap that. So, your \u2013 you had great execution in the quarter, you have a positive outlook on both price and volume, and John, just to be specific on the record, you're expecting continued improvement in unit profitability in the second half of the year, correct? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes, the second half, and yes \u2013 and this is really what I'd underscore \u2013 yes, longer term, consistent with the longer-term goals we've laid out. So, yes. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Nice work in a tough environment. Good luck. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : We'll hear next from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Hi, good morning, Jerry. Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, this is Abdul Tambal on for Jerry. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Abdul. Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, firstly can you just talk about what needs to happen for volumes to be up in that high single-digit range over the balance of the year? And would you need favorable weather to get there? So which regions do you see at that high end of the volume range, and which regions do you expect to lag? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think, if you look at where we stand from a demand perspective, and what's happened in the markets and I'd \u2013 it's all really good. The one place it may be a little soft is non-highway infrastructure and I'll come \u2013 Illinois \u2013 but I'll come back to those. So I'll start in the Mid-Atlantic. If you look at Virginia, we saw \u2013 have seen non \u2013 our volumes actually went up in the second quarter, despite tough weather; non-res has come back, housing's been healthy, highway continues to be healthy, we have good backlogs there. Looking at Tennessee, Tennessee is a very healthy state and a little bit of a drag on highways, but that will fix, rectify itself with new funding, and the Tennessee DOT is trying to accelerate that spending, but it always takes a little time. Carolinas continue to be healthy, both public side and the private side and that's before we see flow-through of funding in South Carolina. Georgia, as we say, is a very, very healthy market on all ends, and we have massive highway work coming in Georgia, to the tune of \u2013 I could name six large jobs that we have secured that total 8 million tons of shipments. It's just a matter of when they ship. Florida, continues to be good, both on the public side and on the private highway side. Alabama has been a little slow, it's actually growing on the private side, public's a little slow. If you look at the coastal market, growing. Move to Texas, and we've called out coastal Texas and we'll see some big work flow through in coastal Texas, probably fourth quarter. We expected those to ship, both energy projects and highway projects, second quarter; they just got pushed back because of permitting on land, a number of issues. North Texas and Central Texas continue to be very healthy. We saw good growth in the second quarter in both of those. Arizona and New Mexico, while the private's been healthy, the highway work is really flowing through in those markets, and we'll get two pluses there because we're a big aggregates supplier and asphalt supplier, and our backlogs there are probably at records from highway work. California has been a great story for us in the second quarter. We saw the price really driven by the private side. Private non-res has really flowed through there. Housing continues to be healthy. We see a little bit of pick-up in highway work, and remember now, in California, we are the largest supplier of aggregates and the largest supplier of asphalt, and we're in all the metropolitan markets, and this is before SB 1 flows through. Illinois is a challenge. It's just going to be a challenge. The public side is tough. Believe it or not, we do see growth on res in Illinois, and we will see some bigger work that we have backlogged in Illinois flow through over the next 12 to 18 months. So if you just step back and look at the picture and get past the weather in the second quarter, this is a really, really good market. The starts have grown and the pre-construction pipeline is growing, both on the private side and now on the public side, and again, this is before we see flow-through of a lot of the new state highway funding. So as you step back and look at this, as I said in my opening remarks, we're very encouraged. Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And just ... John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: If I could sum up, we'd just underscore the work is there, the uptick in starts that we would need to see has already happened. In many cases, we simply need to have a reasonable or as-expected pace of shipment to jobs that have already started. That'll be what we keep an eye on, and we need to see our customers be able to catch up on some of the small deferred private work that was delayed out of the second quarter. But from a demand perspective, as Tom said, we don't need anything \u2013 I'm going to call it \"new\" to happen. The work is there. Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just on California, could you just talk a bit about what you're seeing there? Have you started seeing any of the emergency funding flowing through into the projects, and what are your expectations on when SB 1 can start to move the needle for your business there? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: There's you question. No, we've seen no flow-though. Remember, those funds don't start getting collected until November. Now, the state has been talked about as it's trying to accelerate that, they'll let 13 jobs this year, and then they're scheduled to let another 50 jobs, pending permitting and design. You'll see some work flow through, and a little bit flow through in 2018 maybe, and maybe some paving work or repair work, but the big work always takes 18 months to 24 months to really get going. So \u2013 and we just always, we want it to come through faster, there's a lot of promises to come through faster, but it's just tough to do. So I would tell you the earliest that'll be 2018, but it's really going to flow into 2019 and 2020 and beyond. So it's like I said, we're always disappointed it takes longer, but the work's coming and it is absolutely needed in that state. Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group, your line is open. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Thank you for taking my questions today. A follow-up on California ... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Kathryn. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Good morning. For California last quarter, you talked about how California looks a lot like Texas did four years ago, and I've appreciated the color you've given in the call about that state, particularly with the 10% increase in volumes. But taking it a step further, and knowing that you're the largest aggregate and asphalt producer, could you give us a sense, in terms of breaking out the state growth, just as you did for Texas, but focusing on the L.A. market versus Northern, and the San Diego market, in terms of what is driving real demand in the market, both on the res, non-res side? And also, helping us understand the rough breakout in revenues between L.A. and your other markets, and how depressed demand is, particularly, in the L.A. market? Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. First of all, the healthiest market in California right now is Southern California. And we're seeing \u2013 we've seen, in California, residential growth be healthy for a long time now, and it continues to grow. One of the big differences is non-res, particularly in Southern California, and as we saw in the preconstruction pipelines a year ago, and we talked about it's going to flow through, and it continues to build. So very exciting to Southern California on the private side. Northern California has been a little slower on the non-res. Res continues to be healthy, but the pipeline is growing, and it will flow through. As you remember, we had a lull in, or a dip in state funding a little better than a year ago with some budget issues, they came back and put some funds back in. And so we're starting to see that growth, and we know that they're trying to accelerate the funding. So I'd describe Southern California as a little ahead. Northern California, it will come, and is following and the preconstruction, pipeline is filling on both. Just, like I said, Southern is little bit faster. Now, as you saw in our numbers and you continue to see, with this visibility and the confidence and the jobs that are out there and what's coming, there is really good pricing momentum in California. We feel like, from a capacity standpoint, both in aggregates and in asphalt, we're physically in a great position, and ability to serve the market, we're in the best position. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : And could you just remind us, or break out \u2013 oh, go ahead. Go ahead, John. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I was going to just give you a rough breakdown, and this is very rough, it really depends on where you are kind of in the demand cycle a little bit, but our larger position is in Southern California, combination of L.A. and San Diego. You might think about that as roughly weighted two-thirds of our California presence. Northern California, Bay Area and up to Sacramento, the other third, including some of Central California. Those are very rough numbers. I'd also just remind you that our reserve positions longer-term in California, in a state that has many depleting reserves, are really fantastic and unique. So it's just a very attractive position now and longer term. Finally, we'd underscore that the recent improvement is really driven by private demand. Kathryn, as \u2013 I know you know this, because you look at it so well, but the public demand is still working through a bit of a lull that was caused by the Caltrans funding uncertainty for a while. We think that'll turn around pretty quickly with the new funding in place, but what you're seeing right now is really driven by healthy private demand. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I would add one thing on, this is not the market, but our operating folks in California have done \u2013 made big improvements in the last year on operating efficiencies and synergies, and I've got to give them a real hand of \u2013 or applaud them for what they've done, and I think that will continue and only get better. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Great. And just one follow-up on coastal Texas. As you know, we talk to a wide variety of different building contacts along the value chain, and we received a little bit better feedback than what you talked about in that coastal kind of Houston market, seen flattening and even some slight improvement in the Houston market. Could you help us understand the delta between what our industry relationships are telling us, versus what you're seeing? And is this more a function of project mix, or is there something else fundamentally that we need to keep in mind? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: No, I think, the fundamentals in Coastal Texas are all there. I know you've got employment growth, you've got population growth. We've seen the residential side come back. Non-res has been kind of flat but starting to improve. Our real issue has been timing of projects, and it's both highway projects and energy projects that we thought we had slated to start in the first half of 2017, and they're probably pushed to the fourth quarter of 2017. I'll give you some color on it, I'll give you some color. There's the Golden Pass LNG project and Sabine Pass, we thought would ship in 2017; it's actually got pushed back, it will not let until early 2018. Port of Freeport expansion has been pushed back by design, Chevron Phillips refinery upgrade was delayed. We saw State Highway 550, which is actually in the valley, we had environmental and permitting issues. And then the SH 288 Highway, which we thought would ship I guess second quarter, it got pushed back a little bit. So from our perspective, it's really timing of large work. I think that as I said earlier, the fundamentals are there, and I think that that is a market that is returning and getting a lot better, to your point. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. Final question, this is Texas. There you have a big letting with the state, $1.1 billion in August. What is your real capacity for the state itself to adequately meet the demand for that big of funding, particularly if you're going from $3.2 billion to $5.5 billion to $6 billion this year, and growing even more the following year, should we expect additional delays, just because of capacity constraints? Or is the state, and our contractors and yourself able to adequately even meet that demand in future years? Thank you very much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think that's one we'll have to wait and see. There will be some pressures on them, and tension there. We're hoping that they can get that all out and permitted and designed and in place, but as always with larger projects, it becomes \u2013 the time constraints could become more difficult. They are just more complex to design, you've got bigger permitting issues, you've got bigger right-of-way and land issues. So \u2013 and we're seeing that across all DOTs, particularly Texas, but you're starting to see a big increase of large projects. And the good news for us is, whether it's Texas or anyplace else, that's right in our wheelhouse. We've got a lot of those backlogged, but there's a high percentage of those that we're just seeing take longer from when they start. And we've got a number of them started in 2016 and we're still not shipping rock, and it's a variety of complex designs, it's right-of-ways, it's permitting; some of it's obviously weather in the second quarter. But I'm not \u2013 I guess, I'm not worried about this, because the work's there, it's funded and it is coming. Just large projects are more complex and take longer, but once they go, we ship a better mix of product, and they go fast. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Trey. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: I just want to follow up on that last comment. Tom, you mentioned with the increase of large projects, they are taking longer, and John, you also mentioned that the lag has extended some on the highway side. Just to get an idea, what \u2013 historically, what has been the lag there, and what is it now? So, we can kind of get an idea of, with starts picking obviously in the \u2013 on the highway side of things. I think you said Vulcan market is up 7%. Just to try to give us a sense for when those can flow through and how that lag has extended? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'd take a shot at it, Trey, just with the qualification that it's of course project-specific. These are often project-specific or state DOT specific circumstances. But historically at 12 months, 9 months to 12 months, and I think we've probably seen that on an average extend by 3-ish months. And again, it really varies by project, and again Tom gave you a sense, sometimes it's larger complex projects; sometimes it's design build efforts that get behind in the design phase, so they've started, but don't start taking aggregate shipments on the sort of previously agreed schedule. So we've probably seen, to bring it down to this year. we've seen kind of the turn in starts and turn in large public transportation demand happen about as expected, but we've seen the actual shipment of those projects be six weeks, eight weeks later than expected. And frankly, that's reflected in our revised outlook for the year. So \u2013 but again, it's highly \u2013 the only thing I would just sway is, this is also for the very large complex projects, it's also just a little bit less predictable. So, it's not just that we're getting it wrong, or it's not happening as quickly as we thought it was going to happen. It's not happening like the DOT thought it was going to happen, or the general contractor thought it was going to happen. It's just \u2013 I think a thing to keep in mind is, it's just that from a project-to-project basis, these large complex transportation projects, which are very good for us, the week-to-week, month-to-month shipping timing is just a little bit less predictable, and that's one of the things we tried to reflect in our revised guidance. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. All right. That all makes sense. And then also to kind of follow up on another question before, Tom, you named a lot of these projects, named off several that have been kind of pushed out a little bit that I think you guys had initially thought might come on a little earlier. Looking at that, what's your \u2013 what kind of visibility do you have, or I guess what's your sense for, as we sit here today, these projects that have been pushed a little bit, when those might come on? And I don't necessarily need project by project, but just a sense for your visibility there, and what's kind of embedded in the back half guidance for some of these delayed large projects? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Embedded in guidance, we've got a number of them that are starting to ship. We saw some ship a little bit in July, and they'll come on in August and September. And as I talked about Texas, we'll see some starting in the fourth quarter, I hope. But it is leveling out. I think we \u2013 and do not underestimate the impact of raining more than 50% of the time in May and June. It's not just DOT designs and right-of-way. When you have rain 15 days out of a month or 14 days out of a month, and it's spread out, the contractors just can't get on the job. And any day that we can cobble together four or five dry days, we see our shipments jump up all over the place. So the work's there, and it's going to come, but it \u2013 so I think that we feel good, and our outlook for the second quarter of the work that's going to start, we have good visibility to that and have good contact with the contractors. And the good news is, the work's there. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Right. Got it. All right. And then ... John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And Trey, despite all this, we'd also say by the way, we like seeing more large complex projects. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Oh, yeah. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: So the timing is a little bit more complicated, but we're one of the very best positioned suppliers to meet the kind of needs of those projects, and \u2013 so we actually like that trend. It does make the very near-term predictability of shipments a little more difficult. But these aren't things that are going anywhere, they're not getting \u2013 this is weeks of delay in putting aggregate on the ground. It's not changing whether or not they do the project. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Right. And then once they start, the visibility is there? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And once ... Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: So on ... John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, once they actually get going and past grading and that kind of stuff to taking our product, they go quickly. The other thing I would say is, we talked a lot about capacity constraints in the sector. This really isn't where the capacity constraint is, Trey. When you get going on these big jobs, if you will, you can get a lot of aggregate down per unit of labor. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. All right, that makes sense. Well, just speaking of labor, I will ask you this on the downstream, with looking at ready-mix drivers or pavers or that sort of thing, as we kind of look through any kind of spikes in volume and projects and things like that coming on, do your customers or do you have any concern about that end of things creating a bottleneck and maybe delaying things, maybe things wouldn't be quite as good as they would have been otherwise as a result of just not being able to find the labor? Just any opinion you have on that? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think from Vulcan's perspective, we're okay, and we continue to add, and we \u2013 both quality of employees and quantity of the employees. From our customers' perspective, and John said it very well a minute ago, on the large highway work, that's not going to be a big constraint. And those folks are really putting in on and prepared, because they have visibility to what's coming and they have time to do that, and that's going to continue to flow through. Now, there will be, on concrete work, probably more pressures, and I think those, our customers are working hard to address drivers and finishers and framers. But it will be a natural tension, probably a little more short-term than long-term, and it will come and go. But I think long term it won't be a bottleneck, it will be just be some tension. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I do think if we step back a little bit, Trey \u2013 and Tom, you might, I know you're talking to customers about this all the time, but if we looked at a year ago, our customers were pretty reluctant to make investments ahead of the election and things we talked about back then. It feels very different now, because our customers are talking about and actively trying to make those investments in their own capacity. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Well, they see what's coming and they've got bigger backlogs. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. That \u2013 got it on that, it makes sense. Last one's a housekeeping, so it will be quick, is just the $7.5 million you called out from the transition to ships, and I think it was the first couple of quarters here we've seen that. And you think it's going to maybe be a little bit going forward. How much do we need to be kind of modeling in or baking in to \u2013 for that? Which I'm sure is in your guidance, whatever it's going to be, but just to try to get a sense for pure aggregates? And then also, just what does the product mix in the backlog look like for the back half, as far as you can tell? Are you expecting any kind of impact at all from mix as we look into the back half of this year? Just so we're clear on how to model all these things? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. And obviously happy to follow up afterwards also, Trey, with you or anyone else. To answer your question on transition to ships, we expect that cost \u2013 and it was a little over $5 million in the quarter \u2013 I'd expect that to repeat again in the third quarter, and then ramp down in the fourth quarter as we get new ships delivered and get those online. But yes, incorporated in guidance. Diesel will be a little bit of headwind in the second half of the year, but not \u2013 it was about a $2 million headwind in the quarter, and should be about the same moving forward. And again, over time that should get reflected in pricing, and as we talked about before, higher diesel prices over time are in some ways a good thing for our business. So I think that's the answer on those tactical items; I'll let Tom comment on product mix. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, I would summarize product mix in the second half as probably normal. But you'll have two offsetting pressures. The new projects will take a higher percentage of fines and base, and that's really good for us. The flip side of that is you've got a lot asphalt backlog out there, with big highway work, and also non-res and the res will take lot of concrete work. So rising waters in both of the different sizes there, so I would tell you normalized. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Great. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And Trey, one of the things I know we talked about it in the past, just to revise, we talked \u2013 way back about a year ago, we talked a lot about rising repair and maintenance costs. And we feel pretty good about where we are in that now, they're basically flat or slightly down even in the quarter despite the other headwinds. So we do feel good that that period of rising R&M costs should largely be behind us, which is a good signal. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks a lot for answering the questions, guys, and good luck on the balance of the year. Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on that leading indicator you mentioned, the construction starts, you'd said that public highway was up 7%. Is that a year-to-date figure or is that for June? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Trailing 12 months as of June. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think that trailing 12 months figure's really the way you want to look at it on a \u2013 it can be noisy month-to-month, but I think the trailing 12-month figure is really the good leading indicator. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And it's not just that it's up, but that we've worked through a previous lull. And so it's returned to growth and is continuing to strengthen across our markets. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I would also add to that that, in a lot of places that's before the big funding flows through. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Oh, yeah. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: If you look at South Carolina or Tennessee or California, that \u2013 we haven't touch that, and so, more to come. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got you. Okay. And then as I'm listening to this call here, you sound incrementally positive, your commentary has been pretty bullish. As you think about your 2018 plan, I mean are you guys more incrementally positive on achieving those objectives, and how do you feel about timing, and \u2013 any thoughts there would be helpful? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think as John said, it really boils down in 2017 to the number of shipping days we have left that works there. And so whatever doesn't happen in 2017 is obviously not going to go away. We see growing how we starts, we see growing private starts, and the pipeline of preconstruction continues to fill. So while we feel good about the end of 2017, or the second half of 2017, I think we feel very good about 2018, 2019 and 2020, because like I said, the private side continues to be healthy and you've got very much a growing public side. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And I'd say, we're obviously not giving 2018 guidance right now, but as we sit here now, given the backlogs we see and the discussions we have with customers, and the public funding developments and all of the things we've talked about, I think we would be really surprised if we weren't entering 2018, we and our customers, with very strong backlogs and with a very positive outlook. And when you look at the start data, which is part of why we emphasized it in our materials, it would suggest we're returning to another wave of growth in this long recovery. It would suggest we're entering a period in many of our markets that have public and private clicking together in growth. A little bit analogous to where we stood in the second half of 2013, except that as we sit here right now, we've got substantially higher prices, substantially higher margin per ton, and a stronger balance sheet, and some key acquisitions coming online. So we're pretty excited about the outlook, as you can tell. And that's 2018 and beyond. But again, without trying to give guidance, we'd be really surprised if we weren't \u2013 we and our customers entering next year with strong and healthy backlogs and strong and healthy outlook. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then for long-term thinking here, I tend to think in upcycle, volumes will grow anywhere from 3% to 4%, perhaps 5% in the upcycle. And when you think about public and private clicking at the same time, is 5% a good long-term run rate, or you think, given where things are, where do you see them today, perhaps even better than that? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'll take a shot, based on \u2013 I'll comment on things we've said publicly elsewhere, just to be clear. But the demand is there to grow at faster rates. Just the pent-up demand is there to grow at a much faster rates. You could look at any of the end-use segments and you'd see it. And increasingly, the funding is there to grow at faster rates. That said, I think when you have a portfolio as broad as ours, across as many markets as we're in, and when eventually do have some realistic constraints, but how quickly DOTs get jobs out and how quickly the construction factor can meet that demand, 5% to 7% is probably a better assumption than 10% to 12%, just to give you a feel. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: The demand is there to grow at faster rates. There will be periods when we grow at faster rates, there are individual markets that you've seen that grow at faster rates. But across the whole portfolio and over a longer period of time, we still see a \u2013 a more gradual, steady, sustained extended recovery. But at the same time, I'd say you look at the demand picture and it's hard to argue why it couldn't grow more quickly. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: All of that still supports a good climate for pricing and a good climate for compounding profit improvement. And we still find very encouraging, particularly once we see the construction start activity on the public side continue to pick up. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Is it fair to say that your pricing is \u2013 has been moving above inflation for a while now, and is it fair to say, the cycle matures, you can continue to get that? Is that a realistic assumption? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think it's a function of what's happening out there in the market from a demand, and as I always say the visibility and confidence. And if you look at what goes on, particularly in the private sector, which is very healthy, continuing to grow and well below kind of normalized levels, and then as, again, you put on top of that what's happening from a highway perspective, yeah, prices \u2013 the pricing climb will be healthy for years to come. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got you, okay. And my last question, just on resi. I know resi has been good, everybody is talking about resi's good, Single Family is leading. How much of the Single Family is coming from new communities as opposed to in-fill, and if you could just maybe highlight some strengths and weaknesses by geography and what you're seeing in community development, if at all? And ... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think, if you step back and look at res in our markets, demand's up high single-digits. But Single Family is up much higher, it's up double-digit, and really the driver right now. And that growth is supported by subdivision development and construction, really with smaller homes and it's affecting a lot of first-time buyers and younger buyers. And if you look at demographics that's really good, because there's a lot of them out there. So \u2013 and the good news about that is, that kind of construction is very aggregate-intensive, both with new subdivisions and a lot of houses. So we're pleased with the res, and it is broad based across our footprint. It's hard to find a market that doesn't have good healthy residential growth. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Hi, thank you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Hey, Garik. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. First is a housekeeping question, just around your volume guidance for the second half of the year, the 5% to 10% increase. To be clear, does that include the acquisitions that you made in the first quarter? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. They don't have a big impact on volume, but yes. On aggregates volume, by the way they \u2013 a couple of our acquisitions are in our concrete and asphalt segment primarily. So the answer to that question is yes, but Garik I want to be clear the 5% to 10% is really August through December. The squeeze we're doing is really looking at our hand after July, seeing where we are. So I think if you did second half, it's probably equivalent of something like 4% to 8%. Just keeping in mind that July was up 2%. Stronger in the second half of July, but that's really what, as much as anything, is causing us to think about the squeeze for the balance of the year, is August through December. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And I don't want to harp too much on July, was most of the, I guess, the relative softness compared to the rest of the back-half guidance. Weather-driven again? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think July is easy to explain, the first two weeks it rained, the second two weeks we put a lot of work together. And the second two weeks were very healthy. So \u2013 and again, as we said, in lot of these cities we had 10 days of rain in July and still went up 2%. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And also (58:10) some continued weakness in Houston and Illinois were up 3%, and the trend is pretty good, but Garik, you know this very well, I think you looked at some of the squeeze in some of your work I thought it was well done, but it's just that number of fewer construction days we have left in the season. So anyway, that was \u2013 did I answer your question? Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks. And thanks for the kind words. My second question is on the highway outlook. You talked about an improving outlook here, but I'm just wondering, is there any risk or any chatter around the uncertainty on the federal side with respect to the debt ceiling and these continuing resolutions that we're under? Is that an impact, or I guess has that been an impact in the first half of the year? Is that a potential impact as you look as far as continued project timing delays in the second half of the year? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think the answer to that question is no, it's not an impact. The FAST Act's secure and we're seeing those funds flow through. It's been very good for us. I don't think a lot of it's hit yet. And remember, that passed in November of 2015, takes \u2013 again, it takes 18 to 24 months to flow through. But I think we're secure about that. I think what everybody's working on right now is what we do three or four years from now. And I think there's a lot of momentum in D.C. to address the Highway Trust Fund. Both parties want this to happen. It's not a matter, again you hear us say this a lot, it's not a matter of if, but when and how. We saw back in the summer 200 members of congress sign a letter to fix the trust fund. So I think it's going to be addressed, but I don't see any threats to federal funding at this point. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Garik, I do think \u2013 and I'll apologize for this being a little bit anecdotal, just as it relates to 2017. So, I think Tom summarized the forward outlook very well. But I think earlier this year, when there was a lot of talk about a $1 trillion infrastructure program very early in the year, we probably had some DOTs and some local governments, particularly some local governments, just kind of waiting and holding back on some starts, wondering if the rules were going to change. I think they're past that now, and in some ways this will be better for everybody if it was just quiet until we had an agreement on something. In the meantime, it's a distraction for everybody. But I think most of the DOTs, the people we're working with, are past that. And frankly, now that they've got new funding passed \u2013 and you know this in many states, they have a little bit of political pressure to show progress. And so that's part of why you see Tennessee and South Carolina and California doing what they can do to put forward some spending, just to show some progress. So in any event, I think it was maybe a little bit of a distraction for some DOTs early in the year. I think we felt that, a little bit right now, but I think we're past it. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Great, that's helpful. Thanks. Thanks again. Operator : We'll move next to Scott Schrier from Citi. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask a quick one on the downstream. Looks like you continue to have strong growth there, especially in concrete. Just wanted to see what you're seeing there in Texas and Virginia? On the concrete you had nice pricing, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. So I just wanted to see what some of the drivers there were, and how to think about it going forward? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Our volumes were up in all of our concrete markets. The big margin improvement came in Northern Virginia and Texas, California is \u2013 which is new to us \u2013 performed very well. We're very pleased with that. I think overall we're very pleased with our concrete performance, and I think that the teams out there have done a really good job of executing, both on servicing our customers and on being efficient from an operating cost perspective. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Because our biggest concrete market's still in Virginia, when you see that improvement, it's a little bit of an indicator of the strong private demand in Virginia, we talked about before, because that really drives more of the concrete usage for us there. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then on the comments regarding the strong shipment growth of 6% in Virginia-Carolinas-Tennessee, and I know that you had parsed out the overall volumes that you lost in the quarter due to mostly weather and some delays, is there any way to get a sense of what that 6% would have been ex the weather in those particular markets? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'll take a short at it. First, I would say it would have been higher. So you had \u2013 you did have weather impacts in South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia. So absolutely it would have been higher. I think, when we gave the estimate earlier of about 4.5 million tons lost to weather, in selected project laid in the quarter, that amount would have incorporated in what we would have seen as a hit in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Carolinas-Virginia-Tennessee. What I'd say is those markets would have been a bit better. They did have tough weather, if you look at the rain days across key markets in those states, but a little bit better working it through. And they also had \u2013 their weather impact was a little bit earlier in the quarter. What really hit Georgia and Florida in particular for us was tough weather in late May and June, when by definition you don't have time to catch up in the quarter. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thank you. I don't believe you touched on this, apologize if you did, but the SAG outlook for \u2013 still $320 million for the year, implies something around $9 million less in the second half than the first half. I guess I was a little surprised by that, just given maybe some coming costs to get Aggregates USA completed. Any more color there? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Our outlook for SAG is unchanged. You have some timing differences due to accruals and incentives and other things, quarter-to-quarter. Fundamental outlook for SAG unchanged. What I would say is that we remain intensively focused on G&A productivity, on the one hand, and we remained equally focused on making smart investments in our sales and customer service capabilities. So on the Yes component, if you will. But overall outlook for that for the year, unchanged. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And then maybe just from a bigger picture perspective, Illinois, not a new issue in terms of being a tough market, headlines are clearly out there. But I know you guys kind of think about the business for the long term, kind of just refresh your stance on the market, need for Vulcan to be there, maybe any green shoots you think you could develop over the next few years in that market? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think the \u2013 right now, IDOT is just in tough shape. The public sector's been hit hard, you've had no state budget for two years; the DOT stopped work temporarily in the second quarter, we've seen them crank it back up. From our perspective, we've got better backlogs than we've had. Our backlogs are growing in Illinois. We've got some big jobs that were delayed, particularly O'Hare runway. If you step back and look at Illinois and remember demand is driven by population, and Chicago is not going away and they'll have to fix their problems. And again, this is one of those that's not if they're going to fix it, but when they're going to fix it and how. So \u2013 and our position in Illinois is very good. I think under very difficult circumstances, our teams in Illinois have done a very good job maximizing profitability and being efficient and servicing customers. So while it's tough right now, we do think it's \u2013 in the long term, and remember this is a long-term business, that long term, it will be a solid market and we have the premier position in Chicago. So while it's tough, again it's a long-term business, and we're in for the long haul. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah. And Tom, with that position, are you guys \u2013 and in this environment \u2013 are you guys still able to get a little price in that market? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. We've had actually decent price increases in Illinois, and we've upped our game on servicing our customers, and position is important and we're getting paid for it. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Best of luck. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Just in terms of the year tasked in Illinois, we had obviously, we kind of would have expected it to have bottomed out by now. We didn't expect Illinois to be strong this year in terms of volume growth, but we didn't expect it to continue to drop like it has. So we foresaw some of the weakness, but we didn't see the kind of crisis around the budget, again, that Tom mentioned \u2013 and you may know this because it was publicized \u2013 frankly caused bills to stop being paid and caused work to stop. So we're still working through some of that in 2017. But again, it's a very healthy and profitable position long-term beyond 2017. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Stanley Elliott from Stifel, your line is open. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thank you, guys to fit me in. Most everything has been answered. Quick question though, on the Ag USA deal. In the release it mentioned the prospects of having to do some divestitures. Where are you all in that process? After looking at that portfolio, what percentage do you think you'll end up having to divest? Any thoughts around that would be great. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. To answer your question, we're still in the process with the DOJ, and that's a normal process and it's going along. But it's way too early to try to speculate on what we have to divest or where, what and when. But I would say this much, as we get into that project and into that acquisition and look at the quality of it, and as I said in my opening comments, we're really excited about it. This is a very good business, it has very strong assets, great positions, great reserves, and their people are very professional and very good. So we're \u2013 while we're going through the process, and as \u2013 which is normal \u2013 I think the more we spend time with this, the more excited we are about welcoming this into the Vulcan family. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And then you kind of, throughout the call, you've mentioned permitting problems being a culprit for a lot of the delays for some of these large projects. Certainly the administration had \u2013 was trying to push more streamlined regulatory reform. Is that impacting your business at all? What are the prospects for any changes on the regulatory front to kind of open up some of these bottlenecks, if you will? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Well, I think, as you know, we rescinded the Waters of the U.S., which was a big win. I'm sure there will be legal action with that, but, it was just the right thing to do. And right now the administration knows these issues with us \u2013 I mean, as I mentioned earlier, we had a big issue with our big Macon job which got held up with land and had some permitting issues, and we're now having a number of them in Texas. So it is a real issue. I mean, it's out there. Right now, the administration is gathering suggestions on what needs to be done to speed this up. So they know it's a problem, I think they're fact-finding right now, and I think we feel good that they're going to take some action on this, because it just needs to happen for \u2013 to rebuild our infrastructure, and to give people the ability to speed up these projects and get work done that needs to be done. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Do you think that has to be a part of like an executive action, or is this part of a larger infrastructure build? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think it may be both. I think you see some of both with that. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, guys. Thanks very much. And best of luck. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We've seen streamlining already in the FAST Act, I mean there is a lot of momentum behind this, it's just \u2013 and also, we'd also just say, keep in mind with these very large, complex projects, the larger more complex they are, the more opportunities there are for hold-up. You could have one right-of-way hold up a larger job. So again, it just makes a little bit less predictable, week-to-week, month-to-month, in terms of exactly when we're going to be shipping to the job. But ultimately, it's very good for us, because there are very few people who have the capabilities to service these kind of jobs, particularly in these markets. So good development for us long-term to see this higher proportion of large jobs in the mix. Frankly, you see it in non-res also. But short term can lead to some longer lags between start and actual shipment of aggregates. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I understand. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no callers in the queue. I'd like to turn conference back over to Mr. Hill for any additional or closing comments. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you for your time that you spent with us this morning. As you can tell, John and I, and I'd say the rest of our Vulcan family, are very excited about our business, our growing pipeline of work, our growing project starts, our backlogs are up, both on the private and the public side. And I think our people are working really hard every day to improve our business. So these are exciting times. We look forward to sharing more information with you over the quarter, and talking to you again at the end of third quarter. Again, thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. Operator : That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation.",

Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Operator : Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Elaine and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website, vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations homepage of the website. Please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. As you saw in our earnings release, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a major impact on Vulcan's operations and results and this occurred across a significant portion of our more profitable markets. Absent these hurricanes, our results would have been in line with the expectations set forth in our second quarter call. Adjusting for the extreme and prolonged bad weather, our daily shipments rates in our Aggregates segment, for example, were up at least 7% in August and September over August and September of last year. Looking ahead to 2018, we see the conditions in place for a continued gradual recovery in materials demand, for solid organic growth in our shipments and for return to the incremental flow-throughs and compounding unit margin improvements that have characterized our business for quite some time. I'll now share a bit more insight into the quarter and underlying trends and then John will touch on some preliminary perspectives as we look ahead to 2018. The quarter's extreme weather impacted our shipments and margins significantly, disrupting operations from Texas across the Southeast. This included shipments from our Calica quarry in Mexico. We estimate that the aggregates shipments were lower by at least 1.5 million tons during the quarter. In addition to the immediate impact of shipping days lost due to evacuations, storms and extended power outages, we and our customers have been working through the lingering effects of labor market disruptions, haul truck shortages and other logistical challenges. This has been in addition to the necessity of prioritizing debris removal and other recovery work. The storms also impacted our reporting pricing and margins, particularly in our Aggregates segment. Part of the effect can be attributed to geographic mix as we lost volume in several of our more profitable markets and operations. But we also experienced higher energy costs and lower labor and production efficiencies. And we experienced lower utilization rates of our ships and other distribution assets along with a series of storm-related repair costs. In certain cases, the impacts of the storms on our margins were exacerbated by the operating decisions we had made in anticipation of strong shipment growth. For example, we had recently added to our staffing levels at a number of facilities which then experienced significant shutdowns or drops in production versus plan. The storm's impacts have been far reaching. After Harvey, for example, our business in Phoenix experienced pressure on sales volumes due to a shortage of haul trucks. Drivers almost immediately had shifted to Houston to service FEMA's debris removal work. Although our plant operations did not suffer any lasting damage from the hurricanes, these were major events. And it will take some time for our business in coastal Texas and other Gulf Coast states, including all of Florida, to return to normal. Now we're back serving our customers across these markets, but we're shipping a different mix of material and generally a lower price/mix of material to different sorts of jobs than prior to the storms. In addition, we and our customers in these markets continue to face tight labor and logistical constraints. It is certainly possible that the recovery work associated with these storms will generate incremental demand for our materials over time. For example, a number of key legislative leaders in Texas are pressing for significant investment in flood control infrastructure. But for the balance of 2017, we don't expect to fully recover shipments lost in the third quarter. Certain markets, including coastal Texas, the Gulf Coast and Florida, continued to experience a drag on growth and unit profitability into the fourth quarter. As a result, we now expect full year aggregates shipments of 181 million tons and full year EBITDA of $1 billion. But the underlying trends and the very attractive fundamentals of our business remain unchanged. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, our daily shipment rates in August and September, adjusting for hurricane impacts, were consistent with the 5% to 10% balance of the year expectation discussed in our second quarter call. Public construction activity has disappointed in 2017 as state DOTs and contractors have struggled for a wide range of reasons to meet schedules. But given the shift to higher levels of legislated and dedicated transportation infrastructure funding, this would appear to be a temporary decline before an extended period of growth. From today's levels, demand has much further to recover and our shipments have much further to grow. The pricing climate also remains constructive, with pricing improvements consistent and widespread across the business. Trailing 12-month average selling prices have improved in 15 of our 19 general manager areas. Adjusted for mix and acquisition impacts, freight-adjusted average selling prices year-to-date have increased approximately 5% over the prior year. In terms of core profitability, on a same-store basis, while third quarter gross profit per ton was essentially flat, our cash gross profit per ton in our key legacy Aggregates segments was a third quarter record of $6.45 and that's despite the headwinds I've mentioned. In short, we remain well set up to convert incremental materials demand into incremental earnings and cash flow growth. And last but hardly least, as another indicator of the quality of our local performance, our safety results for the third quarter represented a new record for the company. Our 2017 MSHA/OSHA reportable injuries have dropped by a third compared to last year. Our MSHA incident rate is approximately half that of the industry rate. That's a world class achievement and a credit to our people who are focused on superior safety performance just as they are focused on superior operating performance every day. Now, I'll hand it over to John to cover some of our preliminary thinking about our positioning heading into 2018. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Tom. Before commenting on 2018, we'd like to clarify that our planning process for next year remains in its initial stages. Right now, we're frankly focused on finishing the current year strong. So we'll give guidance for 2018 during our next earnings call and not today. But we thought it would be helpful to share some early thoughts regarding how we currently see the stage being set for next year. Starting with the demand environment, we currently see mid-single-digit growth in 2018 over 2017. The recovery in private construction activity remains strong across the vast majority of our portfolio. And public construction demand appears to be firming up with most markets poised for low single-digit growth in 2018, a clear and positive contrast with the relative weakness experienced in 2016 and 2017. With respect to public construction, a key will remain the pace at which state DOTs and contractors can start and complete planned work and work deferred from 2017. Our backlogs and our order flows relative to public construction work, particularly highways, continue to build, suggesting some upside to the current outlook if delays experienced in 2017 don't repeat in 2018. And, certainly, we'd hope for some normalization of weather in 2018 leading to an effective gain in the number of available construction and materials shipment days. Breaking it down geographically, 2018 may be a year of haves and have-nots. The have-nots would include Illinois, Kentucky and Alabama. These states combined may see modest declines in demand due primarily to weak public spending. Opportunities for price gains in these states may also be limited. Our other states, the haves, would appear poised to see growth in both private and public demand, with private being the larger driver of 2018 shipment growth. Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida and California should all see demand continue to recover toward longer-term norms. And although further along in its recovery, we anticipate continued growth in Texas, driven by ongoing growth in private demand, along with several large highway projects recently booked. We expect the pricing climate to remain positive across these states also, although some may see a more moderate rate of expansion as individual markets adjust after multiple years of steady increases. Georgia, in particular, should benefit from a strong combination of public and private demand growth in 2018. California demand also looks poised to continue its recovery, with 2018 driven mostly by private work, with the benefits of new public funding coming late in the year and into 2019 and beyond. Given this visibility, California pricing for heavy materials should continue to improve at a healthy pace. From a cost and profitability perspective, certain of the headwinds experienced in 2017 should not repeat in 2018. Examples would include costs related to transitioning to our new ships, costs related to California floods and wildfires and, of course, the costs Tom referred to relating to the recent hurricanes. So, as Tom mentioned, the business should be well-positioned to convert even mid-single digit demand growth into solid organic growth in earnings and cash flows. And the business should also benefit moving forward from the capital allocation decisions we've made over the past few years. During 2017, we expect to reinvest approximately $300 million into core operating CapEx, consistent with our prior guidance. During 2016, we reinvested approximately $250 million. These investments improve the longer-term efficiency, capacity and flexibility of our production and support strong customer service. Having made these investments over the past few years, we expect the level of reinvestment per ton of production to moderate moving forward. Core operating CapEx in 2018 may be lower than in 2017. Our growth capital investments have also performed well. For example, acquisitions closed since the beginning of 2016 with a total consideration of approximately $245 million should contribute approximately $35 million to our EBITDA in 2018. To clarify, these figures do not include any impact from our announced transaction with Aggregates USA. With the close of the Aggregates USA transaction, we will have invested over $1.5 billion in long-term growth since 2013, while further strengthening our portfolio through divestitures and swaps. And while making these investments, we've maintained an investment grade credit position consistent with our stated goals, while extending the weighted average duration of our debt, lowering the weighted average interest rate and retaining excellent liquidity. We retain the flexibility to fund smart growth investments, internal and external, as we move forward. Tom, back over to you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, John. Let me continue briefly on the topic of capital allocation and specifically growth investments. As we all know, our industry has seen a good bit of M&A activity recently. The long-term growth prospects for heavy materials in the U.S. attract capital from around the world. At Vulcan, we continue to evaluate a number of M&A opportunities and we're also pursuing a target set of greenfield core investments and expansions to our distribution network. But, as you heard me say before, we're going to remain disciplined. We're going to stay focused on those assets for which we are the best owner. We're going to remain patient and disciplined when it comes to valuation and we're going to create and capture the synergies. Our planned acquisition of Aggregates USA fits our criteria for investment. The DOJ review continues to move forward as expected. As we noted when the transaction was announced, we anticipate divesting the Tennessee assets. We're hopeful that the transaction will close during the fourth quarter and we look forward to discussing this transaction in more detail once it is closed. Now, I'd like to close our prepared remarks with a quick look again at the fundamentals. After a quarter so disrupted by hurricanes, it may be helpful to step back and consider the dynamics of the business we're in and where we stand currently. In the trailing 12 months, we've shipped 180 million tons. Now prior to The Great Recession, you have to go back nearly 20 years to 1998 to find a year when our shipments were so low a level. And in the meantime, we've seen nearly 20 years of economic and population growth in our markets, where we've continued to grow strategically with an eye on the long game. So, obviously, we see big upside as demand returns to levels that are defined normal consumption patterns over multiple decades. And not only do we have the benefit of our 2017 asset base, we also have the benefit of our 2017 margin structure. Our gross profit per ton today is $4.78 versus $2.11 in 1998. That's about a 4.4% compounded annual improvement in unit profitability over that nearly 20-year period. These are strong fundamentals of our basic but essential construction aggregates franchise and they haven't changed. If anything they've strengthened, thus, our focus on organic growth and discipline and local execution and our focus on continuous compounding improvements to our customer service and our unit profitability. All of the fundamentals for strengthening demand are in place. Private construction in our markets remains strong. And while public construction has been a disappointment in 2017, the need and the demand is there. And the legislation and funding is in place and growing in many of our best markets. As we head into 2018, we have more visibility regarding that demand. And now, we'll be happy to answer any of your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question today from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Thank you. First question is just on the preliminary outlook for 2018 actually, just wondering on the cost side. Is it possible to quantify the costs that you believe will not repeat in 2018 and what that potential benefit might be? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Garik, it's John. I'll start, but I think right now, it's not \u2013 I think it's a little bit early to do that. We'll try to be maybe a little more clear when we gave official guidance in February. What I would say is we clearly did not see any reason that with a return to even moderate shipment growth we won't return to the 60% flow-throughs and continuous compounding improvement in unit margin that really characterize our aggregates franchise. So \u2013 and certainly there should be some opportunity for improvement. I think that goes without saying. But I think it'd be inappropriate a little bit early to try and quantify right now. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That's fair. Just wanted to - J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: To give total color on that. I think what we won't see is, as we said in the statements the impact of the ships \u2013 obviously we're not going to see the impact of the storms, which were very disruptive for us. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah, exactly. And my question I think was trying to address, if there was a dollar amount attached to the ships and the storms and the fires in California, but understand if it's a little bit early to provide specifics around that. I guess, secondly, is on the price/mix headwinds that you called out in the third quarter. Can you help us understand a little bit more how to think about that into the fourth quarter and then maybe even to 2018? How long you would anticipate some of those headwinds to persist on the pricing side? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think in a short period of time, any number of things could affect pricing. That could be product mix, geographic mix, timing of jobs and even the impact of two big storms. I think the key fact when it comes to pricing is that the fundamentals of pricing of aggregates hasn't changed and it's probably better now. You've got to remember as we always say that pricing is an ultra-local business and that local pricing is a campaign that compounds over time. If you look at the slides that we had for this call we've seen price increases every month for the past five years. On a trailing 12-month basis the price has gone up. And that's just a great example of that campaign. But to put a little color on it for you, let me contrast some markets. If you look at Georgia, which is one of our strongest markets both in the public side and the private side, even though volumes have been out a little bit, we saw \u2013 due to timing of jobs and the weather impact, we've seen pricing up double-digit in 2016 and double-digit in 2017. And you contrast that to coastal Texas, where we're further along in the cycle. In fact, we saw \u2013 a number of reasons over the last 18 months we saw business probably dip some there. We've seen high single-digit pricing every year for five years till 2017, saw it tail off a little bit in 2017, but believe that it will pick right back up in 2018. And then you contrast that to California, which is in the relatively early stages of recovery with the private side healthy, the public side has not come on, but coming on, we've seen \u2013 over the last two years, we've seen high single-digit range to low double-digit pricing. And we'll see very good pricing there in 2018. So, as we always say, remember that pricing is a \u2013 it's ultra-local. It's a campaign over time. And the proof of that is that slide where you see very month pricing improvement over five years. So I think, from our perspective, we're very confident that the fundamentals of pricing improvement are sound. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then my last question is just you called out California and Georgia both in the prepared remarks and just now as being strong markets. You also talked about labor constraints as impacting the level of volume growth in 2017. Just wondering if there is any risk that you could see with respect to labor in those two states as impacting demand into the next year. Or from that standpoint or from a timing standpoint, do you see relatively less risk in those states despite the growth outlook? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Garik, I'll start. On Georgia, we'll be coming off a year that had \u2013 it was very disappointing in Georgia on the public side and much of that work deferred into next year. So, assuming that some of the same extraneous events don't happen in 2018 that happened in 2017, storms, major interchange, burning down, those kind of things, I think, by the time we work it through off the lower base, we should be okay. The challenge I think in Georgia as we look at it \u2013 and I think the same is probably true for California at these levels \u2013 is less labor constraint, per se, and more about normalization of weather, a number of available days, and a little bit more just about the success the DOT and large contractors are going to have in getting scheduled work started and done. And labor is a part of that, but so is permitting, so is a variety of other things. And so that's what we'll be really keeping a close eye on in those two markets and the many others as we move between now and giving official guidance is what can we see on the public side that relates to work not just being funded, not just being scheduled, not just being slated, but actually moving dirt and taking shipments from us. And that's what we'll be keeping a close eye on. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We take our next question from Trey Grooms of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Trey. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: I guess my first one is on obviously the impact of the storms in the third quarter. And then you noted or I guess in the press release you noted that it's a lingering effect that you're seeing. I mean it's not surprising that that's impacting 4Q, but what's the expectation as far as how long that can kind of go on, this lingering effect that you call out? I mean you think most of it will be behind us in the 4Q or could that kind of inch its way into next year as well? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think let me talk a little about those effects for a minute. They're pretty hard to quantify, but I'll try to give you some color on it. We're still seeing some impact on shipments of product splits across a number of our markets and to give \u2013 really in the residential sector. So, we're just not shipping \u2013 or our customers, our ready-mix customers, aren't shipping like they were before the storm really to residential, some non-res, mainly residential. And I'm sure that's a mix of where the labor is and just getting back to normal. So some volume and some price impact there. Cost continues to be impacted. For example, we have the light load or split ships in the Houston, Beaumont today. We're waiting to dredge those two facilities from the storm. That dredging cost is going to be $2 million plus and we don't know when we're going to get them dredged just because there's that much pressure and demand to get everything dredged from the Gulf Coast. So while it's hard to quantify, we're still being impacted. I believe this will work out. I don't think it will drag much impact into 2018. I think it will be worked out in the next 60 days. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Trey, as I'm sure you and many others well know, while we are back shipping in many of these affected markets, we are not shipping the same product mix to do the same type of jobs. And so it will take a while. We think it will be mostly worked through in Q4. So we're back and operational but it's not like life is back to normal for the people who are displaced out of their homes in Houston, for example. The only thing I would say, Trey, just on guidance for the balance of the year. Those lingering effects are certainly one of the reasons that we reduced guidance. Obviously, third quarter results contributed. Q4 will be impacted. At least early October is impacted by Tropical Storm Nate. So, you take the lingering effects, you take Nate, you take the normal uncertainty around fourth quarter weather and those were all the things that kind of contributed to our lowering our guidance to the place we did. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And just \u2013 I don't know if you can give any color around this, but the guidance for volume that's implied in the 4Q kind of, I guess, low single-digit type volume. Can you take a stab at what might that have looked like excluding these things in the 4Q or the impact of these things in the 4Q? I mean you were able to kind of strip it out a little bit for August and September. Didn't know if there was any color you could give us on your - J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think it would be back toward the guidance we gave you in the second quarter and what we saw in the first couple weeks of August. And we were excited about that, saw some of the big jobs have been waiting on start-up. So, I think we'd have been within that second quarter guidance. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Which was - John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: So, Trey, that's for 5% to 10% up over the prior year. That's kind of what we see is the underlying momentum in those periods of time when you can get a clean look at it. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Got it. Okay. And then lastly for me, on the 2018 kind of outlook for the demand environment I just want to be sure. I understand mid-single-digit demand growth for aggregates. That's in your market specifically, if I understand right. Is that kind of the view there? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And then with you guys and the M&A that you've done \u2013 not talking about Aggregates USA, but the other M&A that you've already closed presumably you guys would \u2013 if for no other reason simply from the M&A standpoint you should outperform the overall end market at minimum because of that, right? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's it for me. I'll pass it on. Thanks a lot guys and good-bye. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We take our next question from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Jerry. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Hey, Jerry. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I'm wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing on the highway side. I guess overall it's our perception that activity levels in terms of capital actually getting spent this year was generally light despite very strong DOT budgets. And I'm just wondering what's your assessment on what's driving the delay in terms of appropriations translating into a meaningful pick-up in highway activity for your business. What do you expect that to look like in 2018? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. As you know, that's been a frustration for us in 2017 and one that we thought would have shift or would have flowed through the FAST Act some of the DOT funding would have flowed through earlier in 2017. Our miss in 2017 was the public work. The private side of the business was very strong, very good. It's up and will be up in 2018. If you look at the public side today, I think, our visibility is a lot better than it was a year ago. Our public backlogs are up considerably and our order flows are up and improving on public work. And we began shipping on a number of the large jobs that we had anticipated shipping much earlier in the year. So I believe and I know our visibility to public work for 2018 is much improved. I could give you a list of 10 major projects around the country, which we thought would have shipped second quarter, at least beginning of third quarter, but are now shipping. Three examples I'll give you would be I-85 widening in Charlotte, which is over 1 million tons. The much talked about 285/400 interchange in Atlanta is now shipping. That's a multi-million \u2013 that's 2 million ton job. And then we've also in the past talked about I-16 and 75 widening in Macon got delayed due to right-of-way issues and also some permitting issues. That's a 0.5 million ton done, which we now began shipping. So, with shipping all these jobs, our timing, our insight, our visibility of timing and the pace of shipping is much clearer than maybe what was six to 12 months ago. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And I'm wondering if you folks can comment on California specifically where we've heard some optimism that the SB 1 bill could translate into spending sooner than initially anticipated based on how tax revenue collection is going and the urgency to put capital in the ground. Based on what you're seeing when do you think you start to see the benefit of SB 1 in your business? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think California really is exciting place for us and, again, the private side is strong, been strong. Both non-res and res are very healthy there. And now we've got SB 1. Back in the summer, Caltrans announced $1 billion of accelerated funding. And then, in October, they announced the 90 fix-it-first transportation, or $3.4 billion of accelerated spending. And that second announcement includes 1,200 lane miles of pavement, replacing or repairing 66 bridges, and a number of like 300 culvert and drainage repairs or replacements. Most of that will come \u2013 you'll see a little bit of that probably in 2018, most will come 2019 and 2020. Obviously overlays will go faster but I think with all of this remember it takes normally two years to flow through. We've seen it in a number of bills. Now they'll get some of that accelerated and start shipping because there's a lot of public pressure to fix the roads in California. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: So, Jerry, just to help you with the math on that a little bit and others. As we look toward 2018, California shipment growth is still driven almost entirely by private growth in our current outlook. The efforts at Caltrans to pull projects forward are very good news, but pulling them forward doesn't mean we're shipping on them in early 2018. It means they're starting the work on the project. And so should benefit us maybe some late in the year. But it's not something that we have baked in for 2018, if you will. Back on California, stepping back just a little bit, we continue to think California looks a lot like Texas did four or five years ago. And as you heard Tom say and you heard me say, that's reflected in what should be a pretty darn constructive pricing climate, not only for our products, but for all heavy materials in California as we look toward next year. And it's really at that different stage of the cycle, so we're excited about it. But 2018 will still be largely private-oriented. Maybe with a little bit of upside if the public comes a little bit sooner but we think that's more 2019, 2020 and for many years beyond. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Phil Ng of Jefferies has our next question. Please go ahead. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : You called out project delays and logistical issues at the DOT last quarter. Have you seen any improvement on that front and any lift from FAST? It doesn't sound like there's much. And, separately, you're calling for a low single-digit growth in public spending next year. Is that generally in line with what you expected coming into the year? Thanks. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I'll kind of play back the story on expectations because again, I think, the theme is that in 2017 public has been the disappointment. At the beginning of 2017, we and others would have expected mid-single digit growth in public demand. What we have seen in 2017 and probably will have seen by the end of the year is mid-single digit decline in demand. So, as Tom said, that's where the miss is. The important thing is as we look to 2018 we actually see firming up and a return to growth in public spending and public demand across really all of our footprint, with the exceptions that I noted of Alabama, Kentucky, and Illinois. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Got you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And that's very good for the overall health of our business. We don't have in that mid-single digit growth outlook for next year, which again preliminary. We'll revise it between now and when we give official guidance. As you noted, that's not predicated on a huge jump in public spending. That's predicated on stabilized, low-mid, low-single-digit growth in public spending. So if people are able to get projects out the door more quickly, when that begins to accelerate, there could be a little bit of upside to that. But we don't see it happening certainly in the first half of 2018 yet. Something we'll keep a close eye on. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think back to our earlier comments is the visibility of the jobs that we've got started and that we know we're going to ship. And the ones that we haven't, we don't know yet. We just don't know the timing of them. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Got you. And then I guess just one last one. I mean coming into the year, there's certainly a lot of euphoria with this administration pushing through an infrastructure bill. But just given some of the delays in \u2013 whether it's healthcare, tax reform, has that lack of clarity in D.C. led to any delays in projects and funding getting pushed out? Thanks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: No, it hasn't. And as we said before, this is something this country needs, and it's not a matter of if, but when. But in the meantime, we've got very good business. The private side has been growing, will continue to grow. We're starting to see the highway work flow through finally, and we're starting to see the FAST Act funding flow through. So when that comes, we'll welcome it with open arms, but in the meantime, I think, demand on both the private and the public side is helping. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group has our next question. Please go ahead. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. I just want to first focus on gross margins. Could you walk through the puts and takes on the quarters? Really trying to get a better sense of what more is one-time versus the ongoing managed cost, particularly as related to storms. And I know you talked about it in the prepared commentary, but if you could put it around \u2013 some metrics that we can better understand for modeling purposes. Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think just some color on that. Those storms were really disruptive. We've talked about it. From an operating perspective, you've got to remember. We had \u2013 operations were shut down days, even weeks. For example, the West Coast of Florida, our operations over there were shut down two or three weeks. Some of Georgia operations were shut down a week. And when you're down for that long, the costs don't go away. I mean we paid our folks during the evacuation just because it was the right thing to do. But those costs kept building up. So, anything specific we talk about is going to be conservative. I think that we're slowly getting back to normal on that. We'll work that through over the next couple of months, but that's really hard to quantify. John? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Kathryn, I'll try and give a little bit more quantification and color, but let me first say to everybody it's just inherently very difficult to quantify precisely because the nature of the impacts were so widespread and on so many aspects of the operations. But to try and give you a rough feel the way we look at it. You saw us note that we think we lost at least 1.5 million tons of production deferred, of shipments deferred. Just on the increment given where those are coming from, the nature of it, we think that's probably a $15 million to $20 million hit to EBITDA in the quarter. But then let me go to the profitability of our Aggregates segments and to your point about margins. We think the hit there was probably of a equal and maybe larger size than just the straight volume loss. And this is a function of changes in product mix, changes in production efficiency, again in some cases having fully staff facilities where we kept everybody on the payroll that had no production for a couple weeks, which is very much the right thing to do, freight and logistics costs, unique spikes in diesel, unique spikes in freight costs, which in some cases we ate because we chose not to pass through to customers in the middle of a crisis, repair costs, lower fixed cost absorption, the spike in diesel and its usage in our facilities that you've seen, et cetera, et cetera. So, on the cost side, we'd estimate that's another $15 million to $20 million. But that's an estimate in the quarter. When I say cost, I really mean profitability. Absent that effect, we probably would have grown unit margins, unit gross profit in our Ag segment another 5% to 8% quarter-over-quarter. Then if we go to our non-ag segments, probably about a $7 million to $8 million impact, particularly in our asphalt segment, particularly in San Antonio, which was hit hard economically. So that, I hope, gives you a feel, Kathryn. I just would underscore that it's more difficult than the average one or two items to quantify just because of the very nature of how disruptive this was. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Absolutely understand and I think you've seen us write about that too. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : The other thing \u2013 and it's extremely helpful in terms of that quantification. In terms of the optics for pricing in the quarter and once again this may be difficult to quantify, but when you look at your 3% pricing, what \u2013 any impact to that? Did the storms have effect to the optics of pricing understanding that you're shipping more base and fines versus clean stone into the affected markets? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think that it was definitely impacted. We just called out mix being about 1%, but that's \u2013 on the surface there was for price, other impacts with the storm that aren't seen there. And, again, we were very careful with our pricing, just because it was the wrong time to raise prices during when people are hurt and in trouble. So that probably had some drag on us also. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. Perfect. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Kathryn, we can cover this offline if you wanted. But if you looked at our non-freight adjusted pricing, just total revenue per unit in ags, it was up probably 5% or 6% Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Yeah. Saw that - John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Relative to our freight adjusted pricing up 3%. And, again, a lot of that was in a lot of these disruptive markets where we had kind of a spike in freight related cost, like an immediate spike that wasn't passed through the way it normally would be. So, there's also a little bit of cost and price impact there in some of these markets that's transitory. I think we'd probably say the overall pricing climate and trend \u2013 and, again, you know very well how variable it is by market. It's incredibly variable by market, but total, total across the portfolio tracking between 4% and 5%. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Perfect. Yeah. No, definitely understand that, and just really wanted to get a better understanding of that mix impact from the storm, so - John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Helpful. And then finally - John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And that mix impact \u2013 a question was asked earlier, that mix impact is not over. We'll still see some of that in Q4. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. And final question and I promise to get off the storm train. Just when you look at your recovery in Texas and Florida, we've gotten mixed feedbacks from a wide variety of different construction value-chain participants, be it ready-mix truck drivers to building project distributor in terms of the pace of recovery in each of the respective markets. But maybe could you frame a little bit more \u2013 are you seeing a fast recovery or a slow recovery you thought in Florida and in Texas, because that will help us? We think that the lingering effect could go beyond Q4 and so this is kind of what we were trying to get some comfort around. Thank you very much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think it's actually \u2013 I would tell you pretty slow, and it's dragging. I think that every day we get a little better with this. Labor markets get a little more normalized, debris gets picked up, and you start to have trucks available. Homebuilders and the thing that concerns us is probably the res side and when we start \u2013 when our ready \u2013 when our customers in the ready-mix business start shipping to residential. And I'm sure that there's no question there's labor constraints there with repairs and rebuilds to homes as well as new construction. So we're hoping that we get past this in 60 days, but you may be right there. We don't know. And I think like I said the biggest concern is what happens to shipments to res and the timing of that. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And in some markets - Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Thank you very much. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Like Florida, asphalt paving is not really picked back up either. So, Kath, I think, it's fair to say that just to underscore that that there's certainly a degree of uncertainty. I'm not sure anybody knows. It's just a little bit the nature of what these communities are working out of. It's not about our quarry operations, but it can sometimes be about our customers operations. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Thanks very much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I swear to God I'm not going to ask a single question about the hurricane, okay. Enough of hurricane. Let's move into 2018, all right. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: All right. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So, a lot of detail, forward-looking. I'm kind of feeling like we're 180 million shipment tons for this year and last year. I'm kind of understanding if there's pent-up demand and you're talking like mid-single-digit volume growth next year, that kind of gets me to 190 million tons. You've got some nice M&A that closes I guess end of 4Q, first quarter of 2018, maybe a couple million tons, maybe 5 million tons. Just for thinking and I'm not asking for an estimate or a crystal ball, is like 190 million to 200 million tons like a good conceptual starting point for 2018 given all of the issues we had this year with weather and hurricanes and all that stuff? And some of the comments you made about kind of widespread recovery except John's point there's three states which are kind of struggling. Is that the right way from a bookend perspective, big picture? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think, first of all, we're still working through that and we're still working on the plan. Some of that, as John said earlier, will depend on what happens with the public sector, how fast it goes, do some of those bottlenecks get cleared up? I think as far as the mid-single digit, we're very comfortable with that based on the projects we've seen start and the ones that we know and the timing of the ones that we know are going to go. A lot better than we were a year ago. But I think we're still working through that and trying to get out of the hurricane and into normal business. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And, Bob, we don't want to slide in to giving a number or giving guidance before we give guidance too much. I think I'll come back to private demand climate. It's still quite strong in Vulcan markets. By the way, if somebody wants to ask that includes non-res and non-res backlogs in our markets, certainly through 2018, res very strong across the entire footprint, public transportation, public highway work, strong across \u2013 well, not strong \u2013 strengthening after a period of lull and what we think is the beginning of a long wave of growth on the public transportation side. The public \u2013 what we call public other infrastructure, water, sewer, some other things \u2013 not as strong and conspicuously weak throughout this entire recovery. But that's now 10% of our business, when it would normally be 15%. So it's not the big thing. So we absolutely see return to at least moderate growth with some upside. And I'd underscore that we haven't seen anything change in our view regarding our ability to convert that growth into good growth in operating earnings and cash flows. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. I mean you guys have had a couple years where you've been growing volumes 15 million or 20 million tons. So I mean there is no question about your ability to leverage yourself when the demand returns. Maybe we could talk for a second about gross profit per ton. And obviously this year has had some disruption, which has weighed on that and impacted incremental margin performance. How do you feel what's \u2013 like, where can you take this, Tom, in terms if we get normalized demand patterns, what kind of gross margin per ton can we start looking for on a dollar basis? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: You'll hear us talk about the flow-throughs of 60% and that's what we'd tell you over time. Nothing has changed with that. We have confidence in that. I think we won't see some of the cost headwinds that we saw this year. John talked about those with the ships, some of the fuel spikes and obviously the cost of the storms and the destruction of the storms. So I think back to our normal flow-through. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So you feel good about continued improvement in profitability. Final question and pass it on. Am I right to detect a subtle shift in your capital allocation strategy? Because you guys spoke more and focused more on it during your prepared remarks. Is there any kind of tilt to how you're putting money back to work? And how should we be thinking about that for next year, 2018? Thanks and good luck. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good question, Bob. John. I don't think there is any change in strategy. In fact, it's very consistent with what we've been on for a long time. We did just want to note that on \u2013 we're still very focused on a free cash flow generation, and we think we should have accelerating free cash flow generation over time. As you hear Tom say all the time, we're going to stay disciplined on our deployment of capital back into M&A and other growth with an underscore of discipline. But we do think that we've caught up on some amount of our, I'm going to call it, core maintenance and operating CapEx investments. We've made some very good investments there. And we'll talk about this more when we give guidance next year, but we'd expect our core maintenance operating CapEx number to maybe even next year be down a little bit despite production being up a little bit. We think that number will kind of moderate, but no change to our long-term outlook or certainly no change to the capital allocation disciplines we've been following for some time. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So you're saying EBITDA grows potentially but CapEx goes lower, so free cash flow strengthens, correct? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's awesome. Good luck. Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis has our next question. Please go ahead. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: I wanted to ask first \u2013 you said mid-single digit volume growth expected for next year. Could pricing also be up mid-single digits or those three states you mentioned, does that drag down the average a bit? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think as you look at it, we're not there. We actually couldn't give you guidance, because we're still doing the work. But what I would repeat is that the environment for price increases is very healthy. We've got population growth. We've got employment growth. Our customers are growing their pricing and everybody recognizes that our business \u2013 we need to add to the profitability of it. So the environment is good. People see work out ahead of them. The visibility is very good, so they can take a risk on price all the way through the construction business, not just aggregates. So, while we won't put a number on that at this point, I'd tell you that the environment is good for price increases. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that, Tom. And as a follow up I'm just curious. What's your view on the M&A landscape in 2018? Do you see a moderation of the large deals and maybe just a few comments on your priorities for M&A? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Those deals will come and go, and you never can predict them. I mean we're working on a number of M&A opportunities as we speak, and they'll be all shapes and sizes, and you just can't predict that. When someone gets ready to sell, they're available. As always, I think, we're focused on the discipline about what markets we want to be in, what synergies do we have and are unique to us, and how we put them to work. Obviously, you've got to be disciplined on what you're willing to pay for an acquisition. And then as important as anything, once you get it, you have to be disciplined about integrating it and making it profitable as fast as you can and make it a part of the Vulcan franchise and part of the Vulcan family as fast as you can. So, we're busy with that. There is deals working right now, but to predict size and number for 2018, really tough to do. I can tell you right now that the M&A part of our business is very busy. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Scott Schrier of Citi. Please go ahead. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to talk specifically about Virginia a little bit. You continue to have a lot of strength and the right mix and I just want to see what you're seeing in the state both on the public and private side, whether you think that's going to continue and how you look at the pricing environment there? And I guess as a follow-up to the last question, how you'd view the M&A environment in the state of Virginia? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Virginia is strong. I think if we talk to you \u2013 in 2016, our weakness in Virginia was non-res. We predicted it coming back. It has come back. That has really added to our growth in ready-mix in Virginia. Res continues to be healthy and the public side is healthy. So really good market both from demand perspective and also from a pricing environment, both in all the way through the construction materials mix. I think aggregates prices have gone up for Virginia and will go up healthy in 2018 and we continue to see ready-mix prices and unit profitability grow in Virginia. It's a good market for us. And I think our folks are doing a really good job there. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And I wanted to touch real quick on the SAG expense. It looks pretty low. Just wanted to see if there is anything there and how you're looking at progress in SAG as we head into 2018. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Say, if I'll start on SAG, I don't know that we'd say it's low. We're never \u2013 we're always looking at it. It's an area of continued focus for us, both in leveraging at the sales going forward as we've talked about a good bit but also in terms of making sure SAG dollars are deployed against those things that better serve our customers, better serve our people and just drive productivity and performance over time. So, it's something we are intensively focused on here. We'd read it as good discipline, good focus in line, but I wouldn't say that our job in SAG is anywhere near done. We're going to continue to focus on it. We're making investments on the sales side, the S part of SAG, particularly to serve our customers better and to grow with the small private work we see and to make sure we participate in that part of the growth in the market fully and to do so at a full value for our products. And we're continuing to be very efficient on all of, what I'll call, the support function aspects of SAG. So, good result in the quarter, but an ongoing area of focus. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. Before I ask question, one just on clarification, so far as the Ag USA deal expecting to close kind of fourth quarter. I apologize if you have said it, but the level of divestiture that you were contemplating or discussing, all of that is kind of within that framework, meaning, just increasing the likelihood of getting that closed by year-end. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: We can't say a lot about Ag USA. The DOJ process continues to move forward as expected. We believe we'll close it in the \u2013 we believe we'll close Ag USA in the fourth quarter. Divestitures will be a part of that. We're also working really hard \u2013 and this is most important to us, pre-closing integration and what we can do to make sure we execute on the integration of that business. It is a very good business. We're excited about it. It's great assets in really good markets with really good market positions. They have really talented people and we're ready to get them on board with Vulcan. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And, Stan, just given the way you asked the question. We said when we announced that we didn't expect to be able to keep all the assets in Tennessee and we still don't expect to be able to keep all the assets in Tennessee. So no change really. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No. It sounds like it's moving according to plan. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And I guess lastly you talked a little bit about some of the internal investments and then some of the new site developments. Is it easier to greenfield a quarry or to kind of work within on an organic basis in that regard? Has anything changed on that or is it just kind of more opportunistic kind of something you guys have been doing for a while? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks for the question. We are doing greenfields and M&A. Greenfields are very important part of our business. It is part of our strategic planning, something where we execute on and have been executing on over the last couple years. We have a number of greenfields working \u2013 quarries working right now and a even bigger number of distribution greenfield sites that we're working on or are finished. We don't talk a lot about those because of the strategy and the confidentiality of that but it is absolutely part of our business and a very important part of our strategy. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Stan, I think it's fair to say that it's harder not easier. And when we talk about things that are coming to fruition, almost without exception, they've been in the works for a decade. So, just keep that in mind if we're making announcement in 2018 about greenfield development that they've been in the works for a very long time. It is very hard to do. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, guys. Thanks and best of luck. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you for your time this morning. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We are excited about the growth opportunities we see ahead of us and we look forward to sharing that with you in our next call, another topic. So, again thank you for your time. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I would like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Sandbrook : Thanks, John. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our call. 2017 was another exciting and opportunistic year for U.S. Concrete, filled with record-breaking milestones in many facets of our business. We reached new highs in volumes, revenue and profit, driven by solid growth both organically and through acquisitions. For the full year, total revenue of $1.3 billion, it was up 14% over prior year with adjusted EBITDA of $192 million, up 20% over prior year driven by double-digit growth in both ready mix volumes, which ended the year at 9 million yards and aggregate volumes, which ended the year at 6.2 million tons. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to leverage our market strength and operational efficiencies, which were evidenced by our sixth straight year of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. We are particularly proud of our performance in light of significant weather headwinds in every quarter of the year within our various regions. Once again, during the fourth quarter of 2017, results in the Northeast and Texas markets were significantly impacted by weather. In the last two weeks of the year alone, we estimate we lost approximately 100,000 yards of concrete sales, which would have generated an estimated $12 million of incremental revenue and $2 million of incremental EBITDA for the quarter. For the quarter, our expense compared to prior year quarter was $5 million higher as we incurred additional self-insurance costs for workers compensation and auto liability. The increased expense was a result of adverse claim development during the year and we would not expect this type of run rate to continue into the future. A significant driver of these results was our relatively recent expansion of operations in New York and California, which have higher costs of claims relative to our operations in the parts of the countries. In November, we completed the largest acquisition in the company's history with the addition of Polaris Materials, an acquisition that will open the door for additional growth in the West Coast and change the landscape of our existing Northern California operations. Building on the momentum we created over the last several years, we also continued to expand our footprint into new markets like Philadelphia and Southern California and bolstered our positions in existing markets, both geographically and through differentiated product offerings, including our non-union acquisitions in Northern California and New York. With our continued vertical integration expansion through the acquisitions of Polaris Materials and Corvette Materials, we now have the capacity to supply over 40% of our internal aggregate needs out of our own quarries and pits. We remain relentless in our focus on operating excellence and the integration and synergistic growth from these acquired businesses. We saw a lot of positive movement out of Washington during 2017. The passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will generate meaningful additional cash flow for domestic businesses. And U.S. Concrete will certainly be a recipient of those benefits as a full taxpayer. We look forward to reinvesting this additional liquidity into our business to build on our momentum and provide significant value for our shareholders. The passage of tax reform will also generate confidence among consumers and employers and should have a major impact on the construction industry and the sectors we serve. The administration also recently announced the framework for its infrastructure modernization plan that would allocate $200 billion in federal funds to spur at least $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments with partners at the state, local and private level. As part of the plan the permitting process and regulatory barriers are being streamlined, shortened or eliminated. Although, infrastructure activity represented 17% of the fourth quarter revenue, opportunity for additional expansion driven by the FAST Act, state and local initiatives, and momentum from the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the distinct possibility of increased incremental federal infrastructure spending in the coming years. Construction industry forecast and leading indicators are showing strong signs for continued growth across the country and specifically in our markets. The Architectural Billings Index projects growth in each of its sectors and ended the year with project inquiries increasing three consecutive months across the nation. Total construction spend in December was at its highest point for the month in over 15 years with year-over-year growth in both residential and non-residential sectors. Construction employment continues to rise in response to increased demand. The U.S. Chamber of Congress Commercial Construction Index increased once again in the fourth quarter showing continued strength in overall backlog levels, new business opportunities and revenue forecast with a reported 99% of contractors feeling confident in the demand for new commercial construction over the next 12 months. Residential construction markets remains strong with a 50% increase year-over-year in the building permits in 2017. Dallas-Fort Worth, Manhattan and Washington D.C. all remain at the top 10 cities for new apartment constructions during 2017 with Dallas and New York ranking number one and number two in the nation. We feel confident that the nation and specifically our markets had a solid runway for continued growth over the next two to three years with an extended steady recovery that it supported by fundamental growth and gross domestic product, employment gains and industry and consumer confidence. I'll now take you through each of our markets. In Northern California, which represented 26% of our revenue this quarter, we were able to continue the positive momentum after enduring record rainfall in the first quarter of 2017 in the Bay Area. There are many high-profile projects and a wide variety of construction going across the entire area. We continue to strategically differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Recently, our operations in Northern California successfully placed 8,000 yards of ready-mixed concrete in less than 12 hours for a 23-storey office tower that achieved LEED Gold certification in Oakland. Projects of this size and complexity demand product specificity, quality control and service requirements that we believe few can provide. One of the most exciting projects to come to this area will be a huge waterfront project in conjunction with the San Francisco Giants baseball stadium. This project is one of many that represent San Francisco\u2019s dedication to providing affordable and appropriate housing that support continued population growth. In Dallas-Fort Worth which represented 24% of our revenue this quarter significant rainfall and abnormally low temperatures plagued the region in December, hindering what began the quarter with an opportunity to accelerate sales in response to weather deferrals from prior quarters. Due to the deferral of the construction pipeline in the Dallas-Fort Worth area remains very strong with continued growth of population and expected increased investments in commercial and residential construction. A great accomplishment in our DFW market was the successful placement of what has been coined as the mega slab at GM's new Arlington, Texas assembly plant. Our business unit covered over 256,000 square feet with 6,500 cubic yards of ready-mixed concrete. This historical placement included 650 truckloads, delivering continuously for over 30 hours. I want to congratulate our team on the safe and successful completion of this complicated project. In New York City, which represented 22% of our revenue in this quarter, we experienced a substantial increase in public projects during 2017, led by most notably, one of our projects LaGuardia Airport. This vibrant area boasts a variety of building projects across all sectors. And one of the most exciting on their horizon is the master plan industrial park at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which includes five million square feet of new construction. Job growth is expected to continue throughout 2018, which will continue to drive commercial and residential construction in this vibrant region. Our West Texas region, which comprised of 10% of our fourth quarter revenue, continues to be a steady contributor. The rural strategy that we have implemented in our West Texas market with self-supplied aggregates provides consistent performance and profitability from loyal customers in the region. We continue to see a significant increase of rig count in the Permian basin showing great promise for this dynamic region. Our Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia operations remain an important growth area for our business. The addition of our greenfield plant in Northern Virginia this year is proven to be a prudent investment with the surrounding construction activity. The Washington, D.C. market is also seeing continued success with a groundbreaking of the district's largest construction project ever. The Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge is a replacement of the original 1950 bridge and a major investment in the infrastructure around burgeoning area of the district. Overall, the economic fundamentals across our markets are very positive and with the recently passed tax reform and precursor to protect potential infrastructure build, we are optimistic about the overall economic and construction industry. Our ready-mixed concrete backlog continues to increase and as of December 31, 2017 was approximately 7.9 million cubic yards, up 7.6% from the same time last year. Now I want to discuss the 2017 acquisitions on our current deal pipeline. In 2017, we made good progress on executing on our core strategy of increasing our share of internally-generated aggregate EBITDA. In spring, we purchased Corbett materials, a natural sand producer in South Jersey to primarily supply a portion of our sand needs to our New York ready-mix operations by water. In November, we closed on the acquisition of Polaris Materials on Vancouver Island to internet supply our own Bay operations as well as shipping aggregates in the markets in Southern California and Hawaii. This addition filled the critical void in our integrated operational portfolio as a rapidly depleting California aggregate reserves while ultimately lead to elevated aggregate pricing levels. Additionally, the Long Beach terminal extended our operational footprint in the Southern California for the first time. The integration of Polaris into U.S. Concrete has moved quickly and its ahead of our own internal plan. We're rapidly moving forward to increase capacity at the existing operations while simultaneously accelerating the plants future development of additional reserves, which were acquired as part of the Polaris transaction. Back on the ready-mix side, as previously stated, 2017 saw us acquire additional operations in Texas and California, as well as placing a stake in the ground of Philadelphia for the first time. These operations also have been integrated into their respective U.S. Concrete regional structures and will be great contributors in 2018. Our deal pipeline in both additional aggregate and ready mix opportunities remains full in all regions as we enter 2018. I'm optimistic that we will continue our deal pace at our historical levels. And 2018 growth will continue through both organic and acquisition related opportunities. Now I'd like to turn the call to John to discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail. John Kunz : Thanks, Bill. I would like to start by saying that we're very happy to announce that we have completed the remediation of our material weaknesses related to internal controls covering our tax accounting. We put a comprehensive remediation plan in place early in the year. And after completing the 2017 year end review of our internal control environment, along with our auditors, Ernst & Young we concluded at our internal control environment including controls over tax accounting are effective. Now that we have that behind us, let's move on to our results for the quarter. Not withstanding adverse weather and increased insurance cost, we are very pleased with the underlying operational metric that drove the fourth quarter results, which were highlighted by 28th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $341 million and adjusted EBITDA was $44 million. Average selling price for ready-mixed concrete and aggregate products increased 1.3% and 9.2%, respectively, compared to the prior year quarter. We estimate the incremental weather in the last few weeks of the year resulted in the deferral of approximately 100,000 yards of concrete sales in Texas and the Northeast. For our ready-mix business, our raw material margin percent improved to 49.4% from 49.2% in the prior year quarter. And on a dollar per cubic yard basis, our raw material margin dollars increased to $66.24 from $65.12 in the prior year quarter. In addition, as Bill mentioned earlier on the call, we recorded a $5 million increase in incremental self-insurance expense when compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. I want to point out that the $5 million was not added back to our adjusted numbers. The expense related to \u2013 the insurance expense related to adverse claim development during the year and we would not expect this type of run rate to continue into the future. We estimate the impact of weather-related deferrals and insurance costs resulted in approximately 190 basis point reduction to our adjusted EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter. SG&A was 9.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 9% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted SG&A, excluding stock compensation, acquisition-related professional fees and other transition cost was 7.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 8.5% in the prior year quarter. Our net loss attributable to U.S. Concrete was $3.1 million in the 2017 fourth quarter or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjusted net income from continuing operations was $8.2 million, $0.50 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, compared to $0.82 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was calculated using a normalized tax rate of 40%. This normalized tax amount is consistent with being a full cash taxpayer in 2017. For the full year, income from continuing operations was $26.3 million compared to $9.6 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $192.3 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year of $159.8 million. The year was a huge success given the significant weather-related hurdles we had to overcome regionally in every quarter of the year. Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated $10.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities as compared to $23.6 million in the prior year quarter. We generated $3 million of adjusted free cash flow as compared to $17.6 million in the prior year quarter. The decline is primarily attributed to additional interest and taxes that were paid in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. As a result of the recent 2017 Tax Act, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 28%. We spent approximately $8.7 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily to purchase plant machinery and equipment in support of growing demand in our markets compared to approximately $9.4 million for the same period last year. As of December 31, 2017, the book value of our long-term debt including current maturities was $693.3 million. This included $610 million of senior unsecured notes due 2024, $9 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility and approximately $85 million of other debt consisting mainly of equipment financing for our new mixer trucks and mobile equipment less than $11 million of debt issuance cost. As of December 31, 2017, we had total liquidity of $229 million, including $23 million of cash and cash equivalent and $206 million of availability under our revolver. Our availability is net of $20 million for outstanding letters of credit and other required reserves. At December 31, 2017, our net debt to the last 12 months total adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.5x. With this, we ended the year with a healthy balance sheet and adequate liquidity that support our ongoing operations and near term acquisition strategy. I will now turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Sandbrook : All right, thanks, John. We're pleased to continue to deliver on our growth objectives and create a sustainable platform for continued success. We continue to believe that the construction cycle has a healthy runway for continued expansion. The policies that have been put in place over the last 12 months, including the 2017 Tax Act and a potential acceleration in U.S. GDP and the potential for an effective monetization program that will increase funding and remove regulatory boundaries, all support positive outlook for growth over the next two to three years. As we look to the balance of 2018, we are optimistic on the prospects for growth in our existing markets and our acquisition pipeline remains a viable avenue for additional growth, including potential new metropolitan market areas and increased vertical integration with additional aggregates. We expect our markets to continue to outpace the national average for construction spending, allowing us to maintain our relentless focus on our two-pronged strategy to first grow organically through operating excellence and superior product delivery and service and second expanded through acquisitions that bolster our existing market positions and capitalize the potential opportunities in new high-growth markets. We expect that the disciplined execution of our strategic growth plan should lead to increased value for our shareholders. Thank you for your interest in U.S. Concrete. We look forward to updating you on our future successes. We would now like to turn the call back over to the operator for the question-and-answer session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is open. Blake Hirschman : Good morning, guys. It\u2019s actually Blake Hirschman on here for Trey. First question, understanding on the volumes, there was some referral due to weather earlier, in the year I think you said, 200,000 yards last quarter and then updated that to 100,000 yards this quarter. Obviously, it takes time especially in the winter to kind of work through this. Just trying to think about the timing and when that might flow through kind of any update on any color you might have there. Bill Sandbrook : Yes. Thank you. As we said on the call, there has been deferred volumes throughout the course of the entire year because we have normally wet weather toward the end of the year in Texas and New York. But throughout the year, the first quarter was all California and the middle of the year was Texas. And like we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s Texas and New York towards the end of the year. It all depends on cooperative weather patterns and the availability of our contractors labor force to be able to work on jobs simultaneously. In the event that there is still significant contraction in available labor, all of those jobs have to be worked off sequentially as well as capacity constraints at our plants and with our own driver delivery professionals. So it's going to be worked off through the year as the weather cooperates. You can see our backlog at the end of the year is that historical high at the end of the year period over the course of last number of years. And we're optimistic that that will be worked off as weather cooperates. Blake Hirschman : Okay, got it. And then as a follow-up on that. On the backlogs, is there any way you can kind of decipher or take a guess at what acquisitions might have added to that? Or is that kind of too tough to tell? Bill Sandbrook : No, the acquisitions on \u2013 for the 2017 acquisitions that we haven't lapped yet were fairly small. If you remember, the Philadelphia operation with action supply and harbor and A1 are fairly small acquisitions. As well as some of those are in segments that are more directed towards smaller and residential type opportunities, specifically in the Bay area, which wouldn't work off large construction project backlogs in their normal book of work. So I would say its de minimis on acquired backlog at least in this period. In other periods, you're absolutely right. When we buy something like Ferrara or Nicanor [ph] agenda, we did inherit a very large backlog. But in the 2017 period, the acquisitions were for different purposes. Blake Hirschman : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then last one from me, switching gears to the Polaris acquisition commentary sounds good. You kind of mentioned, it was a heavier plan and talked about accelerating future reserves there. Kind of with all the moving pieces just was curious if you could give us some 2018 guidepost may be around volumes or expected revenues, EBITDA, anything along those lines would be helpful. Thanks and good luck. Bill Sandbrook : Yes, you\u2019re welcome. Obviously, we don't provide that level of detail in our existing operations. And what we've guided to in the past is there was very recent Polaris under previous ownership guidance they used to provide. I would say that that would be a baseline and I'm optimistic from there. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Your line is open. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning, guys. Bill Sandbrook : Hey, Adam. Adam Thalhimer : Bill, what are your thoughts on organic ready-mix volumes in 2018? Bill Sandbrook : Organic? I would say mid-single digits. We're optimistic in all of our markets that we have a healthy backlog that gives us some visibility to substantiate that belief. And I fully think that in expanding GDP, which I think we're all going to start facing with the fulfillment of the tax reform is going to substantiate that as well. So I would say mid-single-digit organic volume growth. Adam Thalhimer : Perfect. And then, curious about the bidding activity in your main markets and maybe I can get to even rank them, just in terms of kind of how robust the bidding pipeline is. Bill Sandbrook : I would rank them as of one, one, one and one. All four of our major regions have ample opportunity right now. And we're still in the part of the cycle where we can be selective in the projects that we go after, which provide us the largest opportunity for outside margins in each of our respective operating regions. So Adam, it's really difficult to rank them. They are all very robust at this point. Adam Thalhimer : And then in New York, are we still talking about this phenomenon where you might see some activity shift out of Manhattan into the Boroughs? Bill Sandbrook : Yes, I don't think it's necessarily a phenomenon. I think it's basic economics 101. It exists in San Francisco, it exists in New York, where the price of midtown condominiums, apartments or any other type of housing is so astronomically expensive that people are having to shift to lower-cost areas, but still want proximity where they short commute into those cities, which means Oakland in San Francisco and it means that West Shore of the Hudson River in the Northeast. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. And then, lastly, I'm curious what do you think your ready-mix EBITDA margin would have been in Q4 without those deferred volumes? Bill Sandbrook : So without the deferred volumes? John Kunz : Yes, without the deferred volumes probably adjusting for 100,000 yards that we spoke about, I would say, it's around $2 million that would translate into an adjusted EBITDA. So when you take that and if you add back the self-insurance cost that we had, there might be about $7 million add back to normalize where we would have expected it to be. Adam Thalhimer : Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Brent Thielman : All right, thank you, good morning. Bill, I know you don't guide, I know it's a little early in this quarter, but just kind of given all the noise of 2017 and even in the last quarter there. Can you just talk qualitatively about how things have started to progress this year so far? Bill Sandbrook : Well, Brent, the number one determinant in this part of the year and first quarter is always weather. So that's a combination of cold and snow in the North and rain in the South or rain in California. So I would say, if you would watch what's going on specifically in each of those regions, it will give you directionally where us and other situated companies that are dependent on outdoor activities are coming out in the first quarter. And you also have to remember that it ramps up January, February much slower than March. So even if there are some weather headwinds earlier in the quarter that a very weather-friendly March can trump some pickups in weather in the first two months. Brent Thielman : Okay. And then, maybe Bill, can you talk about maybe how you're thinking about managing through some of the inflationary pressures developing out there? Not necessarily on the cement side, but things like labor and diesel, I guess, to name a few. How do you think about deposit on those arising costs as you move through 2018? Bill Sandbrook : That's a very good question, Brent. As far as the cost of diesel, the cost of diesel now is up $0.30 some in the quarter year-over-year. And we are in the process of reinstituting our traditional fuel surcharges indexed at a lower diesel value than we previously would have at the last time in the cycle when there was inflationary diesel cost expansion. And that would be just a transparent pass through, not a markup, but just to recover our cost on a like-for-like basis. And that is starting to be instituted now across the footprint and will be messaged to customers here going forward. As far as labor, normal labor, and there are inflationary aspects especially where there is driver shortages in Dallas is well-documented that driver wages are increasing faster than the normal inflation rate, which is being reflected in higher prices. And it's not that difficult to pass through. Obviously, pricing is always competitive. But our customers are facing the same thing with their labor. So they are very well aware of the fact that there is inflationary pressures that has to be passed through the entire value chain into the ultimate end-user. We're very focused on these inflationary periods. Traditionally, in times of raw material inflation outside of the ones that we just spoke about it's a very good time and a very fertile time for ready-mix companies to raise pricing, recapture what their additional costs are and in fact, able to expand our margins. So we're not \u2013 we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to be able to continue that dynamic. And would rather face this than a deflationary environment. Brent Thielman : Okay, Bill, that's really helpful. And I guess, from that standpoint all things equal from a geographic perspective. I know things can swing around but that mid-single-digit kind of price growth assumption for ready-mix still kind of appropriate for the year? Bill Sandbrook : I would say that's appropriate, mid-single, yes. Brent Thielman : Okay, and then just lastly how much of the 9% increase in aggregate price is the inclusion of Polaris and I guess, secondarily would you expect that business or price into that business to grow faster than the corporate average this year? Bill Sandbrook : I would say a large part of the price increase is Polaris coming in at higher price point. And as far as the pricing dynamics across the portfolio, I think there are a significant inflationary pressures on raw materials, especially aggregates in California because of their increasing shortage value. Everybody has to think about Polaris as the California quarry basically. The dynamics that go along with California quarries on the commercial side would be definitely in play for that asset. And as California aggregate pricing and inflationary pressures creep in, we will obviously be able to partake in that. Brent Thielman : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Craig Bibb of CJS Securities. Your line is open. Craig Bibb : Hi, guys. It sounded like you had wet and cold New York and Dallas, which would push the mix towards San Francisco, but your price is only up 1% year-over-year. What are the factors worth play? Bill Sandbrook : That is right Craig, there has been some mixed impacts on this. Now California, pricing and San Francisco pricing is historically high, but New York is even higher. And so when we\u2019ve shifted volumes out of New York, our volumes in New York quarter-over-quarter were down almost 4%, I believe. And as that shifted it is a fairly good weather California, it wasn't one for one swap. So there is a mixed shifts in this overall pricing. Craig Bibb : And nothing competitively changed at ready-mix? Bill Sandbrook : Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say that there is any difference in the competitive landscape in any of our buckets, especially with new entrants or with the new behaviors from existing competitors that have been there over the last two, three or four years. I don't see any major competitive landscape shifting. Craig Bibb : And I realized you guys do not provide guidance. If I take mid-single-digit organic volume growth and kind of mid-single digit price, I don't know that I can get to the consensus EBIDTA number, which is like almost 30% above where we were in 2017. So what am I missing or what has to happen so that we can get to that level of growth? John Kunz : Let me answer the first part of your question that you are going to have to ask the other people to make up the consensus since we don't give guidance. As far as what you might be missing, I don't know what you have in front of you. Remember we are shifting the portfolio a little bit more towards the aggregate EBITDA side, which is at a higher margin. And we have high expectations for our recent aggregate acquisitions. Craig Bibb : Okay, and so that actually bleeds right into my next question. You haven't provided a lot of detail on the Polaris acquisition other than pointing to their EBITDA guidance prior to the acquisition. And obviously I think everyone understands that as you increase volume, there is a lot of leverage and that EBITDA margins will snap back well above where they were historically. But it isn't clear how quickly that will play out. So over two years it's a lay up to get to the type of EBITDA margins they were talking about pre-deal, but how does that play out kind of over 2018? Bill Sandbrook : I fully expect to realize what their guidance was over a two-year period. And as I' said in my prepared remarks, we're ahead of our own plan. So I expect at least partial realization of a two-year synergized plan of somewhat earlier than that. Craig Bibb : Okay, is there anything that we should be concerned about or sticking points that might cause things to go slower or no surprises? Bill Sandbrook : Not competitively, not regulatorally. It's only going to be weather, Craig. Because all the other pieces are in place, backlogs are in place, price, forward pricing is in place, the demand is there. It's just the ability to get those projects out of the ground through whether or if labor gets tighter and our downstream customers are more labor constrained, so their cadence of project completion is slowed. Those are the type of things that I'll be looking at. Craig Bibb : And then the last one. On the $5 million, I think it's workers comp increased. I'm assuming that some type of catch up but you explained that it was worker comp claims are higher in New York and California. So it sounds like maybe that number should be somewhat higher going forward? Bill Sandbrook : What it really related to was the adverse development of a few claims. So what we referred to it as is our self insurance cost and we had some adverse development during the year, which sort of got us by surprise, we do an annual actuarial review with one or two through the year and look at it actuarially and to make sure that our numbers are correct and it sort of \u2013 the number sort of caught us by surprise when we did that evaluation and we had a post catch up to our accrual and that's really what it relates to. Craig Bibb : But the ongoing accrual will be \u2013 won\u2019t change? Bill Sandbrook : That accrual as it sits right now is right around $19 million. I don't expect that number to change much. But what we're trying to point out is that we certainly don't expect that type of incremental cost on a run rate going forward. We just \u2013 we believe that's an abnormally high charge or high cost to incur in any given quarter. We will incur workers comp cost as we have in each and auto cost as we\u2019ve incurred in each of the past few quarters. We just don't expect the type of run rate. I mean, when you look at the year-over-year comparison we are $5 million higher than what we were in the fourth quarter of 2016. Craig Bibb : Yeah, so I understood that but was wondering if the annual accrual should be $5 million higher. So we are $1 million or $2 million per quarter higher going forward. John Kunz : So as we grow and as what Bill was referring to, as we grow in California and New York, you will see increased expenses associated with that, because it's really tied to correlation in the hours worked. So we will see some increase. I don't have a number to give you an exact number because it depends on a lot different factors associated with it. But again, the $5 million is just what we thought was a very high number. Craig Bibb : Okay, yeah, That makes sense. Congratulations on the great year 20% EBITDA growth against all that weather that's fantastic. Bill Sandbrook : Well thanks Craig, appreciate that. Operator : The next is from Scott Schrier with Citi. Your line is open. Scott Schrier : Hi, good morning, I wanted to follow-up on the previous question about inflation, your comments on the fuel surcharges. Considering that we have seen material spread margin has been decelerating a little bit over the year. If you really want to push through these fuel surcharges and I could imagine we're getting some of those volumes back, is it fair to say that we should expect more of a normalized operating leverage in ready-mix in 2018 or based on some of those factors should we expect it to trend possibly a little bit lower than what we consider normalized. Bill Sandbrook : I would go with a normalized thesis. As we recapture some of the inflationary pressure in specifically in our fuels, that will be additive. But the deceleration that you reflected on, we ended last year's fourth quarter on a material margin spread of 49.2%, we are at 49.4% now we actually and then expanded that in the first quarter of this year from 49.2% to 49.6%. So there can't be an expansionary aspect of this because we ended the year higher than we did in the previous year. And any time you get material margins up close to 50%, I mean those are world-class numbers. So I would dispute the fact that these are decelerating. In fact, the dollar-on-dollar total material margin has expanded significantly through the last number of quarters. But to your point, I would expect a normalized run rate on these margins and costs. Scott Schrier : Got it. And then on aggregates on the volume growth, I'm just curious if you could parsed it out a little bit. I mean I know up north we had the bad weather. Is most of that growth due to Polaris? Or if you could talk about how much you have seen out of Corbett in the quarter also that would be helpful? Bill Sandbrook : A lot of that is Polaris because you have to remember, in the Northeast, where we did have somewhat of a slow or weather impacted December. That would have affected our internally supplied aggregates as well. And our external aggregate sales would be affected in a similar fashion. But there is some noise here on the like-for-likes because of Polaris. But I would say most of the growth in fourth quarter was as a result of that, about 80% most. Scott Schrier : Great, thanks. And last one, can you just talk about how you're thinking about leverage and you\u2019re speaking earlier about a robust acquisition pipeline in all the opportunities. So if could you talk about how you're balancing leverage with your inorganic growth strategy that would be helpful? Thanks. John Kunz : Sure. As I mentioned earlier, we're about 3.5x leveraged and we're cognizant of that. What we look for with respect to our leverage ratio is on a long-term basis, we would anticipate to be in the mid-2s or somewhere around that range. One of the most important factors with respect to our acquisition strategy is making sure we have sufficient liquidity to whether any potential downturn. And as I mentioned, we have over $200 million of liquidity as of year-end. So there is certainly some room for us to use the liquidity for acquisitions here in Q1. And as we generate cash we can certainly, reinvest that in the business and buy potential targets going forward. But any Bay acquisition we would reevaluate our balance sheet as far as where we are potentially raise capital. Does that answer your question? Scott Schrier : Yes, great. Thank you very much and good luck. John Kunz : Thanks Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rohit Seth of SunTrust. Your line is open. Rohit Seth : Hey, thanks for taking my question. My first question is on tax reform and the impact on your tax rate. Can you provide any color on that? Bill Sandbrook : Sure. I mean if you look at where we were before, we called out a normalized rate of around 40%. So the rate, the statutory rate dropped by about 14. But when it dropped by 14, we lost the Section 199 manufacturing deduction. So when you drop from 35 to 21, that's a 40% reduction. So that would have taken us from 40 down to around 26. But the 199 manufacturing deduction is covered around 3% or so benefit that we lost. So that's how we get from 40 into that 26% to 28% range. Rohit Seth : Okay. And then, a few quarters ago, we talked about incremental margins in like the mid-20s. And given there is a lot of weather headwinds in 2017 might be some inefficiencies, you guys had labor but no revenue offset. I mean, is that incremental 25 still a good run rate in 2018? Bill Sandbrook : I would say that, that is exactly what we should be. Seth, when you hit the nail on the head. When you have these operations especially in New York that are heavily unionized and you are weather impacted, you have a lot of inefficient utilization labor. And we actually had the same dynamic in our Dallas market, specifically the last two weeks of the month of December, which aren't robust weeks to begin with but we are complete bust this year, which impacted these costs and the incremental margins significantly. But you are spot-on with where normalized is. Rohit Seth : Okay. And then, just on Polaris, you provided a lot of color, thank you for that. Is there any over \u2013 immediate overhead synergies that we could use? I know you've disclosed some pro forma financials not too long ago, but it would certainly help for modeling on the quarterly basis particularly. Bill Sandbrook : We are in the process of taking overheads out of that business, have accomplished some of that during the first part of this year already. As far as dimensioning it, we haven't dimensioned the entire operational aspects of that business. So I'm hesitant to put any color around that other than what I said earlier to Craig is that we \u2013 if you look at a two-year post run rate synergized EBITDA, we're pulling some of that back into 2018 because of some of these overhead reductions as well as expanded sales opportunities. Rohit Seth : Got you, all right. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill Sandbrook : Okay, thanks Seth. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Your line is open. Stanley Elliott : Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Quick question, when you are thinking about the material margin and on a go-forward basis. Is there anything either with admixtures our fly ash or anything like that would be a headwind? Or should we think that's going to be additive to material margins going forward? Bill Sandbrook : Hi Stanley, I think it's going to be additive. We have undergone extensive negotiations with our admixture suppliers over the last quarter are making some minor tweaks in there that are very advantageous to us. And we look at the \u2013 we look a little bit deeper than just the pure cost of the admixtures. The partnership we have with our admixture suppliers to help us to actually obtain higher margin businesses and upsell the aspects of the admixtures they provide us. It is just as important as getting across down to admixtures side. So we can get it on the revenue side and the cost side on the admixtures. As far as the fly ash side, actually last year, our usage was up year-over-year. We expect that to continue. Although, long-term, there are some supply concerns as more and more coal-fired electric generating plants are being phased out for cheaper natural gas and other renewable sources. So long-term, I do have some concerns about fly ash availability but in the short-term I don't see any headwinds. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. And then I think you had mentioned that you guys are 40% internally sourced on the aggregate side. What's the ultimate goal, once we start layering in Polaris? Are you guys 80% internally sourced? Or any numbers or even directionally would be very helpful. Bill Sandbrook : You might have misunderstood. It would be when Polaris is fully synergized into our operating footprints in the Bay area that will be at 40%. We\u2019d like \u2013 we continue to want to take that higher. North of 50% would be where we would want to be over time. The trick on the aggregates is, you are well aware is the cost of large deposits when we're trading where we are and those deals are trading up in the teens, they are somewhat difficult to actually the trigger on, so they have to be a very, very critical to our current, our future operating footprint. And deals like Polaris, as I said, were aggregates are becoming more and more scarce in California, they are absolutely worth the investment. In more rural areas of the U.S., where we don't operate, I'm not interested in. So there is only a select number that are even of interest to us. But I'd continue to look at our footprints, our potential new footprints and any aggregate reserves around them they would be fair game for us to get north of 50%. Stanley Elliott : And then kind of back on M&A piece with the Polaris in toe, does that help you looking at markets, either in Northern California or in the Southern California, in terms of what we're able to do from a synergized kind of all-in number given the vertical integration potential there? Bill Sandbrook : It certainly does. I mean, anywhere you can reach aggregates \u2013 excuse me, anywhere you can supply aggregates by water into a ready-mix market, either on the costal areas or through inland shipping channels with minimum amount of double handling, those are all candidates for future growth regions for U.S. Concrete, which puts the entire West Coast in play at this point. Stanley Elliott : Great, guys. Thanks and best of luck. Bill Sandbrook : Okay, thank you Stanley. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Bill Sandbrook for closing remarks. Bill Sandbrook : Thank you. Latoya. And thank you, everyone, for participating in the call this morning and for your continued support of U.S. Concrete. This concludes our call. And we will look forward to discussing our first quarter 2018 results with you in the future. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, this concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all of you for joining our call today. Our first quarter operating performance represents a really strong start to the year. Results were in line with our internal first quarter plans despite challenging weather and higher than expected diesel costs. Leading indicators for construction activity in Vulcan-served markets are very encouraging. Recent price increases have been well executed and we expect materials pricing to improve further throughout the year. We're also putting recent cost headwinds behind us. For ton margins in our Aggregates segment improved year-over-year and we expect stronger gains over the balance of the year. We are reiterating our full-year projections for net earnings and EBITDA. When the sun shines, we're shipping strong, although bad weather in January and February drove our total shipments for the quarter slightly below expectations. With more normal weather in March, our same-store shipping pace was up 7% over last year. And April was even better. This gives us great confidence in our full-year volume guidance. Pricing momentum remained strong. When adjusted for geographic and product mix, freight-adjusted aggregates pricing improved 3% compared to last year's first quarter. Many of our price increases took effect April 1. This is consistent with our plans. On a same-store basis, our first quarter cash gross profit per ton and our core Aggregates segment improved 4% versus the prior year. This record result was accomplished despite several challenges including a continued drag from rising diesel prices and the planned shutdown of several large facilities to get them ready for a robust construction season. I'm proud of the performance of our local operations' leaders. Gross profit from our concrete segment was flat compared to the prior year and gross profit from our asphalt segment declined from the prior year due to the impact of winter weather and due to margin compression from higher liquid AC cost. Now, these costs haven't been fully passed into the market yet. The decline also included the short-term negative impact of construction paving business that we acquired in February of last year. Despite the seasonal drag from our downstream operations, we still delivered $168 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. This was driven by improving unit margins in our core aggregates business. We feel very good about our readiness for the construction season. We finished the first quarter strong. This was a good start to the year that sets us up well for the second quarter and the rest of the year. Ultimately, I like the trends we're seeing. The leading indicators we monitor support our full-year outlook. Private demand continues to recover across most of our footprint. Residential growth continues. We see a growing pipeline of large, private, nonresidential projects and our markets continue to enjoy strong backlogs consistent with 2018 expectations. We're also seeing renewed development of industrial projects along the Gulf Coast. While we don't expect to shift significant volumes to these projects this year, it bodes well for 2019 and the following years. Public demand particularly with highways has begun to contribute to the recovery and overall construction activity across many of our states. Highway-related construction starts and Vulcan markets have moved further into positive territory. This is now 29% higher on a trailing-12-month basis, outpacing the nation as a whole by 14%. As we all know, we've seen a significant inflow of highway funding across our footprint. We've also seen a number of state DOTs struggle to take new funding and put it to work. Now, we are seeing DOTs adjusting and beginning to catch up, allowing the benefits of the FAST Act and the new state-level revenue streams to turn into tangible infrastructure development. For example, we anticipate solid gains in highway-related demand in six of our key states; Arizona, California, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Texas. We are keeping an eye on a number of states that have good highway-funding programs where we may see some shipments later in 2018. Let me add, we expect much more in 2019 and the following years. This would include California, which continued its effort to pull projects forward; coupled with Texas, South Carolina and Tennessee. Our local teams have been doing a really good job servicing our customers in both public and private markets. Our expanding backlogs and accelerating booking pace continues for our full-year outlook for aggregates shipments in the range of 200 million tons. As I said earlier, recent good weather has met good shipments including during April. This demand visibility will support additional pricing gains throughout the year. Other factors such as higher diesel costs and logistics' capacity constraints will also drive prices up. Some of our markets already anticipate another round of price increases this year. As we know, pricing momentum is stronger in those markets that have solid private and public demand visibility. Examples of these would include Georgia, Florida, and looking forward, Coastal Texas. But I would point out that our Aggregates pricing continues its upward compounding move across the majority of our markets. We continue to project full-year average selling prices to increase between 3% and 5%. We also expect that conversion of incremental same-store revenue into incremental gross profit will return to levels seen early in the recovery. I'm pleased to report that our Aggregates operating teams performed well in the first quarter and they remain focused on continuing our world-class safety performance. They are well-positioned to handle the expected upswing in shipments with solid operational efficiencies. And we're moving past the cost pressures of recent quarters. For example, the first of our new Panamax-class ships has been delivered and put into service. This is bringing new shipping efficiencies and lowering costs. Our current projections point to cash, gross profit per ton exceeding $6.50 by the end of the year. And remember, at the beginning of the recovery, this figure was $4.19. This improvement is proof that our local operating teams have and will remain focus on long-term improvement in unit margins. Our asphalt and concrete operations are well positioned as we head into the construction season. As noted, material margins in asphalt may continue to see some pressure from higher liquid AC prices. This depends in part on how quickly prices adjust. That said, our 2017 acquisitions continue to perform well. In summary, we have strengthened our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures and our demand and margin indicators along with our first quarter performance, particularly in March, give us confidence in full year expectations for net earnings and EBITDA. John, I'll turn it over to you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Tom. In addition to driving our current period results, we are, of course, always working to improve the business's longer term financial strength and growth potential. The first quarter saw several actions in this regard, and I'd like to highlight a few that relate to our organization, our asset portfolio, our balance sheet, and our after tax cash flow from earnings. With respect to the organization, in January, we restructured several of our support functions for the purpose of more effectively and efficiently serving our local operating units and supporting their long-term growth. And in the process, we eliminated approximately 50 overhead positions. Our first quarter results include a $4.2 million charge associated with this action. We are continuously working to leverage SAG to revenue growth, while at the same time making strategic investments in customer service, logistics management, sourcing and other of what we call One Vulcan capabilities. In terms of our asset portfolio, we are very focused on the integration of Aggregates USA during the first quarter. But we also continue to strengthen our portfolio in other important ways. For example, we completed the acquisition of a construction materials business in Alabama, adding aggregates and asphalt operations to complement our existing business very well. We also divested our Georgia ready-mix concrete operations to Thomas Concrete. Thomas is better positioned to grow that particular business, and we will continue to supply aggregates to the divested facilities. Our first quarter results include a small gain associated with this divestiture. Now, moving to the balance sheet. In the first quarter, we issued $850 million of senior notes with maturities of 3 and 30 years; and retired $885 million of debt with maturities inside of four years. Additionally, $111 million of senior notes due in 2037 were exchanged for a like amount of senior notes due in 2048. First quarter results include a $7.4 million pre-tax charge associated with this refinancing activity. We have positioned our debt portfolio for the long-term. It fits very well with the cyclicality of our industry, as well as with the long-life nature of our aggregate-centric asset base and our materials' real price appreciation over time. We have extended the duration of our debt, reduced our average interest rate and achieved and sustained investment-grade ratings. And at the same time, we've been able to fund over $1 billion of high-quality growth investments with only a marginal increase in our after-tax interest expense. Finally, I'll note that much of our long-range planning focuses, as you'd expect, on cash flow generation both at the local market level and the total company level. For 2018, we expect the business to generate approximately $825 million of after-tax cash flow from earnings. That's adjusted EBITDA, minus working capital growth, operating and maintenance CapEx, and cash taxes. As a reminder, we currently expect to invest $250 million in operating and maintenance CapEx for 2018. And at the midpoint of our earnings guidance, we project full-year cash taxes of approximately $75 million; and that's before the effects of debt refinancing actions, the use of AMT and other credits, and refunds from prior periods. This run rate cash tax expectation is approximately $100 million lower than if under the prior tax law. With disciplined capital deployment and compounding improvements in unit margins, our aggregate-centric business model should enable further significant gains in after-tax cash flow from earnings as the recovery moves forward. Tom, back over to you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you, John. Our peoples' commitment to outstanding performance has set us up very well for the future. We really like what we're seeing in the business right now. So I'd like to give you five examples. First, shipment growth. The private side continues to grow. And, now, public spending has joined the party and is also driving demand growth. Second, pricing growth. This is driven by underlying private and public demand and visibility to projects, both large and small. Third, unit margin improvement driven by operations excellence and a tight focus on cost control with flow-throughs returning to past trends. Fourth, near and long-term cash flow growth, which reflects the value of our aggregates-focused strategy and franchise. And, fifth, disciplined strategic M&A activity and capital deployment that allows us to leverage our strengths and create new opportunities for profitable growth. In closing, I'm pleased with the way our people are executing. They are demonstrating great discipline in taking incremental revenues to the bottom line, and I am very encouraged by the growing strength that we see in the recovery. We are well-positioned to serve this increasing demand growth, and we are very much looking forward to making the most of the opportunities ahead of us. And, now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : And we'll go first to Adam Seiden with Barclays. Adam Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, fellows. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning to you, too. So the first month or two, I guess, was perhaps a bit more challenging; and March, it seemed a bit better. And then now in the call, certainly, you pointed to April also seems like continuing some of the attraction that you guys were seeing in March. Just wondering though if you could give us any color on how we should think about the cadence on both volumes priced through the year? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I would tell you that we feel really good about our volume guidance, and Q1 reinforced that. It's not unusual for us to have tough shipping days in January, February. But as I said in my comments, prepared comments, when the sun shine and we're shipping hard, March's pace was up 7% and that wasn't what I'd call reasonable, not-great weather. (18:43) was in the middle of that, we had a lot of rain in California in March. And then April, following that, has been very strong. I'd tell you it's in the 10-ish on the same-store basis, up 10%. We're seeing the big postponed projects starting to ship. I'd tell you our folks are on track. We feel good about the volume guidance, and what kind of reinforces that, I think there's a couple of things. Our backlogs are up. Our booking pace has accelerated. The DOTs are moving for our projects and kind of a small thing, but it's really a tell-tale as we're shipping more on weekends right now than I've seen a ship in years. So, the demand is out there and I think it will flow through as we predicted throughout the year. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And, Adam, you and others know that, but keep in mind it's a low-volume quarter. We're just ramping in the construction season. We really like what we see in March and April in terms of what it means for how we're ramping up. Always careful about extrapolating from any one month, but we like what we're seeing. Some of the mix effects we saw in terms of volume in Q1 really should correct themselves over the year. And I kind of note that you saw us down in some of our core Southeastern and mid-Atlantic markets and up and other markets in the quarter, that was really mostly about weather and in some cases some rail service disruptions, all stuff we'll work through over the course of the year. And in the same vein, Tom, may comment on this further \u2013 that really is what affected reported pricings. The real momentum in pricing is 3% in the quarter. And just to give you a little more feel for that, Tom may chime in, but those markets that we were down in volume in the quarter were also the markets that we were \u2013 they're not only higher price, they were the most increasing in price. So, if you look across those markets like Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgias, you'd see price increases in the quarter that read like 5%, 6%, 8%. And so, the momentum in those markets reflects the visibility that Tom mentioned. Mix affected reported pricing in the quarter, but the underlying momentum was really 3%. And that will correct itself for the course of the year. It's not an issue for us. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, let me -- if you don't mind, let me take you, I think it's better done if we just take into the fabric of the business, and I'll pick three markets or three states starting on the West Coast, California. And if you look at Northern, Central California demand is good and growing, private is up, public is up substantially. And that's ahead of SB1. We saw really good price increases in April in Northern California. Southern California also seeing solid growth profits underpinned by res, public again is solid, ahead of SB1. Prices were solid in April, and that's on the back of really big price increases in 2016 and 2017. And if you really step back and look at California as a whole, volumes are growing ahead of SB 1, which gives \u2013 we got some more confidence and visibility to the public demand as ahead of us, which is reinforcing those step pricing. If you move to East there from Texas, and I'd start with North Texas first, which is really the DFW metroplex, and as I guess our smallest market in Texas, we'd tell you demand has been on roll for years. This year it will be up slightly. Price increases were a little tough in the DFW metroplex, the April ones. We announced those April price increases, but they met with some resistance. If you move South, into San Antonio, we see continuously solid growth in San Antonio, particularly highways in 2018. We've got big highway work ahead of us that we've already started. And the April price increases stuck, and I would tell you that the bid work with things like based on project work is moving up as we speak. It'll move up throughout the year. Going from there to Houston, now; Coastal Texas, which is really driven by Houston, this is a market that's been a drag on us for two years. It's been a drag on volume. It's been a drag on price. And that was the energy market going down. Now, we've actually seen Houston turn over the last 30 to 60 days. Res is back. Non-res is coming. In fact, we're hearing bubbling of energy projects. The public side is solid and this is a market we think supply may be tight throughout the year in Houston. We'll implement some large fixed plant price increases in June. I would tell you that base prices have moved up on quarter work over the last 45 days, and we'll continue to press those throughout the year. And we also got to remember, we're working off a lot of old lower-price work in that market, actually in all of these markets. And then, if you move east to there, the southeast, and you look at just, for example, Georgia and Florida, they're stars. They've got excellent private demand growth. The public side has come on. The large projects have started. We had very good January and April price increases. And parts of Georgia and Florida is a place we'll probably see some midyear price increases. So, to kind of sum that up, if you step back, I think it's really clear that our shipping pace supports what you see in our full-year guidance. Adam Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Appreciate that, guys. That's pretty encouraging and also very thorough, too. So, maybe something a little bit more nuanced, but you spoke to the $4 million restructuring charge this quarter. I guess it's a fairly small amount. But just thinking about the $4 million beyond just the total dollar amount, is there any change in how you're approaching a portion of the business that resulted in you taking these actions or is it just about getting leaner? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think it's not just about getting leaner. It's really about getting better, and more is not necessarily better. And so, what we've tried to do is streamline the services to our line folks where they got exactly what they needed, not what we thought they needed in some cases. And then \u2013 and we actually gave them better personnel and better services. So, it is \u2013 a piece of that is getting leaner, but the main focus was to give better services and more consistent services to the folks that are actually making this money. Adam Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Appreciate that, guys. Operator : And we'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Hi, Trey. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: ...thank you, gentlemen. So for Aggregates USA, just trying to cut it up a little bit, it looks like things are progressing pretty well there, and I think you guys booked like something around 2 million tons, maybe a little below that in the quarter if my math is right, and you guys are guiding to 7 million tons for the year. So, that implies a pretty big contribution in the first quarter. I think we're around 27% or so, which is higher than normal for your overall business, for the overall company, I think it's closer to 20%. I understand this market has less seasonality, but still seems high. Is there something that would drive a higher 1Q shipment mix there for that business or did the quarter just outperform kind of what was expected there? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Let me make a couple of opening comments on Ag USA, and then John would give you the quarter. As we look at Aggregates USA today, I would tell you it is fully integrated and functioning as one company, it's all Vulcan, great folks and great assets. We believe that we're solidly on track to earn our projected $50 million in 2018. Now \u2013 or watch for us and we've experienced some real service headwinds, but we're working hard with railroads to get past those and I think we've kept our customers in rock and there we had to service them. So, that will be a watch for us. But we continue to see significant synergies developing that we're really going to experience until 2019 and 2020, just going to work through those. And I would include in that rail and logistical synergies along with big commercial synergies. And you step back and look at this \u2013 it's all underpinned with really strong demand and price growth in States of Georgia and Florida. So, good start to Ag USA, but I think really the \u2013 and we're solid there, but the real synergies will be in 2019 and 2020. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Trey, just in terms of the math, I think Tom hit it. I mean what'll 1appen in the quarter is we got some of the early synergy capture, and so on a total contribution basis, ag in EBITDA level or what we call a cash gross profit level, a strong incremental contribution that first quarter as we captured some of the initial overhead synergies and other synergies far more in synergy capture to come, as Tom said, in 2019 and 2020 even on that front. I'll note and we can talk about it offline if you would like. They don't like gross profit for doing contribution basis, it is lower because of the step up in the asset base and the higher DD&A per ton. So, if you're trying to look at incremental flow-through to gross profit, it'll be lower. If you're looking at the contribution, cash per ton, which of course really matters most, it will be higher. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it, okay. That's helpful. And I guess kind of sticking with that for a moment where I guess more on the aggregates side still. You, guys, had mentioned in the past and I know there was some commentary today on this as well. I just want to make sure that we're understanding the cadence correctly. John you mentioned, I think, I heard you right exceeding $6 of cash gross profit per ton by the end of the year in aggregates, and you, guys, have talked about seeing your incrementals kind of getting back to what we saw earlier in the recovery, which I'm thinking that was north of 60% for Legacy Vulcan and you reiterated your guide. So, just any help that you can give us on the cadence of that, kind of going into this 2Q, which just given the magnitude of the quarter, the size of the quarter, any color around that would be great.  I think, obviously, we're pleased with Q1. It was a good start. I thought that our folks performed even then with some headwinds of weather in the first couple of months. Pricing is, I think, I alluded to will grow throughout the year. We had, you know, some January price increases, with some April price increases, and then as we bid work, particularly on the base and some other bid work, it will move up throughout the year. And then John's comment obviously about the Southeast being a little slow in the first quarter and coming back and some of our strongest markets will add to that. I would add to that that, but if you look at our operating efficiencies and cost, I think we are very proud of that performance. Our folks in the first quarter, they actually lower total cost of sales in the face of pretty good headwinds of diesel, tough weather conditions in January and February, which was \u2013 eat you up on efficiencies. And then, we went ahead as is normal and just good operating discipline and took some plants down and this preventive maintenance or just big maintenance we had on plants in winter months, where we know operating efficiencies aren't good, it's going to be good and the shipments were low. So, they were ready for the season. In the face of all of that, they delivered cost below prior year. So, I think we're \u2013 and again, a good start. I think our operating folks really have their eye on the ball here and we feel good about where we're set up to go into the second quarter. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And, Trey, just taken the full year look and kind of looking at the guidance we reiterated today and what that implies for the balance of the year, just to make sure we're being clear here. We expect in the balance of the year to have rates of improvement year-over-year but, of course, better than we saw in the first quarter and we're proud of what we did in the first quarter. But if that shipment pace growth, we expect to be better. If it's pricing momentum, we expect to be better. If its unit margin improvement, which we really focus on a great deal, much better. If it's flow-throughs, above what you've seen recently, for sure more like what you saw earlier in the recovery, particularly you need to look at that on a same-store basis, but it's going to be north of 60%. So we like what we're set up. We've got a combination going forward for the full-year. I'm not just talking about the second quarter now, for the rest of the year that is good market conditions, we're covering demand particularly in public that we talked about. Make better execution, get some opportunities to improve own cost execution, we're very focused on. And then of course we do have easier comps in Q2 and Q3. So, all three of those things playing together. Again, we're reiterating our guidance today. We'd say not all that's going to happen in Q2. Still some things we're working through, but taking a full-year look, we feel good about where we stand right now. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Great thanks a lot for taking my questions. I'll turn it over. Good luck. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Then, we'll go next to Kathryn Thompson with Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. We as a firm focused a lot on the public side, particularly the changes you're seeing with state DOTs is a change of funding, but an area that we're finding interesting on is on the commercial or the non-res side where we're seeing more billion-type dollar projects that are queued to start up. The question for you, are you seeing those types of projects and the geographies where you compete or are you actually participate in them? If you could give a little bit more color on the types of projects on the non-res side that you're seeing in your backlogs. Thank you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Thank you. We'll see shipment growth in non-res throughout the year. It's in our markets. It's supported by our going backlog and an increased booking pace. There's a continuation of large projects. I would tell you it's concentrated on office, institutional government buildings. We're also seeing what's interesting, Kathryn, I mentioned in the comments about Coastal Texas is we're seeing early activity around energy projects on the Gulf Coast, and that is very encouraging. So, from \u2013 and if you look at our markets, I think we're solid with non-res growth, and I think we feel real good about it, and you're right. There are a lot of big projects out there. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Kathryn, I'd just add. We're seeing at the moment in our markets, and I should say in most of our Vulcan-served markets, which can be different than the nation as a whole. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Sure. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good booking momentum on small and large private non-res work. And we stay focused on that because as you know the large can be a little bit tricky to predict exactly when it turns into shipments. So we tend to very well and share that work. It tends to be a little bit lumpy and more difficult to predict exactly when it turns into a shipment. But for the balance of 2018, our backlog support, our outlook, as you know it's more uneven across geographies than residential would be. You have some shining stars and you have some that aren't. But in total, backlogs booking pace outlook consistent with our outlook, and we kind of like what we see going into 2019, although it's a bit early to draw those conclusions. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Thank you. And then on the public side, it's obviously too early to see the full impact of SB1 in California quite yet, but when you shift to a state such as Georgia that now has a couple of years under its belt with its increased funding. Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of what you're seeing in public construction flow-through in the State of Georgia? And in your opinion, how much of it is related more to the FAST Act versus the state-specific initiatives that they passed? Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: First of all, I'm not sure I can separate the FAST Act from the state funding in Georgia. All I'd tell you is, it's good with good. Georgia was a big disappointment for us for last year. It's going to be a big win for us this year with those jobs starting. And there's a number of them that start around the state of Georgia, and the state continues to work really hard to get more work out. I would also tell you the State of Georgia still has ground to catch up to be able to get that money to market, but they're working hard on it and they're a whole lot better off today than we were six months or a year ago. As far as the FAST Act is concerned, the appropriations actually increased the federal funding by 5%, that's about $1.8 billion. And Vulcan states were big winners with that. Of that $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion of it, well, almost $1.3 billion of it, will go to our 20 states. So we're enjoying the FAST Act now and we're looking forward to enjoying even bigger money coming from the FAST Act to our states. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Kathryn, a couple of just other quick comments for you and others on Georgia. Let me reflect a little bit on kind of quarterly timing \u2013 and you all do a lot of great work on this, so you probably know this. But if we're looking a year ago, we're looking at Georgia, we're trying to guess when a certain project is going to start. Now, we're a little more focused on how well the DOT, GDOT and our contracting customers will get the work done, will they be able to stay on schedule and actually take our product in the timing we expect. And so, as it relates to Q2, we're keeping a little bit of an eye just on shipping, pace of projects that have already started. But, in total, we feel like GDOT and the contracting base in Georgia is beginning to a little bit catch the tiger by the tail, if you will, and begin to get caught up. I don't know that they're all the way where they want to be. They just got a lot of stuff they're trying to do. And so, we'll just kind of keep an eye on that. But that's really a timing issue, not a trend issue. As you know, the work is there, and as we sit here now, the work has started for the most part, and it's just a question of how quickly we get the shipments out. It's another good example of Georgia, by the way, Kathryn, of a market \u2013 it's a great example of a market where that visibility to public and private, where that visibility links back to pricing. So even in a quarter where, again, due to weather impacts, volumes were down in Georgia, pricing was up a good healthy amount, again, due to that visibility. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : And following up, just Georgia is a good example, and as we look at other states, could you be in a situation where you are tighter in availability of a certain type of product, particularly clean stone, once you get into peak of the construction season or do you feel pretty good where you are today? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think that we will see a number of markets around the country get tight on stones. Some of that will be, in general, like we mentioned, some of Coastal Texas and some of that would be specific sizes. I think we have the firepower to deliver, but I think that you could see some tightness in some markets. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Kathryn, sometimes that tightness and for others is due to logistics reasons, e.g., rail service quality or, in some cases, tight trucking capacity. It's not due to an inability of Vulcan to produce, just to be clear. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: (38:57). J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: But Coastal Texas is probably a good example of that where we would expect to see, although is a bit of a drag on our pricing in Q1, we expect that to turn. And some of that is turning, as we speak, and it's reinforced by our taking ship deliveries, it's reinforced by our getting the dredging started where we get more full draft ships in. So that's an example where we see potentially a pretty sharp turn. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: In think same thing is true for some of Georgia and Florida also. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. And final question is on margins, and I think you touched on it earlier in the Q&A, but I just want to make sure that I'm clear. It's around incremental margins. Just in light of some of the variety of puts and takes with cost, diesel, dredging, et cetera, how should we think about core company incremental margins for the remainder of 2018? Thank you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: If you mean by core company, it's called same-store as in Ag USA. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Yeah, yeah. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think I'd expect to see numbers more like what you saw in 2015 as we had volumes 5-plus-percent growth than, certainly, anything that we saw in 2017. And our focus again is very much on compounding improvements in unit margins. And we expect to deliver significantly further improvements in the balance of the year on our unit margins. Again, if you're looking at incremental flow-throughs, incremental revenue to incremental gross profit, you really are going to want to look at it on a same-store basis. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Yeah. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Again, the DD&A per ton on Ag USA is going to be double that for the rest of the company. So, again, it just will distort the answer, so you want to look at that on the same-store basis. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Yeah, yeah. And that was the intention, just to look at it on a same-store basis. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : All right. Thank you for answering my questions today. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Okay. We'll go next to Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Hi. You folks, in the press release, spoke about the weakness in Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia in the first quarter. I'm wondering can you just talk about how demand trended in those markets in March and April. How much did those markets snap back compared to what you laid out as having played out in the first quarter and those markets in the press release? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think, first of all, that was all weather-related, the underlying demand is there. When the sun's out, just like everything else, they're shipping. In fact, they're really strong in all those states, from Georgia all the way up through Virginia and in Florida. And as we've moved into March and April, like the rest of the country, all that is moving up. And one of the places I think is interesting is that's particularly a place of the country where weekend work is particularly strong which just underscores that the work's there. If those contractors didn't have the work and had to be pushed, they wouldn't spend over time to work Saturdays and Sundays. So that's a very good signal of what we saw in March and April and even right now what's going on with weekend work. So I don't think we have any worries about the Southeast. In fact, as I said in an earlier question, I would tell you that places like \u2013 of the Southeast are really stars. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We have some minor concerns about rail service quality and some of those rail served markets that's really not Atlanta, but other parts of Georgia, but Jerry I think that's something we're working through. In some ways, it's both an opportunity and a challenge. And I don't know that it necessarily affects any full year outlook. So if your question is, have we seen reversals from the Q1 pattern, the answer I think is yes. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Appreciate the context. And in terms of the logistics issues, so we have rail costs and, in addition, we have the transition on the vessels. Can you just give us a rough sense of putting the logistics issues together? How much of a headwind was it this quarter and how would you expect that to play out over the course of the year? Is there a line of sight on the logistic issues anticipating within the next couple quarters? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'm going to separate those into two buckets. First of all, let's talk about the rail. As you know, all the railroads are having challenges right now, service challenges and we're working hard with them to make sure that we service our customers. There's both challenges and opportunities to that. The challenges will be that we've got to meet our customers' demands. And we also got to meet those demands in growing markets, which is a good thing. So there will be some tightness there, and that's compounded by tight trucking and rising fuel costs. Again, while that is a challenge, it's also an opportunity type markets, tend to be good for us. The \u2013 on the other side of this, which leads me into the shipping, we have the most flexible logistics network in the country. We're on multiple markets, we're on multiple rails, so we do have flexibility to get our customers a product. And then, on top of that, we have substantial barge service, and then, we have the most sophisticated rail service throughout the Gulf and on the East Coast. So, those logistics while they are challenges, I think they're also opportunities and that's our job to make sure they're opportunities. And as we said, John, and I've said a couple of times, it'll create tight supply. On our ships and our logistics, we're still working through. We've gotten a long ways through our headwinds that we saw last year with the storms and ships, the dredging on the Texas call is happening now. We'll be doing that in the second quarter, so we'll be past that as we enter the third quarter. We've had one ship delivered in April and we'll have the other before the end of the second quarter, so we'll be walking out of those headwinds also in the second quarter. So, I think to sum it up, from a shipping perspective on Blue Water, we should have any of that behind us as we hit the third quarter. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Jerry, we think that's an important point. It's all consistent with our full-year plans, but won't all be done in Q2. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then, lastly, it's been a while since you folks had asphalt gross profits that were breakeven. Can you just talk about a little bit more on the moving piece in the quarter? I would have expected California to have had a pretty good quarter, given with the amount of works. And maybe if you can just frame out how the quarter played out and whether you expect to return to growing gross profits in asphalt business in the second quarter. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. First of all, I would tell you that gross profits in asphalt will grow throughout the year. The first quarter I'd describe is two things. Now, this is a place we have felt some inflationary pressures. The first quarter, same-store asphalt business was impacted with big increases in liquid AC, in raw materials, in energy costs. And we've just \u2013 we're trying to pass that through and it'll take us a number of quarters to get that passed through, but that will happen. It always does. The other thing that was in there in the quarter that is not as clear is the ownership, the full-year ownership of our business, our asphalt business in Tennessee. And as you can imagine, in Middle Tennessee, that is dramatically affected by weather in January-February. You're just not going to do anything. So, you're going to lose money in those first two months. I would also tell you that we did very well with that business in Tennessee last year. We will do even better with that business this year in Middle Tennessee. It is a \u2013 and by the way, they are very busy right now. I was up there in April, got first hand to meet the crews and the management team, extremely well-run, extremely well-integrated, and this is going to be a star for us in 2018. We're thrilled with that business. So, let the year flow through. We got to catch up on prices to overcome inflationary pressures. And then, we'll see the Tennessee business; it's popping back now. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Phil Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. It sounds like you're putting... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : ...morning. It sounds like you're pretty encouraged that the DOTs have finally started to catch up on funding. And now that you have some of these bottlenecks easing, can we see some of that pent-up demand from last year to catch up in 2018? And can you provide some upside to your mid-single digit volume guidance? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think that what we see in highways is consistent with what's in our plan. And we are seeing some of that DOT catch-up and flow-through, particularly in Georgia. And you'll see some of that \u2013 obviously, the mature states like Texas and Florida are doing very well. But I think that \u2013 which really is \u2013 the catch-up is the large projects that have started and are shipping. And there's a whole bunch of that in Georgia, but there's also a fair amount of that around the country. I mean, I could give you half a dozen jobs and I'll give you a few, but the Poplar Island job in Maryland though \u2013 in Winston-Salem, the Northern Beltway, which is over 300,000 tons, I-77 in Charlotte. We've talked a number about three or four big jobs in Georgia, but you've got Fort Myers SR 52 widening, which is 0.25 million tons and Highway 109 and 11 in Tennessee which is a couple hundred, and then San Antonio, the 281, 1604 job, which is \u2013 that's 1.5 million ton job. And then, the Connect 202 in Arizona has started, which is up over time at 2.5 million ton job. So, it's really those big jobs have started, starting to flow through. And then, you're starting to see more small work come out of the DOTs as bidding activity goes up. For example, Texas will bid a $1 billion a month between now and August in their highway lettings. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : That sounds like pretty interesting. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I might characterize that with the CFO hat on is a little bit of the work is there as Tom said. Work has been there. We have seen good patterns. Even if you go back to Q4 we saw when we had \u2013 whether we had good shipments. But the DOTs and the contractors are not all the way caught up. They're making progress, but we're still going to be a little bit cautious even in terms of our own cost structure. And these are hard things we're trying to do and different than they've done for a long time and highly complex projects. And so, we want to keep a close eye on the actual shipment pace, and just to be more clear, we are not upping our full-year volume guidance today. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Got it. That's helpful. And then some of these DOTs are appreciate that it's a work in progress. Can you give a little more color in any states that stand out and you called out Georgia and it sounds like Texas and Florida is doing okay, but any color around that would be helpful? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Well, you've got three states that are \u2013 that passed bills last year, California, South Carolina and Tennessee. And you just while there \u2013 particularly California has done a great job of accelerating. They only got $4.5 billion \u2013 $2.5 billion of work out there in the fix-it-first projects. You're not going to see those states get much work through until 2019 and 2020. We've got a few paving jobs, really overlay jobs that we'll see in Tennessee. I think there's 11 that would constitute about 1 million tons that we either have backlog, we're bidding or we know we're going to bid on. And so, you'll see a little bit of that, but I wouldn't \u2013 those new states, I wouldn't put much into this. Georgia, we've talked a lot about, so I'm not going to cover that. And in Texas, Texas is still working through because they continue to increase their funding. They have one of the more mature, sophisticated DOTs to get big work out. We just bout talked $1 billion a month in lettings from between now and August, but they're still working to get out and don't remember they've got \u2013 in 2019, they got another $2.5 billion that have come into play with Prop 7. So all of these states, while they're doing better, they still got a hill to climb to get it up and to get that work. They get that money to work. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That sounds pretty promising. It sounds like that gives you a lot of runway and even maybe for things to kind of pick up a little bit going into 2019. And from a pricing standpoint, you talked about how there are certain markets that you called out like Georgia, Florida, and Texas. You could see incremental round of price increases. I assume that's on top of what's been out there for January and April. Can you kind of size up the percentage of your portfolio that could see that benefit and just kind of help us figure out from a timing perspective when would that potentially kick in? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. So, I would tell you that the vast majority of our markets are seeing price increases, and most these markets are really right for price improvements. You've got the private work that's been there. Now, you've got the public demand that's coming on, people have visibility, both to small and large projects. Our April price increases were in place. As I said earlier, in a number of markets, we're pushing up what I call bid work or project bid work as they now continue as the year progresses. Some markets \u2013 we talked about some markets that'll see mid-year, I mentioned parts of Georgia and parts of Florida and some of the East Coast, maybe some of North Carolina to name a few. And remember, we'll continue to work off that older work. I think what gives us confidence in price, I'd summarize in four different places. Number one, the April price increases stuck, some midyear price increases are coming. Number two, you heard us talk about tight supply in some markets. Number three, remember, we've got an inflationary environment that's going on, which only reinforces price increases. And fourth and probably most important is visibility, and not just ours but our competitors' and our customers' visibility to take risk on work \u2013 take risk on price because there's no more work behind it. But if you are a member of our management team and you sat through meetings and we visit every state in the first quarter \u2013 and by the way, that was really good for us \u2013 it'd be very clear to you what our pricing strategy and philosophy is across all products and all product lines. So, I think it's shaping up to be a solid year on pricing. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Got it. And just one last one from me. From a SAG performance in the quarter, certainly very constructive, seeing some nice benefits on the restructuring front, but you did reiterate that $335 million target for the full year. Were there any one-time benefits in the quarter or could there be actually some opportunity here? Thanks. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: No unusual one-time benefits in the quarter. And, obviously, we're tracking ahead of guidance and are trailing 12 months, I think, is around $320 million. We're absolutely still focused on the productivity of SAG, as Tom said. It's about being better, not just leaner. At the moment, we're holding our guidance on this consistent. And we're holding our full-year guidance, as we said, full-year EBITDA, full-year net earnings guidance consistent. You know, we're just one quarter-end. As excited as we are about how the season is ramping up, we're one quarter end. I would tell you to get a little bit behind SAG and this is not new for us. The S has been growing a little bit. We're making investments in sales and customer service as you'd expect. The A and G has been shrinking a little bit as we get leaner, better on the administrative side, all things you'd expect us to do. And I think we tell you that, that is an ongoing effort, not something we did just in January and we're done. So, I think it will continue to be leaner and better in some places and we'll continue to make some investments in areas that ultimately drive better customer service and drive higher margins, whether that's sourcing, logistics capabilities, et cetera. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thanks a lot. Good luck on the quarter. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Okay. We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Two quick questions. First of all, can you provide me any additional color on backlogs today versus prior years? And then, secondly, can you put a percentage on how many markets might see a second price increase? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We really don't give -- we don't quote numbers on backlogs for all kinds of different reasons. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: We'll give you a directional sense. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. But there's up and, actually, our backlogs are up in the vast majority of our markets, I think as important as that is our booking pace is faster than it was a year ago, faster than it was a quarter ago and it is picking up speed. And that's really demonstrates the health of the demand \u2013 the increase in demand and what's going on the markets. And that's pretty \u2013 if you look at beneath that and look at the different segments of private and public, the private continues, the public has picked up a lot. So, I think that's \u2013 as I said earlier, that's one of the things that really gives us confidence. And in our full-year projection and it reinforces what we saw \u2013 what we saw in March and what we saw in April and things to come. If we have another way to put it is on the volume side, if we had any risk in our full-year projection, it's not because of the backlog, it's not because of the booking pace where we stand; it's just how quickly that backlog work turns into shipments. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Yes. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Back to the point about, they're making progress, but DOTs and large contractors, you know, they \u2013 not only there, there's a big complicated things of trying to get done. And while some of the type logistics issues we face are really get for pricing, do they limit in some ways, how quickly we can convert backlog work into shipments. Not trying to be \u2013 just trying to be a little cautious but not extrapolating from Q1 to the rest of the year. At the same time, everything we see reinforces our full year outlook. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Okay. And any chance I can get you to put a percentage on second price increase? I mean, in terms of percentage of region. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think, I think \u2013 well first of all, it's market dependent, it is broad spread, I mentioned places like parts of Georgia, parts of Florida, maybe parts of North Carolina and the East Coast. And we talked about Coastal Texas and the opportunities in Coastal Texas. So, that's one piece of it. The other piece it is not just in announced price increase, but it is the bid one \u2013 this is really important is the bid work as you bid projects all along. You continue to press that price. We talked about base in Houston as an example of that. We talked about base in Florida and \u2013 sand in Florida and in Georgia. So, that's really tough to do. It is \u2013 the key there is those four things that I named that reinforce price, particularly visibility that allow you to continue to press that up. And remember, those downstream customers are also pressing their prices because of that visibility and the knowledge of the work to come. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And put it differently, this is the same thing we said in February. But what we're seeing in the market conditions is such that we expect pricing momentum to continue to build throughout the year, almost being a little bit back-end-loaded relative to maybe prior cycles, in part because of work we're working off and they work working into, in part because of the dynamics that Tom mentioned, in part due to things like future price increases in certain markets. So, pricing, I'd expect to continue to play out and build momentum over the year. But I think you could tell from Tom our directions pretty clear. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great color. Thanks, guys. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to beat the dead horse on mid-year pricing, just wondering, first off, did you get mid-year price increases in any market last year? And maybe just looking backwards, when was the last time that you're able to talk about mid-year opportunities and raising prices on bid work? Are we going back to the last cycle, or had there been more recent instances in which the market was supportive of this type of developments? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I would tell you, probably in the last couple of years, that's been tough. Really, 2015 is when we saw that activity. Again, I think what's helping that this year and the difference between 2018 and maybe 2016 to 2017 is the visibility on the public side and more work being bid and it continued to bubble up. Again, Coastal Texas is a little different. It's a place of market that turned, that went down substantially and now has turned. And so, that one that would be an outlier. But the big shift or the magnitude of the shift is bigger there than most markets. So to answer your question, probably 2015. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just my last question is just on the downstream profit outlook. You maintain your guidance for profit growth in asphalt and concrete. Wondering, are you expecting to grow margins in those businesses this year just given asphalt inflation and the timing of getting pricing, and then also material increases on the concrete side? So is the profit growth coming from both margin expansion and top line or is it just limited to top line right now? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: On margin expansion in asphalt, it's going to be tough. We've got catch-up to do within, as I talked about, the inflationary factors. So unit margin in asphalt, as they always do, when the liquid goes up are tough, but they always catch up and we'll be plugging it out as the year goes along. I think that you will see, I believe, margin expansion ready mix as the year progresses and I'll be more bullish on that, that I would be on asphalt. But I do think this, as we stated our guidance is \u2013 we will stick with it, at this point, and I think we will do that. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Scott Schrier with Citi. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You talked a lot about the areas where you've had a lot of strength and the different price increases and everything. I'm curious if for some of the regions that have been more challenging for you and whether they've weighed down your top line pricing even on a like-for-like basis. Can you talk about if any of those regions, if you're seeing the potential for them turning a corner on both pricing and also on the volume front? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: The one that I mentioned and probably stands out the most is Coastal Texas, which it really brought down \u2013 it fell pretty dramatically in volume and price in 2016 to 2017. With that turn in Coastal Texas along with some tightness in supply and both the public and now the private work coming back, I think that one's a good example. I would tell you that places \u2013 we're going to struggle with price and our struggle with price is Illinois, and it's just a tough market for us. Another place would be Louisiana. We've had huge energy work in Louisiana in 2015 and 2016, and we just didn't have it in 2017 and don't have it in 2018. Now, with the energy projects starting to bubble back up, we got our fingers crossed that Louisiana will follow Coastal Texas, and we'll see more work. But that's not going to happen in 2019. Obviously, that's not going to happen in 2018, maybe in 2019, maybe in 2020, and it will be a watch for us. So those would be a couple that I think \u2013 two or three that I would point out and they're different cadences. As I said, we're struggling in two of them. One of them we're seeing a \u2013 because one of them we're seeing a turn and expect prices and volumes to come up in the Texas piece, but not in Louisiana or Illinois. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: But they'll still be a drag in the total company reported results... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: ...to your point. In 2018, no big change there. Team is doing a great job locally, by the way; great job on cash generation. But from a pricing point of view, we don't see that turning in 2018 in those markets. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. If you look at quality of earnings in Illinois, I'd tell you, to John's point, very good. They just dealt a tough hand right now, but they're playing it well. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then, can you talk about the concrete business a little more? We saw the strong ready-mix pricing. Is that a function of market fundamentals or geographic mix as well? I know in the past you've had a lot of strength in Virginia. It looks like that was a market that was impacted by some of the severe weather. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think that it was impacted by severe weather. I think as we look at North Virginia and the non-res in North Virginia is going to be a strength for us. They'll have a good year. It goes back to California, we'll have solid price increases. Texas, we believe, will do fine and that's really San Antonio with prices. But it goes back to the same thing, particularly in those three markets, and that is visibility of work to come and people being able to \u2013 our customers being able to take a risk and put more profitability in it. And we're able to put more profitability into ours. So it's really the same dynamics in those three markets as aggregates, and it's a function of the structure of those markets and the demand in those markets. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: It is true that the acquisitions and divestitures we've made on balance will improve our reported \u2013 they have a positive impact on our material margins is the way I would think about it. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Okay. We'll go next to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Timna. Timna Beth Tanners - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to just touch base if we could on the cost side with cost inflation being a big theme across so much of the material space. If diesel prices continue to creep up, then should we assume that that's immediately offset or that there's a lag effect there, is it small? And what kind of cost inflation is embedded in your guidance at this point? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Well, I think as we said, our diesel impact in the first quarter was \u2013 diesel was around $0.11. And while it was a headwind, we still finished below year-over-year total cost of sales. I think that it will take time, as we say, always is to pass that along. But it is \u2013 and you heard me talk about, it is happening, it will happen \u2013 but it will be throughout the year. As far as how we feel about our operating position, we said we got a few things to work off in Q2 from the storm and shipping effects, but we'll get those behind us and we're working had to do that. And I think that our plants and operating folks are in good shape. And we're executing well, and that was underscored in our first quarter performance. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Timna, I'd also just highlight that given it's such a big topic out there, I'd remind folks \u2013 you on the call know this \u2013 but we're so aggregates-focused that inflationary pressures play out a little bit differently for us than it might for other materials company and certainly for other industrials. Reminder, in Aggregates, we own our biggest cost input : it's the capital; it's the quarry. Diesel is relatively small factor, a swing factor. But given the weight to value ratio, higher diesel creates a wider economic moat naturally around individual quarries. It's ultimately a good thing for us. There will be a lag in terms of it passing through the pricing, absolutely. When it spikes up, like it did this quarter, you won't see it all flow through the same quarter. But even with an intermediate-term view, it's not something that I know our team is concerned about. In fact, strategically, we kind of like higher diesel prices. So we're in a little bit of a different position. Now in an individual quarter in the very short-term, is it a drag? Yes. But strategically much less of an issue for us given that we own the key input than it would be for many other businesses. Timna Beth Tanners - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: That's understood. Thanks. And then, if you wouldn't mind, just can you give us any updated thoughts on M&A opportunities? Are they compelling small, large, any color that you can provide there? Thanks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I would tell you kind of business as usual. There's plenty of them out there. We continue to be picky and make sure the ones that fit us are the markets that we want and to make sure we don't overpay and that we're disciplined and that plus the integration as we talked about. So, yes, they're still there. Yes, we're still looking at them and, yes, we're going to be very selective in what we choose to pursue, much less what we choose to buy. Timna Beth Tanners - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: All right. Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Then, we'll go next to Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Hi, Stanley. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Most things have been asked, but I did have a quick question for you on California. Certainly, a lot of positive things to say out there. Is there a way to parse out kind f that core business that you have versus SB1 or maybe kind of talk about your thoughts just as the general market as a whole ex-SB1? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. We touched on that in the beginning, but for the sake of repeating myself, I will. All of 2018, we would tell you and what we have in our numbers and our plan is pre-SB1. If we get some SB1 in there, it will be a bonus for us for the year. The public side is coming on. We had actually a down year in public in California in 2017; 2018, we are seeing it be up. They will help both our aggregates and asphalt business. All of that is pre-SB1. The private side continues to remain strong, particularly res. And we saw that the non-res is not solid. And then, you heard me talk about price increases, very strong in Northern California and solid in Southern California. So, our operating performance is actually improved. This time last year, we were facing pretty tough floods in Southern California. Though we saw rain in March, we didn't see those kind of problems. And I think throughout 2017, we did a lot of things in California to improve some specific large operations and we're seeing those results. We saw it in the first quarter and we'll see it throughout the year. So, our numbers while we're very excited about SB1, I would tell you that's post 2018 at this point. If we get something, we will welcome it, we'll be thrilled with it, but I wouldn't expect in 2018. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. And then... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Stanley, in terms of the current outlook, a lot of people forget that in California, SB1 gets a lot of appropriate attention that there's been a very significant increase in this very local funding measure and other items and some of that will play out in our plans and more maintenance activity from a public side, overlay works, smaller projects, some of that is in our 2018 plan. But for all the folks in SB1, people forget that there's a very large increase from things like Measure M or the local initiatives. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. No. That's fair. And then, a general theme at least from my takeaway is that the public side is looking a lot better than it was last year. Do you think that's because of the change that the administration has put through on the regulatory front or do you think it's at state DOTs that finally have been able to catch up and be staffed and things like that to get projects out the door? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: In my mind, it would be the second half. It would be \u2013 and we've talked a lot about this, state DOTs are starting to catch up. They're starting to deploy those funds. They're starting to put them to work. And that's both in \u2013 there's a lot of headlines about the big work and I named a few of them, but it's not just the big work, it is also a lot of small work, a lot of overlays or smaller road widenings. And you're just seeing them catch up, both to their funding and to the improved FAST Act funding. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Started to catch up. Not all the way though? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: No. They've got a long ways to go. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds great, guys. Thanks and best of luck. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Hi, Brent. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Any guess how far off normalized levels the demand in Houston or kind of the Gulf Coast overall might be right now? I'm just trying to think about how far down that business went and kind of the upsides from here. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. It went down volume-wise double digit, probably a little bit or more than that. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Two years in a row. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Two years in a row. And some of that, remember, we had very, very large energy projects that were very profitable because of our unique ability to deliver by ship, and we're very \u2013 so, they were very high priced, and all that all of a sudden went away. That, coupled with \u2013 you saw the private side and res and non-res go down. The highway stuff has always been kind of a staple, but those two really hurt that market, the pricing in that market, the volume in that market, and the profitability. So, the important thing is we've seen a turn there, both on the private side with res, and you're starting to see \u2013 and the small non-res. Like I said, we're seeing the energy. And the highway work in Coastal Texas and Houston has been good. It is growing. It continues to grow. And this will be a process to work through. It's not all of a sudden like we go right back to 2015 and 2018 in Coastal Texas. The important thing in this turn is moving the other way. And we thought that was going to happen in 2017, and then we got slammed with hurricanes and storms. And that's also \u2013 we had to work out of that. So, we're looking forward to an improved year in 2018 and over the next couple years, getting back to what we saw in 2015. Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Tom, the hang-up kind of executing these public jobs in Georgia southeast for weather-related reasons over the last, I guess, three quarters or so, has that held up the DOTs and kind of related agencies in terms of getting new work out just because there isn't the capacity to survey? And what I'm getting at, if that's the case, could we run into a situation where we have a hole or lag again in terms of those markets in working through the public side of things? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think what held up those big jobs \u2013 and obviously weather was an impact in the Q3 with hurricanes and troubles going to the southeast, but that didn't hold up the DOTs. The DOTs are still working on \u2013 those works had been letted \u2013 had been let. They have been awarded. And so, they were out there trying to get going. Some of that was, there was \u2013 all of them were impacted by weather. Others were impacted by right of way issues, environmental issues, contractor issues. So, that I don't think was a drag on the DOT. In the meantime, the DOT on a parallel course is working on other jobs and other work. So, I don't think they're in series. I will call it in parallel and the DOTs continue to get better at what they do and what they're doing. But as John pointed out, they've still got a ways to go including Georgia's. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And then some of the large contractors now are also ramping up their own capacity and getting adjusted to this, too. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. And they did that in 2017. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We don't see a hole, but we're trying to be a little bit, I can say, cautious, bit as cautious in light of some very positive signals including around backlogs with respect to how quickly that turns into shipments, but not because it happens in series. It will still be happening parallel and will build on itself and begin to accelerate. Some of that really is why we see more in 2019 and 2020 than we do in 2018. Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Tom Hill, CEO, for closing comments. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company and we look forward to updating you, as we move forward to what promises to be a good year for us. Thanks for being here today. Operator : And this does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining our call today. Our second quarter results are another really solid step towards our longer-term goals. We finished the first half of the year on plan, and well-positioned to stay on plan for the balance of the year. The business is running well, as expected. And we're seeing good things come together. Higher public funding for transportation infrastructure is now converting into increased shipments. Pricing momentum, including our backlog work, continues to strengthen and we've turned the corner on cost challenges we faced in 2017 with flow-throughs moving towards long range norms. We expect each of these trends to continue through the second half of this year and into 2019. We are well-positioned for continued shipment growth, compounding pricing improvements, and further gains in unit profitability. Now, we experienced spikes in diesel and liquid asphalt costs, but these headwinds will be offset by pricing gains over time. Diesel prices have risen 28% year-over-year and 59% since June 2016. Those increases are not yet fully reflected in our reported product pricing. But we are already pricing worth (00:03:17) higher. Remember, higher logistics costs widen the natural economic moat around our quarries. Also, liquid asphalt prices have risen 22% year-over-year putting pressure on our Asphalt margins. But hear again, these headwinds will ultimately be offset, and we're already seeing prices improve. Good things are happening as public construction demand joins a sustained private recovery. And our Aggregates-focus business model positions us extremely well for this dual recovery. We are keeping our midpoint projection for full-year adjusted EBITDA at $1.2 billion. And we expect to move into 2019 with very good momentum in market demand, in shipments, and in pricing. Now, let me touch a bit more detail \u2013 on a bit more detail on the trends we're seeing in our core Aggregates segment with a focus on shipments, pricing, and cost. John will then recap our full-year outlook, and I'll sum up with some closing comments. First, our strength in shipments. Public demand is kicking in. We're finally beginning to see the transportation funding increases that passed in many Vulcan-served states showing up in our shipments. And as I pointed out last quarter, we expect this demand to build over multiple years as state DOTs and contractors deliver on their large backlogs of bigger and more complex projects. At the same time, private end-use demand in Vulcan-served markets continues to recover steadily, growing at a rate that is significantly ahead of the rest of the country. Our local sales teams are covering our markets and serving our customers well. We've taken steps to give them more time to partner with our customers and help them grow. They are reaping the benefits of more back office support, less paperwork, and more time with our customers, and it's paying off nicely. We expect strong shipment growth at a pace similar to the second quarter for the balance of the year, based on demand patterns and our booking pace. And the shipment results we reported this quarter don't yet reflect the strength we're seeing coming in California or Virginia. Those states were actually down in the quarter. Regarding California, we're very encouraged by the letting data we've seen in efforts to accelerate public projects. We're having success in booking key new jobs. We expect second half shipments in California to be up mid- to high-single digits over the prior year, with that growth still supported by strong private demand. We continue to expect the benefit of stronger public construction activity in California to start impacting our shipments in 2019. Meanwhile, we continue to focus on longer-term materials pricing improvements in this key state. Our average selling prices for aggregates in California improved 7% compared to the second quarter of 2017. So, to recap, we're seeing real strength in shipments, 11% same-store shipment growth in the quarter as public demand joined to sustain recovery in private demand with a similar growth rate expected for the remainder of the year. Second, let's talk about pricing. Geographic mix impacted our total reported average selling prices in the second quarter. Excluding this mix impact, average aggregate selling prices improved 3%. Given the continuing recovery and public demand, geographic and product mix may continue to affect reported average sales prices for the next few quarters. But let me tell you, I'm not concerned about this mix effect. It's good for the business to sell a full product mix and we're focused on driving prices higher for all product types. Please don't base funds (00:07:45) across all geographies. We like the pricing trends we're seeing in our backlogs. And project pricing continues to strengthen, and will throughout the year. We're pressing for second half price increases in many of our markets across all customer segments. As you know, there's a natural lag between pricing and shipments. For example, we're shipping today on several large public jobs, initially priced well over a year ago. Our reported pricing will benefit as we work off older jobs and shift on more recently quoted work. And, of course, the shipments strength we've experienced with public demand joining what has been a private-led recovery bodes very well for pricing strength into 2019 and beyond. Third, let's discuss how we convert that top line growth into profit growth. We're doing a good job controlling the cost that we can control, moving toward more normal flow-through rates on same-store incremental revenue. For the quarter, our unit cost of sales in Aggregates on a same-store basis fully adjusted was essentially flat. We delivered with operating leverage and shipment strength. But this per ton cost benefit was offset by the spike in diesel costs and also by distribution-related costs that are behind us as we move into the second half of the year. Excluding higher unit cost for diesel, our same-store flow-through rate on incremental sales for the first half was 56%, a clear move in the right direction. And we expect further improvements in the second half of the year. Diesel cost ultimately passed-through in our product pricing. But despite diesel, we finished the first half essentially on plan with respect to operating cost results and total gross profit for Aggregates segment. And following the flooding from Hurricane Harvey, we've now finished dredging our Houston port facility and our new ships are fully operational bringing additional cost efficiencies to the business in the second half of the year. Our continuing world-class safety record underscores our confidence in our operating discipline and execution. Our MSHA/OSHA incident rate through the first half of the year is less than one injury for every 200,000 employee hours worked. Our people are focused on every aspect of operational excellence and it shows. Now, I'll hand it off to John for a brief review of our full-year outlook for profitability and cash flow. John? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Tom. Let me begin by providing a bit more background regarding our balance of year outlook. In our core Aggregates segment, as Tom mentioned, we expect continued strength and shipments roughly in line with the second quarter results. We now project full-year same-store Aggregates shipment growth of between 7% and 9% compared to our beginning-of-year expectation of 4% to 6%. We expect freight-adjusted price increases in the second half of approximately 3% in line with our beginning-of-year projection. However, given geographic mix impacts through the first half, we now project a full-year increase in reported freight-adjusted average selling prices of 2% to 3%. Absent these mix impacts, which are largely tied to stronger than expected shipments in certain lower priced markets, pricing momentum was in line with our plans through the first half and should strengthen through the second half and into 2019. Our projection for full-year freight-adjusted revenues for the Aggregates segment remains in line or slightly ahead of our year-beginning plan. Again, as a function of stronger shipments at a marginally lower geographic price mix. As noted, diesel prices in the first half rose more than projected. We now expect full-year diesel costs for the Aggregates segment to be approximately $15 million higher than in our year-beginning plan. Again, higher diesel prices should support higher Aggregates pricing over the longer-term. As, along with other logistics constraints, they serve to widen the economic moats around the better-located quarries. Absent the short-term impact of the rise in diesel costs, Aggregates segment gross profit for the first half was in line with plan. Aggregates segment unit profitability should improve in the second half, as expected, as the business benefits from higher volumes, solid operating disciplines and the absence of certain costs tied to hurricanes and other weather events in the prior year period. In total, full-year Aggregates segment gross profit should approximate, beginning-of-year expectations, as higher revenues offset the impact of higher diesel costs. In contrast, first half results for the Asphalt segment, trail plan in the first half and likely will remain below plan for the second half and full-year. Due primarily to the increase in liquid asphalt prices, first half results missed plan by approximately $15 million. Second half material margins, although stabilizing and improving, likely will remain below beginning-of- year projections due to higher input cost. And we expect full-year segment results will miss plan by approximately $20 million. Concrete segment results were in line for the first half and should meet plan for the full-year. Management expectations for SAG expense, interest expense, taxes and operating and maintenance CapEx remain unchanged. Taken as a whole, we continue to project full-year net earnings of between $4 and $4.65 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion. We do note that the current year impact of higher diesel and liquid AC prices may make the higher end of this range difficult to reach, despite the shipment strength we see. As Tom referenced, our midpoint expectation for full-year adjusted EBITDA supported by our bottoms up business unit projections, currently stands at $1.2 billion. Again, the business is generally performing as expected, with shipment growth better than planned and petroleum-related input cost worse than planned. Strengthening shipments to public end-users, plus improving pricing and unit margins, plus maturing growth investments should position the business very well heading into 2019 and beyond. Our overall capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, as does our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Now, I'd like to wrap up with a reminder of the fundamental strength of our franchise and aggregates-focused business model. Ours is a business that, in the last five years, has done the following. In the Aggregates segment, using trailing 12 months figures, we have compounded shipments at a 6.5% annual rate. Unit pricing has compounded at a 4.3% rate with unit costs growing at less than 1%. Unit gross profit has, as a result, compounded at nearly 13% annually. And total company adjusted EBITDA has compounded at a 20% clip. Furthermore, ours is a business with attractive cash flow dynamics. As noted last quarter, after tax cash flow from earnings, that's adjusted EBITDA, less working capital growth of $50 million, operating and maintenance CapEx of $250 million, and cash taxes of $75 million, should approximate $825 million for the year. And all of this backed by an advantaged, irreplaceable, essential asset base. And a culture centered on taking care of each other and winning the right way. And now, this business sits at another positive inflection point. With public construction activity beginning what should be a multi-year recovery backed by new, higher dedicated funding. But as great as Vulcan's business is, and you know it's a great business, it is an even better place to work and an even better team to be a part of. I will miss it deeply. But I have every confidence, every confidence, in our direction and continued success. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you, John. As you all know, this is John's last earnings call as our CFO. I want to thank John for his outstanding work as part of our senior leadership team. He has been a key player in developing and refining the fundamentals of our strategy and our business models. Working together as a closely knit team, we and our employees throughout the company are shaping a direction that has delivered and will continue to deliver great value for our shareholders, our customers, and our employees. And you can continue to count on that kind of continuity and steadiness both in strategic direction and our daily operational excellence that is a hallmark of the way we do business at Vulcan. I would like to personally thank John for his friendship and partnership and all that he has done for his Vulcan family. Thank you, John. And although I'm sad to see John moving on at the end of the year, we have had an organized smooth transition under way. Suzanne Wood, who joins us as our CFO on September 1, is an outstanding talent with deep and broad experience. She will bring her own highly-regarded leadership abilities and fresh perspectives. She will be a key member of the team that is tightly-focused on strategic growth and superior execution in all aspects of our business. That is of the utmost importance to us. It's how we go about making our company better every day. We know what we need to do to maximize the value of our asset base and our franchise. We are going to keep focused on that and on day-in and day-out execution. We are more than ready to meet the growing demand in public and private sectors. We are securing increasing business in projects of all sizes from major projects to small construction jobs, all across our footprint with particular growth in our high-margin, high-population markets. We will continue to achieve price and volume gains that further improve our superior unit margins. And we will remain keenly focused on our operational excellence and maintaining our world-class safety performance. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today will come from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Trey. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: First off, wanted to say, John, being your last call, it's been great working with you and wish you the best. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, bud. Appreciate it. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: First off, I wanted to just talk about the kind of turning the corner on cost challenges that you guys have talked about. Really, if you could just kind of go into more detail on how to think about the flow-through in the bridge to your expectations here in the back half understanding your \u2013 some of these things are behind you. But just really trying to get our head around the shift in incrementals needed to kind of get to that original Aggregates kind of go \u2013 growth \u2013 gross profit goals. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Trey, I'll start and \u2013 just with a view of the quarter in the first half, and I think Tom will comment on the full-year, and we're going to clarify as best we can. First thing we would say, as we said in the prepared remarks and in the release, is we're on plan. For the Aggregates segment, we are on our plan for the first half of the year. Albeit driven a little bit by stronger shipments than originally projected, offsetting the higher diesel cost than we had expected. But we are on our plan for the first half of the year. And in terms of flow-throughs and just the way we look at it as a management team, internally. One, always trying to take a little bit longer-term view of that number. But as we look at the first half, first, you got to look at it on a same-store basis. I'll just remind everybody, the flow-through on acquired revenue, particularly Ag U.S.A., is always going to distort those numbers. So, you got to look at it on a same-store basis. As we look at same-store flow-through the first half, we see 43%, absent the year-over-year impact in diesel, which we will overcome as we move forward and put in their own (00:22:57) pricing, that's 56%. I noted in the release, I don't want to distract anybody, but if you look at the pensionary class and what that did absent that, it's 59% to 60%. So, our main message on flow-through and on the business as a whole for the first half is that we are on plan. We also expect those flow-throughs, as we've said, I think all year long, to improve meaningfully in the second half such that the full-year number is basically in line with what you'd expect from our beginning-of-year guidance, of course, and at or slightly above that 60% long-term number. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Trey, in the second half, we will definitely see flow-through improvement and it's really driven by three things. Number one, prices will continue to rise. Our backlog pricing is much higher. You've got fuel offset in that. And also we're just simply working off our work. We've got some work we're working off right now that's one or two years old and is priced out long ago. Then, second, we'll see significant cost improvements. First piece of that is we've moved past the old storm-related and some of the transportation costs that we saw last year and we saw in the first half of the year. The second piece of that is we'll reap the benefit and not the cost of the first half improvements we did in some big plants that we took down in preparation for the season. And the third thing is, you're just going to see that volume growth continue and it's really driven by the big jump in public demand. So, I think we're confident in how we did in the first half and how it sets us up in the second half. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And then, Trey, if you wanted to square \u2013 and others, if you want to square the guidance for the year and just taking a look at the total business and kind of how we get there, again, this is all consistent with our plan. We're looking for about $160 million of profit improvement in the second half year-over-year. And again, if the question is how do you get there, here's the way we look at it. We've got significant benefit in the second half from acquisitions, about $30 million year-over-year that's mostly Ag U.S.A. We've got, as you know, significant operating cost and margin improvement in the Aggregates segment in the second half. Again, we're comping over a bunch of storm-related cost in the second half that shouldn't repeat, that's about another $30 million to $35 million. We've got approximately 10 million more tons in the second half of this year on a same-store basis than we had in the second half of last year. That drives its own benefit at a strong flow-through way. As Tom mentioned, we've got higher pricing in the second half than a year ago. That's probably another $40 million of benefit year-over-year on the second half. We'll have a little bit of contribution from the downstream businesses, not a lot year-over-year given the headwinds in our Asphalt segment. And SAG, that's slightly up in the second half over the prior year, maybe $5 million, but largely flat. So, look, our plan is basically intact. We're kind of following the exact plan we had at the beginning of the year. Only difference is really being higher aggregates shipments driven by stronger public shipments, which is fantastic, offsetting higher than anticipated diesel costs and helping offset what will be a full-year miss in our Asphalt segment. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right. That's super helpful. Thank you for that. And then, second one for me is just around a lot of the noise out there around SB1. Obviously, a lot of chatter, possibility for repeal, obviously, on the ballot for November. Just trying to get maybe your updated thoughts around how we should be thinking about that or how that could shake out. I mean, understanding you guys don't have a crystal ball either but some of the polls that we see look like \u2013 could be pretty much a coin toss at this point. But as you guys know, these polls can sometimes be a little bit deceiving depending on sample size and the population there. So, really just trying to get any updated thoughts you guys might have around SB1 from where you sit today. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, I think your opening comment about SB1 was completely accurate. There is a lot of noise, and there will continue to be noise for the next four months about it. But let's kind of step back on and look at the facts as we know it in California. And I would point out four things. Number one, remember, California is the fifth largest economy in the world. And it's also got some of the country's worst roads. Number two, California voters understand how bad the roads are and of all \u2013 they've already supported 20 local initiatives that increase transportation funding, we saw that year-and-a-half ago. And fact number three, as you know, SB1 was firewalled for transportation uses only in June which is very good for us and also removes the biggest argument for repeal. And fact four, SB \u2013 you've got to remember, SB1 has incredibly broad and deep support in the state. So, those are facts if we'd go on (00:28:16) California (00:28:17) don't forget three other points. Remember, Caltrans is already moving. So, by November, they will have already collected an additional $4.7 billion for highway construction. And those local initiatives that I mentioned earlier, they will raise $50 billion over the life of the initiatives. Fact number three, remember, Vulcan shipments and prices to the public market in California are going to be higher the second half of this year. They'll be higher than that in 2019, and they'll be higher than that in 2020 given our current pipeline and backlogs. So, our success in California is enhanced by SB1 but it's not dependent on SB1. Look, we have a fantastic position in the fifth largest economy in the world. Our backlogs are higher, our \u2013 the pricing on those backlogs are higher than they've been in years and they're accelerating and that price momentum which was very good in first half of the year will continue to grow balance of this year and into next year and into 2020. So, again, our success in \u2013 we're going to be successful in California. SB1 will only enhance that. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right. Thanks for the thoughts, Tom, and good luck. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Jerry. Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Good morning. This is Ben Burud on for Jerry. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just wanted \u2013 morning. Just wanted to start and get some more color on pricing in light of such strong shipment growth. So, double-digit volume growth in the quarter. Can you kind of help reconcile that strength with 3% clean pricing? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. So, pricing momentum is good and improving. If you take a closer look at our individual markets, we're actually where we thought we'd be. It's really 3% or 4%. 80% of our markets that we're in, had prices in the 3% to 4% range. And we've been raising prices all along. So, as we work our whole work, we'll see it replaced with higher price jobs. Some of that \u2013 the mix are very similar prices that we're working on today are priced one or two years ago. As we always, say rising transportation cost is good for pricing in our economic moat, same thing for diesel. And when we're quoting higher prices over \u2013 because of those things right now. And this will keep building the second half of the year, our booking and backlogs or higher prices. Remember, accelerating volumes are very good for pricing. Public work is driving improved volumes and prices. And I'll give you a couple of examples like this. So, in the first half of this year, we've seen California, Virginia and Georgia up mid- to high-single digits. So, the pricing is coming. And it's \u2013 and you see it across the vast majority of our markets. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I mean, can we just remind a number of you that it's not atypical at all for us to have a six-month lag on average between when we quote something and when we ship it. It obviously varies by job type. But six months on average isn't way off. So, a lot of what we shipped in the second quarter this year, we quoted and booked in Q3 and Q4 last year. So, when we referenced improving pricing in our backlogs and when you've heard us talk in Q1, I think pretty clearly and obviously in this call pretty clearly about the direction we have as a company on pricing, and the fact that that's only reinforced by strength in public, you're going to see that come with a lag. So, what you're saying is good for pricing in the second half, but it is equally good for pricing in 2019. And look, this is a business that's compounded pricing through the recovery so far our business at almost 4.5%. Pricing comp is probably only improving in total, some periods higher, some periods lower. Mix is going to affect it in a given quarter. But don't lose sight over the power of the business model. None of that has changed and really has a whole another push from these higher logistics costs, which widened the economic moats around our quarries. So, I hope you can tell it's not something that we're overly concerned with on this. And we see it as something that's actually be quite positive for the business moving forward. Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, in California, you gave us pricing up 7% year-over-year. Could you help \u2013 give us an idea of how shipments were in the quarter? And then, related to that, if you think of SB1 as we head into the end of the year and maybe people \u2013 who knows \u2013 maybe some people get cold feet. Is there any pull forward into late 2018 in what was supposed to be beginning in 2019? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. So, I mean, if you look at the shipments for the year, we're just a little ahead of where we were prior year in the quarter, they were down. Now, all of that is timing of how we work in California. As we said, we had a strong first quarter. The private demand in California continues to be solid. The second half, its growth is some private but a lot of that is public flow-through. If you look at our backlogs, both in volume and price in California are up where we should be. We don't see a lot of SB1 in 2019. It'll really be in 2020 and beyond. But, in spite of that, in 2019, our backlogs will support the volumes that we're projecting the second half. So \u2013 and, as I said in my comment about SB1, remember, Caltrans will have already collected additional $4.7 billion by November and you've got the impact of the local funding of an additional $1.35 billion. So, there's a lot of increased funding in California and I think we feel good about it. As I said, about \u2013 when I was talking about SB1, (00:34:26) second half of this year, we feel good about 2019, and that'll grow into 2020. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And again, just to be clear, I mean, we're super excited about what Caltrans is doing. It's just we don't expect it to show up in our shipments in 2018 and that's always been our view that's not a change. So, anything that happens there is effectively upside but very good for 2019. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: The shipment strength we saw in the quarter just as a reminder, came without help from California, without help from Virginia, without help from Georgia. Many of our higher priced markets, all those markets are super healthy long-term. Just some timing issues there in the quarter. And you're going to see good growth in all those areas in the second half. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: We have full flavor on Caltrans. And they really \u2013 like John said, they've done a good job. I mean, we've already backlogged 1 million tons of aggregate off of SB1 funding and about 300,000 tons of asphalt. This is really early in the game. I would not expect to see much of that in 2018. It will be 2019 and 2020. Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll hear from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Morning, Kathryn. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Hi. Morning. Thank you for taking my questions today. Still on the policy vein, wanted to shift coast and go to Georgia, Texas, Florida, Tennessee, and North Carolina, which we in our work have seen some better lettings in the first half of 2018. Given strong lettings, obviously, there can be a delay between the dollars and lettings which we saw last year. But also, possibly, wanted to get a little bit more color of, now that we've seen good lettings numbers out of those key states, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of work flow-through and also what you're seeing in lettings going into 2019 based on the early read from this year? Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think that we're seeing a turn in a lot of markets. When I say a turn, it is in, really, a turn in profitability driven by volume and price. And that turn is also \u2013 the catalyst for that turn is the turn in public work. And I'll talk about three markets where we've seen a big turn there. The first one would be coastal Texas, and we saw a big turn in coastal Texas probably in the last six, eight months. We had a downturn there. It's recovered. The private side is recovering. There's good highway work. Our volumes are dramatically up. You're seeing prices \u2013 actually, prices in the second quarter rose over prices in the first quarter, and they'll continue to rise through the year. And all of that's driving marked improving profitability in coastal Texas. And that's without the impact of the energy work that you're hearing out there. There's dozens of energy jobs and billions of dollars that are in the planning stages. We don't expect to see that until 2019 and 2020. And then behind that, you're going to see, in 2019 and 2020, you'll start to see non-highway infrastructure pull through, with Harvey projects that are in the design stages right now. Those \u2013 I could \u2013 I think there's 30 of those in pre-planning process. So, very exciting in coastal Texas. Turning now from there to Tennessee, particularly Nashville, is a great example, Kathryn, where that has been a very healthy state for a long time. But we actually \u2013 the Tennessee DOT has done an excellent job already pulling through improved ag projects. That's a state where those \u2013 some of those projects will hit this year. And with that turn in public, you've also \u2013 again, you've got the \u2013 you have the price and the volume flowing through in Tennessee. The last one I'd mention is a state that's been hot for a while, Florida. DOT is really solid private, really solid public. You're starting to see infrastructure \u2013 not how we infrastructure flow-through in Florida but with the big public work maturing in Florida, you get a better mix. So, actually, our overall profitability and our unit profitability is getting better with the volume and mix. And you could go on and on and on across the country, wherever the funding is, has \u2013 is starting to mature. And as we always talk about, you'll see a layering effect of that over the next three or four years. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : (00:38:50) John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And Kathryn, just to walk you out, I mean, I know you understand all this actually quite well. But from inside our shop, in each of those markets and others, there's a turn not just in volume but also in profitability, as Tom said, and in pricing. So, if you took coastal Texas, and we've talked a lot about that over the last year, given the hurricane impacts and those kind of things. Again, that's turning in volume and you know very well the DOT outlook, you know the Harvey Relief Fund outlook, you know the recovery in private, you know the energy projects. All of which give great visibility. That's a market where, in the first half, we would have had \u2013 the way we measure it on a freight-adjusted basis , down pricing. That freight headwind to the way we report pricing is going to reverse. And on top of that, our overall pricing is moving up. So, if you looked at kind of down pricing first half, you'd see up pricing in the last month to give you a feel. So, that's a really good story moving forward. Same kind of dynamic of the places. You had asked about Georgia in your question. We really like what we see in Georgia. Of course, still some issues with capacity constraints, really, logistics constraints, I should say. Not ours, but the markets. In particular some rail issues there, that's one place that's been affecting us. But the outlook on public and just the backlog of work to be done bodes, again, really well for the second half. Continued pricing; pricing in that market has been very strong and, again, strength into 2019. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Kathryn, Georgia. A little bit of good news in Georgia. Over top of all the DOT funding that has been growing in the state, we also starting to see some local initiatives particularly in South Georgia right in the middle of where all the Ag U.S.A. rail yards are. It's about $0.5 billion that will flow-through. Again, that will take a while, but we're pleased. We're very pleased with that in light of what's going on with Ag USA. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : That's helpful. Tagging on to your commentary on pricing. For the second half, you've already commented a bit in the Q&A just about the flow-through of pricing and how it takes time. But just to be really clear on that 2% to 3% guide for the year, is that on a freight-adjusted or non-freight-adjusted basis because one would imply an acceleration of pricing trends in the second half while the other would imply a deceleration of trends, and just a quick clarification on that point? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: First of all... Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : And then also \u2013 Go ahead. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: No, first of all, that would be \u2013 I'm sorry to interrupt you. That is freight-adjusted. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: And we would tell you that will accelerate not just in the second half but through the second half and into 2019. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Perfect. And then, finally, in the \u2013 you might have already answered this in terms of the incremental margin question. But just to be clear, following up on a question we've had for the past few quarters on the incremental margins. Any impact on how Aggregates USA impacted the incremental margin calculation? And are there any other items that we should take into consideration that won't happen in the second half of the year like the Houston dredging cost, like the Panamax ship and like the weather concept perhaps wasn't outlined earlier? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think John covered that in a little \u2013 very \u2013 in his first remark on pricing on flow-throughs. But we won't face a lot of the storm challenges that we faced in 2018 \u2013 in, excuse me, 2017. And we said that it would take us through the second quarter to get those behind us. That includes dredging, that includes some of the other transportation costs we had and on top of that, our new ships are now in place and shipping. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Great. Thank you so much. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Kathryn in the quarter. In the quarter, the \u2013 again, just, we had, as you know, we called it out $7-plus-million of diesel headwind. Again, we'll catch up on that on pricing, helps our pricing. We have a little bit less than $10 million of elevated distribution costs that should not repeat in the second half that hit the quarter. But again, as we get into the second half, and I know you're all familiar of what we're comping over in terms of the difficulties we had with last year storms. But we should have $30 million to $35 million of cost improvement year-over-year in the second half. Some of that is cost from last year second half not repeating. Some of that is the fact that our own internal plans has some costs front-loaded in the first half. I think we called that out in Q1, for example. And then, of course, as Tom mentioned, we get the benefit of higher operating leverage or stronger volumes in the second half. So, despite the new headwind, we should see our unit cost improve markedly and our flow-throughs improve markedly in the second half. All on the same-store basis is really the way to look at. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Right. Well, thank you very much for answering my questions today. Good luck. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Kathryn. Our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you. John, best of luck. It was a pleasure working with you over the last several years. First question was on \u2013 a follow-up on the incremental margin outlook and the discussion around 60% in the long-term, and I think coming into the year with an expectation of 65% to 70% because of some of these one-time items that you talked about that occurred last year that's not occurring this year. Just want to be clear on the incremental, though. Does the view of improving incremental margins factor in the rise in diesel costs or should we expect that 60% to, I guess, 70% incremental moving forward to be if you strip out diesel? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think that the second half incremental takes into account the increase in diesel cost. I think that that's built in. What we've told you, it is a headwind, but it continues to be less and less of a headwind as the year goes along. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Garik, in the second half, we're probably expecting diesel of around \u2013 it varies by market \u2013 but around $2.60. So, obviously, there's some uncertainty around that. We'll kind of see how it plays out. But, keep in mind, we've got basically stronger volumes offsetting diesel impact in the Aggregates segment. So, full-year, our expectation for the Aggregates segment is darn close to what it was at the beginning of the year. Slightly different way of getting there. We do expect to have a headwind from our Asphalt segment due liquid AC costs relative to our beginning-of-year expectations. But when we sit at the end of the year and look backwards, we expect a flow-through rate in our Aggregates segment that's really not that different than what we've expected at the beginning of the year. And again, I'd just caution anybody, looking at just flow-throughs on a quarterly basis, they going \u2013 they swing a lot. So, you got to take a bit of a longer-term view. And I would remind that by the time we finish this year, we're going to look back over the previous five years and we're going to find out that our flow-through rate for five years have been about 62% or something. So, pretty much in line with long-term expectation. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, got it. And just follow-up question on volumes. You called out California and Virginia as being lighter in the quarter, should rebound due to timing but these are also markets that saw stronger price growth. And then, conversely, you had stronger volume growth in some lower priced markets. So, just it begs a question around market share, some of these higher pricing markets, have you seen a share shift and how should we expect or contemplate market share over the next several quarters in some of these stronger markets? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I don't know that we would \u2013 or that I would call that as a share shift. Based on it was really where those shipments where and look, for example, in Alabama and Arizona, those are driven by very large highway projects that we booked some time back. And so, I think the impact is really \u2013 of those two, is timing of big projects, same thing was impacting California, and Virginia was weather. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Got it. Thanks. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Garik, I don't know if it's what you're \u2013 if it's exactly what you're asking, but the kind of mix impact we had on recorded average selling prices this quarter, we would expect to be fairly transitory. I mean you know this, it's that our higher price markets are the ones that have higher long-term growth. So, longer-term, if anything, mix should probably help us a teeny bit. But in the quarter, we had a set of markets that \u2013 by the way, they all grew. So, 80% of our markets that had growth around \u2013 had pricing growth around 4%, they grew at 9%, we just had some of the lower price markets like Illinois, Alabama, Arizona grow at a higher rate. They all grew, but we just had a little more growth in markets that on average, have prices, $5 \u2013 $4 or $5 below the higher price markets. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today will comes from Rohit Seth with SunTrust. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. My question's on transportation cost. I mean how much of a headwind was the distribution cost in the quarter? And I heard you say that the headwind was behind us. Can you just provide some color on some of the basis for that? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, it was two things. We had talked about the \u2013 our port in Houston that was silted in from the hurricanes. We suffered from that second half of last year, we got that dredged in the first quarter. The two things, you have the cost of \u2013 excuse me, got it dredged in the second quarter. There were two pieces of that cost. Number one, you got the cost of dredging; number two, in the first and second quarter, you're still going into the light loads and partial ships which is very inefficient. And then, we had some \u2013 still had some barge costs go up and down the Mississippi that we were fighting. And I will tell you that, as we said, those costs are behind us and we feel really good and really confident about how we enter the third quarter. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'm talking more about the trucking-related cost to your distribution yard \u2013 sales yards, sorry. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I don't think that's what we were referring to when we talked about that. We were really referring to more of the Blue Water than trucking costs. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: The biggest place we had elevated distribution costs related to our businesses, and this is in the quarter, related to our businesses in the Gulf Coast of Texas. So, I think, Houston and along the rest of the Gulf Coast. That's really where we saw most of our elevated distribution costs in the quarter. We have higher trucking costs, but again, given that we report freight-adjusted pricing and other factors, that's less of an issue in the numbers that you see. I would note, it's a little bit of a different topic, but just on the Ag U.S.A. outlook, and what I mentioned on rail there, in terms of distribution headwinds and logistics headwinds, for that business, we still see a $50 million EBITDA contribution for the year. But that would have been higher if we had the kind of rail service we'd like to see. We're probably full-year looking at being nearly 500,000 tons below what we would have otherwise been in that business. So, if anyone's wondering why we're not raising our outlook for Ag U.S.A., like you might expect, that's really the issue. We're super happy with the acquisition, still going to contribute $50 million as we laid out. But going to take slightly longer to capture some of those synergies that we would have hoped to have captured this year due to the challenges we're facing in rail service. Now, we think those will get worked out, but still a bit of a challenge. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: To your point on truck \u2013 on trucking, usually that adjusts very fast. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, on your guidance, you said in the full-year guidance, your \u2013 you think the top end is less achievable. Can you just maybe provide some direction whether you're tracking towards a low end or the midpoint? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We would say, we're tracking to the midpoint. And again, not trying to set off any alarm bells or anything, just trying to be realistic. We've got a $20 million hole in our Asphalt segment relative to our beginning-of-year expectations. We've got diesel headwinds relative to beginning-of-year expectations of, let's call it, $15 million. And to reach the equivalent of what would have been $1.275 million (00:52:00) even with stronger shipments is just tough. So, it's not that it's impossible, given the shipment strength we see. We just wanted to be realistic and tell you that the high end of the range, the $1.250 million (00:52:13), given those headwinds in diesel and in our Asphalt segment economics, it does get a little bit tougher. And so, to be clear, we really didn't want you all to take the strength in our shipments, which is very real and powerful, and just move right to the high end of our range, because those headwinds we've seen in diesel and in liquid asphalt, so far, are a real thing. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, are you seeing any project delays in any of your key markets? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Every one of them is different. I think with California, we saw some that may be a little bit delayed, but they'll come on this year. We've seen \u2013 continue to see some \u2013 they're not delayed, but there was slower shipping on the 85-400 job in Georgia. But, actually, they have gotten approval and that has cranked back up. So, for the most part, we're in where we thought we'd be as far as timing of jobs, and in some places, probably a little ahead with them people trying to push new funding through. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So, no project delays and no trucking logistics headwinds. That's what I'm hearing? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: With the exception of California, and we talked about that moving from Q2 into Q3 and Q4, I think that's probably accurate. Now, I'm sure there are some projects out there where we'll \u2013 I don't know what goes on in every one of them, but for the most part, I think that's an accurate statement. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We had some... Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And your capital allocation... John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We had some delays in the first half like 285-400 but that's \u2013 I wouldn't let that be too big a distraction. When you get back to guidance range, I would remind you and everybody, we're shipping more than 900,000 tons a day right now. So, it doesn't take a lot to ship a couple million dollars from one quarter to another, and that's just something we should all be aware of. Just so we don't mistake short-term stuff for the underlying health of the business. Just, you can think about that math. But if you were asking the question, why our range is still as wide as it is, that's really a big driver of it. And where we would, we're able to get the work done as evidenced by our shipment growth rate in the second quarter. But if we had a big major disruption like another hurricane event, it does take longer to catch up. That's really where we're seeing some of these trucking constraints and logistics constraints come into play. Is if you get a big massive disruption, it does take a little bit longer to catch up. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, final question, your capital allocation priorities, and \u2013 is there any potential here for a share buyback? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think those \u2013 our priorities really haven't changed. And we've talked about those a lot, but when \u2013 that's \u2013 we'll always look at that. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think, obviously, we take a lot of factors into consideration, and certainly, share price is one. But as we've been doing, we will make those decisions and report them out in the following quarter. Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: All right. Thank you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We remain very committed to our investment-grade credit rating. We would expect to finish this year in a leverage ratio within our 2% to 2.5% range. So, I'm not telling you what we'll do or not do, but there are multiple factors of which the share price is one. Operator : Does that answer your question? Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Moving along, we'll take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, thanks for... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on \u2013 just two-part question around some of the diesel issues. And just, A is, just a little more clarity around timing of what the guide assumes for new diesel surcharges or other price hikes. And second, I guess, related to your comment about the implied economic moat. What are you seeing around \u2013 like are you guys tightening up your shipping radiuses? Are you seeing competitors tighten up shipping radiuses as a way of combating the diesel? And how's that kind of affecting the local market dynamics if at all? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Let me take the diesel first. And as I said earlier on pricing, we're already pricing up to offset diesel costs. And those are our production costs and how it affects the quarries themselves. So, that's already happening, it'll take a little while to flow-through. As John said, a lot of times that takes six months for work to \u2013 once you book it to port to ship. As far as the moats are concerned, what drives the moats is just increased freight costs for someone to come closer to you. And it just allows you to \u2013 as when you price, so let's say, five miles away two years ago versus today, that moat got wider and your prices go up. So, that's kind of as simple as that. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And I guess, just relating to that, though, more specifically, if you've seen kind of competitive activity already be affected by that in some of your key markets? Is that enabling some of the stronger growth that you're seeing just effectively less competition in certain markets? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: No. I think there's plenty of competition in all of our markets. The moat really affects price. And I think that \u2013 but also, you've got to remember, and this kind of goes back to the fundamentals of price increases, is visibility to coming work is really \u2013 underscores and underpins price increases. And that's just not in the Aggregates business. That's from contracting Asphalt, Concrete, the whole \u2013 across the whole construction change, that's really what drives the price. And as those \u2013 as that public demand has joined in, that is very clear, there's no question that that's coming, and it allows people to \u2013 more confidence in raising prices. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And my second question just relates, and sorry to harp on price a bit here, but... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: It's all right. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : ...I'm just trying to understand the second half guide and you guys talked about it a couple of different ways as far as what the true like-for-like pricing is. And so I think, throughout that, it was 3% to 4%, and 80% of your market. So, when we're looking at the price guide for the second half, what would you say as far \u2013 is the mix impact in the geographic mix impact in your second half pricing commentary? Is it the same, has that \u2013 is it diminishing as some of those, like the California markets, come back just trying to get at really what the underlying change is there? John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: The way I think about it is, to try and cut to the chase, we obviously build this bottom up as we look at it. So, I don't know that you'll see exactly the same kind of mix impact that you saw in the second quarter overtime, but we'll continue at this rate of growth. And we're growing shipments 10-plus-percent as we did in the second quarter. When you have that kind of rate of growth, you're a little bit, just as a mathematical definition, a little more prone to mix shifts. So, good, bad, sideways. So, I wouldn't try and read too much of that. To help you, we're expecting in the second half year-over-year price improvements in that 3% to 4% range, in that range of about $0.40 a ton on a same-store basis. Just to give you a rough ballpark. And what I'd really underscore is continued further improvement in our quoted pricing which will further benefit late this year and into 2019. So, there'll be more momentum probably in our quoted work than you see on our shift work, per Tom's comments. But think something on the order of $0.40, 3-ish percent, 3%, 4% in the mix. It's going to be what it is. We don't try and \u2013 the last thing in the world you'd ever want us to try and do is to avoid shipments in order to improve the average selling price. So, I hope that helps, but it's a positive story. And it's an acceleration, not a deceleration. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think, important to note, we're pushing prices across all geographies, across all product lines. And so, when you \u2013 and so John said, when you talk about a mix effect, what happened in the second quarter, nothing \u2013 there's nothing bad with that. In fact, it's healthy and good. We simply sold more product in markets like Alabama, Arizona than we expected. That's a really good thing. And as you look at it, we're always going to maximize all the products in all geographies at the best price and margin possible. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We don't mind if you ask any questions, you're not going to ask any questions any harder than Tom's asking the operator. So... Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful, guys. And certainly clear in terms of your conviction on the way forward so thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today will come from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Morning, Adam. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, one more on price. I'm sorry, but are you \u2013 would you say you're the pricing leader out in the market or are you seeing others push major (01:01:51) prices also? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: (01:01:55) I think that what you're seeing with pricing is pretty widespread, that's what we're about. And, again, I'll go back. That volume confidence and the visibility to, particularly to the public work coming in, is very good for pricing and that's good for pricing across the construction material segment, whether that's contracting Asphalt, Concrete, and all Aggregate product lines. So, it's pretty widespread and that is really healthy and it's pretty consistently moving up in the vast majority of our markets. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And the dynamics vary a lot market by market. Though, I think people will tell you, we typically play a price and value leadership role over time. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, I wanted to ask about \u2013 we've seen a lot of \u2013 year-to-date, we've seen a lot of multiple compression for these Aggregates names. Maybe people worrying about the cycle getting long in the tooth. I mean, are you guys seeing any signs that were late cycle instead of something else? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think if you look at where we are in normalized demand across most of our markets, we're still well below it. If you look at the underpinning drivers of demand, the private side, both res and non-res continues to be healthy. What we had suffered with and last year was the lack of flow-through of highway work, as we've talked a lot about that's really pulling through. The thing that we've yet to see is the flow-through of non-highway infrastructure. I would tell you, we're on the cusp of that. We're starting to see that today in places like Florida, as it catches up to what's going on in the growth in res and non-res and that will be exciting to see. So, it's a much smaller segment of ours. But \u2013 so, at this point, in the vast majority of our markets, we see steady, continued growth particularly with the onset of public demand. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: We're well more than 50 million tons short, a little bit more than that of where we would expect to be in this cycle, our views on that have not changed. The numbers I gave earlier, about just the amazing performance of this business, this franchise through the recovery so far. It's about half way through the recovery in terms of tonnage in our Ag segment. And again, I think most people on this call understand that's still more than another 50 million tons below peak volumes from the asset base we have today. So, we, like others in the industry, would still see a multiple-year recovery ahead. And one that allows for really good compounding of unit margin improvements through time. Which I think \u2013 certainly, we, but I think many others in our marketplace are very, very focused on. Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys, and good luck, John. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. You're expecting... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : ...double-digit volume growth in the second half, which is certainly a nice acceleration. And it sounds like you're expecting good momentum heading to next year. So, just curious, how should we think about the growth trajectory going into 2019 and is this pace sustainable? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'd look at it this way. I think going to 2019 \u2013 and we've talked a lot about this \u2013 the private side continues to be healthy, particularly in our markets. What you'll \u2013 and we've talked about this a lot. I think what you're going to see is that compounding effect on the highway demand as funds mature and that's compounding within a state like Georgia as the DOTs mature and are able to get work out, and they're not going to wait on one job to finish to probably put another one out. And then, you'll see the compounding effect between states. So, places like Georgia or Texas or Florida which have very, very good growing highway programs will be complemented with the onset of maturing DOTs and money flowing through shipments in places like South Carolina, Tennessee, and California. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And while it's too early for us to give any specific numbers on 2019, in our markets, we like the steady growth we see in residential. As we all know, that's \u2013 there's plenty of demand. That's really still a supply-constrained marketplace. For our markets and our business, we still like what we see in private non-res, just what we're booking in our backlogs. We always keep an eye on that marketplace. It has got the benefit of some of those energy projects that Tom mentioned as we look to 2019. The highway transportation Tom just talked about, that's a really good outlook for multiple years. And we've actually just recently begun to see, and it's very early, but the first signs, really, the first signs of some improvement in what we call non-transportation public infrastructure, water systems, airport systems, schools, other things like that. And so, it'd be very encouraging if we see that continue. That's really been a laggard in the recovery so far. So, a very positive outlook. Again, we don't think we'll run into capacity constraints relative to our shipment plan for this year. We'll need to keep an eye on that. Could we sustain growth at this quarter's 11% all the way through the recovery? Somewhere in some markets, we'll run into some capacity constraints. But again, as others have said, aren't ours, but just relate to largely logistics or our contracting customers. We've been very encouraged, and you've heard Tom say, and we pointed out what's been happening with construction employment. So, I would say, keep in mind, at least as it relates to Vulcan markets that for this last two-year period where we had disappointing public shipments relative to expectations, everybody saw the same expectations and they continued with construction hiring in our markets. So, that's \u2013 some of that capacity issue is a little bit alleviated right now because of the hiring pattern we've seen in our markets over the last two years. Operator : And it looks like we did lose our caller. We'll take our next question in queue from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Morning, guys. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Morning, Stanley. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you for fitting me in. Hey, quick question. All else being equal when we think about kind of the mix impacts you've thus far this year, looking into next year, given what you see in your backlogs and the quoting activity, is regional mix a positive or a negative, kind of thinking about those expectations? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'd kind of go a little bit back to mix. As long as you're selling increased volumes in any market, is always good because you're just adding more margin to the bottom line. And as always, we do those from the bottom up. It's way too early for us to tell where we are. If you look at what's going on with highway programs in markets like, I mentioned Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, California, those are all very good margin markets and play into our strength. So, I think it really boils down to margins. And so, you see the volumes going up, that can only help cost particularly on the private side \u2013 I mean, on the public side because it's a better mix of how \u2013 you have better sales mix with that and it matches your production mix better. So, that helps price as does the volume \u2013 helps cost as does the volume, we've talked a lot about price, you put all that together and it's really why we're so excited for the second half of this year and 2019 because those margins will just grow. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: And still I think cost one (01:10:00) is really the main one, which is it doesn't really matter economically. That's, by far, the most important point. But from a headline reported number, as we get into next year and we put a slide in here and the stuff that you can see, Stanley. But you know that Alabama and Illinois, which grew 14% in the quarter in our lower price markets, those are not our fastest growing markets long-term. We've called that out over and over again. Our teams up there are doing a fantastic job running those businesses, but they don't have the same long-term visibility that almost the rest of our footprint has, at least not yet. So, and the distribution cost that affected pricing in places like coastal Texas \u2013 you heard Tom say coastal Texas is rapidly turning in those dimensions. So, in total, we'd expect what you got next year is an easier comp in the second quarter, if you will. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, no. I think that's fair. I think that that was kind of the line of questioning. I think there's a lot of momentum in some of these other states that should help from a mix perspective. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Absolutely. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And thinking about next year, right, I mean, so if you guys are down to 2 times to 2.5 times by the end of this year. You have some of your growth CapEx rolling off in addition to what should be very strong earnings. Your \u2013 has it \u2013 is M&A still kind of at the forefront and/or maybe what are you seeing in terms of opportunities out there? And then part of it, too, kind of goes back to the repurchase piece, right, because I think that there's a disconnect seemingly with the stock with the visibility that I think you all have and then kind of what's been happening here as of late. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I would sum up M&A right now, as I usually do, with discipline but a little bit different twist. We're going to remain incredibly disciplined in terms of M&A. I think our focus right now is capturing the synergies of acquisitions that we've made. As always, we'll be very, very selective. But we're working real hard to make sure that throughout this year and 2019, we capture the synergies of the very strategic growth projects that we've entered into and make sure that we're capture \u2013 have that going into 2019. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Stanley, I think you're kind of getting more to the core of the issue. But \u2013 so, thanks for the question. You're right, growth capital \u2013 internal growth capital should be a lower number next year. We had a bump up this year, really, again, as you've heard me said before, just because some projects would have been 10-plus years in the making, it made sense to turn on right now. New quarry in California, new quarry in Texas, for example. So, our cash flow profile should continue to improve quite significantly and it creates a lot of flexibility. So, we wouldn't expect that our cap allocation priorities change at all. But there's a lot of flexibility particularly as we get into next year. And it's something that you can tell we're very focused on as a management team. We've often laughed, this is a good problem to have. And we're going to work hard every single day to keep making it a bigger problem to have. So \u2013 but our cash flow profile has benefited a lot from tax reform, it's benefited a lot from the embedded leverage in the business. You're going to continue to see some of the really good growth investments we've made over a number of years mature. So, they're not done with their contribution, they're continuing to improve. And so, again, a lot of flexibility in 2019. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect guys. Well, thank you very much. And John, best wishes to you. I'll be looking for you in five years if we get off the 62% incremental. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: All right. All right. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'm just kidding. All right, take care. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen our final question today will come from Scott Schrier with Citi. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Scott. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning and thanks for getting me in on this call. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how much of your backlog might be comprised of these delayed projects that where price a long time ago and how long we might see that for? And then, I guess, as you think about, right now, we might have the propensity with labor for some more project delays, what kind of measures do you take to account for the potential for delays and pricing mechanisms for the future in your current bidding? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I would point out, we've got a number of very large projects that we're shipping. I don't know if they've been delayed now. At this point, we're shipping most of those. They'll ship throughout this year, may have a little bit go into 2019. But what's really important is the work you're bringing on is at much higher prices. And so, that mix will flow out over time. It will take balance of this year probably a little bit into 2019 to do that. But everything you're adding on is at higher prices. And we like the way that flows go and you can see it our backlogs and you can \u2013 it supports our plan for the second half of 2018. As far as labor constraints, we don't have any labor constraints. John talked a little bit about this year \u2013 about this earlier where we saw our customers with volumes basically flat, grow their labor over the last two years, and they're reaping the benefit of that. If I had to weigh that, I would say, the private, which is more labor-intensive, could have some constraints. The public shipments, which are coming on strong, I don't see those constraints, not that they're not there to catch up, but on a day-to-day basis, unless you have, as John said, a big event. John also mentioned logistics with some headwinds, with rail and potential some trucking at times. But we think those are getting fixed. We got to work through them. But \u2013 so, pricing, as we've talked about, continues to flow through at higher levels. And I don't see a big impact on labor unless, as John said, we have an event and you're playing catch up. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then, last question. On Illinois, which obviously has been a challenging market and it looks like you lumped it together with Alabama on that slide to show pretty significant year-on-year growth. And to John's point that you don't think that maybe that's going to be sustained. I'm just curious, was this quarter an anomaly or do you see some better growth or just the demand environment in Illinois? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think what you see in Illinois is a big project work, really driven by airport and toll ways. But we have some good backlogs to that. We will see some continues with that. The problem with Illinois is the DOT is obviously grossly underfunded and has issues with state budgeting as funding and has funding issues. So, with the exception of big projects which I think our folks have done a good job and is right in our wheelhouse, the fundamentals there are tough. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for that. And, John, best of luck to you. John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom for any additional or closing remarks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. Thank you all for joining us today. As you can tell, we're very pleased to see public demand kick in and our highway really kick off. We're seeing the benefit of that and we'll see it for years to come. We talked a lot about pricing. That jump in demand is driving price increases. And as time goes on, we'll continue to see that. All of this, coupled with really disciplined cost, disciplines and enhancements will drive margins. We're exactly where we thought we'd be right now in the year and we're on track for our full-year guidance. And we look forward to talking to you throughout the third quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in our company. I'm very pleased to have Suzanne Wood on the call today. Suzanne joined us as our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in early September and has quickly proved to be a strong addition to our senior leadership team. Welcome, Suzanne. Let me get right to the notable things about the quarter. We saw strong Aggregates shipments underpinned by growing public demand, and in the face of bad weather, our operating disciplines were extremely good, and I'm proud of our peoples' execution. Aggregates pricing continue to march higher. This coupled with our disciplined cost control resulted in same-store unit profitability increasing 8% to $5.45 per ton. We achieved a 15% same-store increase in gross profit, while delivering same-store flow-through of incremental Aggregates revenue of 65%. The extreme bad weather we experienced was and is a short-term disruption. These disruptions have had no long-term impact on underlying demand, on pricing dynamics, or on flow-through of incremental revenue to gross profit. The third quarter bodes well for the future. Prices continue to escalate. With improved flow-throughs, all of which is supported by growing demand. Total revenues increased by 13%, reflecting growth in Aggregates volumes and Aggregates selling prices. All of this contribute to a 65% increase in net earnings and a 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA. We obviously had extreme wet weather from \u2013 and flooding in the Carolinas and Virginia from Hurricane Florence and Tropical Storm Gordon caused record rain days in Dallas and San Antonio. We believe the severe weather negatively affected third quarter results with a loss of some 2.5 million tons of Aggregates and related flooding costs. We estimate that the pre-tax loss due to weather to be approximately $27 million in the quarter. Now, I'd like to move on to the core drivers of profitability in the business, ex-weather. We continue to see growth in private demand, but we're really excited about the strengthening public sector. Highway construction demand is strengthening across the country, but much more so in our markets. We're now seeing the conversion of public funding in the shipments, and this showed up in 10% growth in our quarterly Aggregates shipments and a 6% on a same-store basis. While these are strong growth numbers, they're particularly strong given the severe weather we experienced. However, we are still below normalized demand levels, much less the next peak. As we've said all along this year, price increases will continue to climb throughout the year and throughout 2019. Average selling prices in the quarter, adjusted for mix, rose more than 3% on a year-over-year basis, and approximately 50 basis points over the second quarter. As we look at our booking pace and backlogs, we will continue to see good upward trends in pricing. Our discussions with customers on price increases for 2019 are encouraging. Our preliminary view is that the pricing will improve mid-single-digit in 2019, reflecting the positive momentum we're seeing today. Turning to same-store cost and flow-throughs, our freight-adjusted unit cost per sales declined 2%. This cost leverage and other operating efficiencies more than offset a 28% increase in diesel fuel and operating inefficiencies caused by bad weather. Again, we're very pleased with the way our operating discipline has enabled solid improvement in unit gross profit, despite difficult conditions. Regarding outlook for the fourth quarter, we would expect three things; one, shipment growth similar to that of the third quarter; two, prices to continue improving; and three, we expect the operating disciplines you saw in the third quarter to continue, allowing for over 60% flow-through, consistent with our long-term trends. Given what we accomplished in the third quarter and how things are going in the fourth quarter, we've set ourselves up well for 2019, and here is why. I am pleased with underlying demand growth and corresponding volume growth, driven by growing public demand in our markets. And as we approach 2019, our DOTs continue to pull tax revenues into job starts, which is translating into Aggregates shipments. Our backlogs and booking pace continue to grow. The fact that pricing and our backlog and bookings continues to increase along with positive 2019 fixed plant pricing conversations, gives us confidence in the continued accelerating pricing trends into 2019. The progress we made in our operating cost execution also reinforces our confidence in realizing continuous compounding improvements in unit margin, and 60% flow-throughs in 2019 and beyond. And now, I'll turn it over to Suzanne for a more detailed review of the numbers. Suzanne? Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Let me begin by saying that I am delighted to be part of the Vulcan team. In the eight weeks that I've been on board, it's clear to me that this is a great company, a market leader with strong culture and business model. I look forward to working with Tom and others as we continue to improve our business and to sharing that progress with you. Today I'd like to cover several topics starting with an overview of third quarter results. You've heard some of the highlights from Tom, but I think a few are important enough to reemphasize. Next, I'll touch on our Aggregates flow-through of incremental revenue to gross profit and that improving trend. Third, I'll review our full-year outlook, as well as share some preliminary thoughts on 2019. And finally, I'll give a quick update on our strong balance sheet, cash flow generation, and capital allocation priorities. Now, as Tom mentioned, despite the challenges of the quarter, we realized double-digit growth in earnings. Our Aggregates shipment volume, average selling price, flow-through rate, and unit profitability improved. Shipments of Aggregates were strong in many of our key markets, and our mix-adjusted price improved both year-over-year and sequentially. Our strong same-store Aggregates flow-through rate in the quarter helped to drive gross profit per ton higher. These results demonstrate the strength of our Aggregates-focused business, even when we experienced cost pressures and wet weather. And unlike most industrial businesses, our main raw material is the rock in the ground, which is unaffected by inflation. Our operating leverage and efficiencies drive profitability by helping to offset cost pressures like diesel fuel. For example, during our third quarter, our unit cost of diesel fuel rose by 28% compared to the prior year and impacted the results by $8 million. Despite this, same-store unit cost of sales for Aggregates declined by 2%, and unit profitability increased by 8%. Now, with respect to bad weather, as Tom stated earlier, we estimate that this quarter's results were negatively affected by approximately $27 million on a pre-tax basis. As a reminder, we had about $30 million of storm-related costs in last year's third quarter. Since the impact from weather in the comparative quarters is broadly similar, the effect on this year's flow-through is not particularly significant. Our same-store flow-through target is 60% on a trailing 12-month basis. It was therefore pleasing to see our year-to-date same-store flow-through rate move up to 52%, another step in the right direction toward our goal. Given the underlying and ongoing improvement in our business, we expect continuing margin growth and unit margin improvement. We remain keenly focused on the cost control efficiencies and operating leverage that drive this flow-through number. While there are a number of things in our business that we can't control like weather, diesel prices, or the exact timing of when a large highway project starts, we can control our costs and we can drive our per-ton margin metrics higher. The next topic I'll touch on relates to our 2018 outlook and some preliminary thoughts for 2019. First, 2018, we now expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.125 billion to $1.135 billion. In our core segment, Aggregates, same-store volume growth in the fourth quarter should be similar to the level of increase experienced in the third quarter. Additionally, as Tom emphasized, there will be upward movement in pricing. Aggregates' unit profitability will continue to improve. Moving on to the Asphalt segment, we now expect full-year gross profit to be $25 million lower than the prior year as a result of liquid asphalt prices, which rose sharply again in the third quarter, up 29% versus the prior year. Average selling prices in the Asphalt segment are moving up, but will only partially offset the impact of more expensive liquid asphalt for the balance of the year. Our full-year expectation of profitability for the Concrete segment remains unchanged. And finally, the outlook for other major expense lines such as SAG expense, interest expense and DD&A expense remains unchanged. After further review of our 2018 capital spending plans, we now anticipate that operating and maintenance capital expenditure will be $225 million rather than $250 million. Our growth CapEx will reduce from $350 million to $300 million. These capital spending reductions are part of our ongoing view to reevaluate the merits and timing of the individual projects. Using these assumptions, we now expect our 2018 after-tax cash flow from earnings to be approximately $810 million. Moving on to 2019, please keep in mind that we are in the midst of our planning and budgeting process. As we have in the past, we'll provide more specific guidance when we report fourth quarter earnings, but for today, felt it would be appropriate to share some early thoughts. Tom has already commented on the attractive public and private demand picture and we anticipate mid-single digit growth in both Aggregates volume and pricing. Our views here are supported by what we're seeing both in backlogs and the pace at which we are booking new business. In conclusion, I'll address our balance sheet strength and capital allocation priorities. We are committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, strong balance sheet structure, and debt leverage between 2 times and 2.5 times EBITDA. Currently, our weighted average debt maturity is 16 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 4.5%. This debt profile, together with our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to sensibly manage our business. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged, and we will be disciplined in the use of that capital, always seeking to improve our returns and shareholder value. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks, Suzanne. I'm proud of our peoples' performance in the third quarter. They delivered impressive results under tough circumstances. We continued our sharp focus on all aspects of operational excellence, including our safety performance where our year-to-date injury rate is 0.91 per 200,000 employee hours worked, which is world-class. In the third quarter, we made solid progress toward our longer-term goals. And as we look to 2019, we're confident that we will continue to gain momentum in compounding improving price increases, and in our operating disciplines that drive cost improvements, both of which continue to grow unit margins. Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will first hear from Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Tom and Suzanne. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Trey. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: A quick question on the price acceleration that you've been seeing. I mean, you guys have been calling for that for most of the year. And here we're starting to see that come through and it sounds like that's going to continue into 2019. Can you just kind of talk about some of the drivers you're seeing there that's behind some of that acceleration? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. If you step back and look at our pricing momentum in our business, it's clearly improving. We like the continued growth that we're seeing in price increases. Now, we expect, as we talked about in the \u2013 all through the year, we expect pricing increases to continue to step up quarter-over-quarter. And you saw that between Q2 and Q3, and it's really \u2013 that's really the basis of that is the continued improvement on price increases on bid work. We can see it in our backlogs. We see it in our booking paces. And as you kind of go through the individual markets, you can watch it just inch up week-over-week, month-over-month. Now, Trey, we'll see a bigger jump in January, as most of our price increases for fixed plant work go into effect at that point. Those conversations are happening as we speak with those fixed plant customers for 2019. We're very encouraged by those conversations. The preliminary view, as we said, would be mid-single digit. Obviously, we'll give you a lot more clarity of that in February, but underpinning all of this, and we talk about this a lot, is a visibility to big and more and more public work that's coming. We're starting to ship a lot of those jobs, so people are feeling good and have confidence in the market. They have good visibility. Diesel prices and logistics costs, we're starting to overcome those and that just widens our moat. So, as we step back and look at it, our price increases are clearly moving up. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right. Thanks for that, Tom, that's helpful. And then you're looking for volume and, it sounds like, demand trends in 4Q to look similar to 3Q. Can you give us any ideas what you guys are seeing specifically in October with that at least coming close to a close here? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. I would tell you that the momentum we have had in Q3 is carrying right into Q4. I'll say it right up front, we try to be thoughtful about how many shipping days are available in Q4 to make up the postponed work from the weather in Q3. Texas continued to be wet all through October. But when the sun came out in Texas, we've shipped strong. Now the rest of the country has been very strong and it just underpins the strength of our underlying demand in our markets. When we got dry weather, we're shipping. Prices on bid work continue to move up. I think the operations execution we saw in Q3 clearly carried into October. So, we should see not only that volume momentum go into Q4, we should also carry that unit margin improvement momentum into Q4. And this really sets us up good for 2019 kind of along all those disciplines. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I'll just add a couple of comments to that on Q4. You're right, the guidance does imply an uplift of about 22% year-over-year, and obviously that's going to be driven by the things that Tom mentioned. When we looked at the volume in the quarter, it's about in line with what we experienced in the third quarter in terms of sort of 6% same-store volume in the Aggregates segment. We've got the gradual step-up in price, and we've also \u2013 we are assuming that flow-throughs will be good and unit profitability will improve. As Tom said, I think the keyword here is thoughtful. We're sitting here at the end of October talking about guidance for the full year and giving some preliminary view to next year, so we tried to really be thoughtful about the guidance we were given. We've got pretty much of October behind us. We only have one more day to go. So, any of the trends that we saw strength across the country, perhaps a little bit of wetness in Texas early in the quarter, we \u2013 or early in the month, we have already factored that into the guidance. Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that color, Suzanne. That was good. And then lastly for me and I'll pass it on is, you mentioned, Suzanne, capital spending, operating and maintenance CapEx dialing that back a little bit from $250 million to $225 million, and I think growth from $350 million to $300 million. And do you have any preliminary view, and I know there was some commentary, maybe a quarter or two ago, but just any update on how to think about those two pieces of CapEx as we look into 2019? Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Not really. I mean, we are still in the early stages of our planning and budgeting. I guess if I had to say something on a very, very preliminary basis, it would be in terms of the operating and maintenance side. That will probably be relatively in line with what you will have seen us spend this year with respect to growth CapEx. And actually \u2013 we're actually having a big roundtable discussion about that here next week, so I think it would be a little bit preliminary to give you a guide on that, other than to say that as we had indicated, we had a number of projects on line for growth spending this year. And if I had to give you a directional comment one way or the other, I would not expect it to be quite as high next year, but we'll firm that up when we give fourth quarter guidance. Does that help? Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks a lot, Suzanne. Thanks, Tom, and I'll pass it on. Look forward to seeing you guys next week. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Great. Operator : And our next question will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Jerry. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and Suzanne, welcome. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Thank you. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I wonder, Suzanne, I'd love to hear as you step up into your new role, can you just talk about the strategic priorities that you see for the organization over the next 12 months? I guess, how should we think about the opportunity set relative to the items that you're most focused on over the next year? Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, absolutely. That's a fair question and I'll try to give you a couple of examples of that. I mean, first and foremost, our strategic focus needs to be on improving our business, and when I say that to be specific that means improving our unit profitability. So all the actions you see us take with respect to pricing improvements, with respect to improving efficiencies across all of our plants with respect to any other initiatives we put in place, it's all around driving that unit profitability. And in addition to that, making sure that when we are deploying our capital, we are doing it in a very disciplined and thoughtful way to drive an appropriate return on that. So, really getting sort of into things with operations. It's something I love doing and I plan on working hard to try to help the field identify some of those unit profitability improvements and getting those into place. And then in addition to that, just making sure that all of that hard work converts into a good cash flow stream, I think is key. So, those are the priorities. I hope that's helpful and I look forward to updating you on those and talking about those as we go through the year. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Sure. I appreciate it. And then in terms of \u2013 as you look across the business performance in the quarter, really strong organic growth despite the storms. Can you just give us a flavor for the breadth of disparity in markets that you're seeing, what the low end of the growth curve look like and are there any significant outliers on the high end that are contributing to the strong shipment growth on an organic basis? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I'll take a shot at that. We talked a little bit about that in the geographic mix and price. And so we saw big shipments on large, particularly public work jobs in Arizona, Alabama and Illinois. We would take those jobs every day but they are at lower prices and therefore lower corresponding unit margins. At the same time, we got hit a little bit with weather in Virginia and in North Carolina, which are both higher price and higher margin. So all that mix was in there, but you're going to have mix at any time in this, I think. But if you look across our footprint, Jerry, we're seeing prices go up pretty much across our footprint. I think in the third quarter, I was very pleased with the breadth of operating improvements and kind of everybody's unit margin improving. And to make this thing happen, you want the whole group to go up at the same time and just move everything up a notch. And you've seen us do this before. And I think you saw the beginning of that in Q3 and we look \u2013 I think we're taking that right into Q4 and 2019. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And, Tom, you folks have been prudent in assuming SB1 as part of the business outlook in California until the money starts being spent. If SB1 stays in the mix after Election Day, what sort of magnitude of upside should we be thinking about to the preliminary volume guidance that you folks are laying out here? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Well, as you know, that's more than a doubling effect of funding in California for highway funding is what SB1 is. We're already seeing \u2013 that work is already being lapped. We won't see any those of jobs this year. But we'll see a fair amount of that flow through in 2019, both in Aggregates and in Asphalt. I'll remind you, we have the leading positions in both product lines. But I'll just address SB1 if you want me to. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Please. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: We're really encouraged by the support we see at SB1. There is an enormous effort to defeat Prop 6 in California. And if you watch the World Series, you even saw TV ads for defeating Prop 6 in California. People in California want their roads fixed and they're tired of it. Ironically, there's 15 local ballot initiatives in California on \u2013 right now in November for increasing infrastructure funding. So, supporting SB1 is just the right thing to do. Remember, we've already collected almost $5 billion in taxes that will flow through in 2019 and 2020. On top of that, there's another $1.5 billion per year in local funding. So, as you've heard us say before, California is growing. It's going to grow with or without SB1. SB1 is the right thing to do, and we're very encouraged by the support we've seen from Californians for SB1. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And Tom just to clarify, so if the repeal effort is defeated, that would be a significant tailwind. In other words, it's not already assumed in your guidance. Correct? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : And next we will hear from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Glad you provided outlook. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, and welcome Suzanne, looking forward to working with you. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. You as well. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Glad you provided \u2013 yeah. Appreciate the outlook on pricing and volumes for 2019. Can you kind of provide some color on the buildup of how you're thinking about public versus private, and could you see some upside in some of this pen-up demand given the weather drag you've seen this year? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. So, I think I would characterize that as solid, private very much growing public, and the public is really driven by highway funding, which we have a lot of visibility to. And we're just starting to touch the tip of the iceberg on flow through of all that funding, because remember it always takes two years for it to flow through. So, the demand we see is really public driven. But if you'll allow me to, I'd like to just kind of cover 2019 while we're on it. If we step back and look at it from a broad point-of-view, remember we're still \u2013 as I said earlier, we're still in the \u2013 we have long way to go to normalized demand much less peak, particularly with this much public funding coming on. We gave you mid-single digit price and volume. The business performance in Q3 gives us a lot of momentum going into Q4 and into 2019. Backlogs are at much higher levels and at higher prices, so is our booking pace. As we said earlier, the conversations on fixed plant increases for January of 2019 have gone very well. And I would summarize it to say that our \u2013 you're really seeing our profit engine start to accelerate. I would \u2013 kind of to Suzanne's point about strategy, I'd point to four key factors. One, our markets are going to grow faster than the rest of the country really because of our geographic advantage, but also our customer service and what we're \u2013 our visibility to backlogs and very large jobs that are booked are coming. Second point is, as Suzanne said, we expect to deliver expanding unit margins with good flow-throughs, drivers which will be, A, compounding price improvements; B, operating leverage with higher volumes; and C, our operating efficiencies that you saw in Q3. Third one, as you talked about, conversion of earnings into cash flows. And the fourth one was our disciplined approach to capital deployment. We're really focused on getting the full value out of our acquisitions and capturing the synergies that are available. We'll come back with guidance in February and a lot clearer view from your volume perspective, as we get kind of through the fourth quarter we got a better view of where these projects stand, particularly large highway projects and large non-res projects. And so, we'll just have a clearer picture at that point. But this is, our core structure's clear and it's really the same model you've seen from us deliver before. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I'll add just a little bit to that as well. I mean, coming in new, I try to look at it from what are we hearing on the macro front. We look at some of the same drivers that all of you on the call do, the ABI, the Dodge Momentum Index and various other measurement points. I would call your attention to one slide that is in the supplemental information we prepared. It comes from Dodge Analytics. I'm a big \u2013 I'm impressed with the information they provide having used it a lot in my past life. But on page eight in the slide deck, it shows the year-over-year change in trailing 12 months in terms of highway award dollars, and it separates that into what that picture of improvement looks like in the markets that we serve versus all the other markets. And as Tom mentioned, in the markets we serve, there is a significant increase in highway award dollars there. So where we are geographically does help us quite a bit from the macro perspective. And I think that we have many touch points on the ground, our plant managers, our sales people, other employees, our customers and so we want to make sure that we listen to what they're telling us. I think that as a complement to the macro data, you can't overlook what you're hearing on the ground and that provides you with a lot of intelligence as well. And so we're getting good indicators from those people as well. So, what we have heard on the ground isn't inconsistent in any way with macro. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : That's really helpful color. I mean, I think your stock is unfairly being kind of being beat up a bit on housing concerns. So Tom, if there is a view out there that hasn't moved sideways and just given the backlog and visibility you have on public, how do you think about growth the next years? I mean, how confident you are in terms of kind of sustaining that mid-single digit run rate the next few years in light of maybe some softening on the private side of things? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: So let's back up Q3, we saw that momentum. Q4, we're in October. We're seeing that growth momentum. I would describe the private side as solid. I would describe the public side is growing, and we're turning those rapidly-growing public funding and Aggregates shipments now, which we've been waiting for a while. But if you look at states like Georgia, Texas, South Carolina Tennessee, California, just to name a few, there's big, big public demand growth. So I think if we step back and let's put it in a little different perspective. If you look at nine of our states, which constitute over 80% of our revenues, the highway funding and local initiative funding in those states is up $20 billion per year. And most of those shipments haven't hit us yet. We haven't converted those tax revenues into shipments. And if you put that on a \u2013 compared to a federal bill, that would be an increase of almost 50% in a federal bill in just nine states. So that's a sea change in public funding and it's just now starting to flow through, so it'll flow through, it'll continue to increase in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022. But this is a big deal and it underpins our confidence in the markets and the demand in those markets. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : That's really helpful. And just one last one for me. Some of the mix headwinds you called out in 3Q, do you expect some of that dissipating in the fourth quarter, and how should we think about mix going into 2019? And, obviously, early in the year you called out some lag between pricing for ship and quoted pricing. Is that kind of largely behind you at this point? Thanks a lot. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'll take big jobs in any market I got any time. I think what we \u2013 what you're seeing though is with good weather in Virginia and North Carolina in October, we've shipped very well. So those are not a matter of I don't want to see a decrease in shipments in Alabama, Arizona or Illinois, but I think you're starting to see that volume, that pent-up demand ship in places like North Carolina and Virginia even Georgia. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So, I wanted to ask you a question around the 2019 guide and more conceptually around kind of how you're approaching things relating to obviously last year having some major storm impacts, this year having some major storm impacts. As you're looking at the guide for 2019, what are you taking into account as far as weather? Is it status quo, which will be kind of the new normal in terms of you're going to have some extreme weather year-to-year, or is there some different way that you're thinking about it looking into next year? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: How do you know the conversations we're having right now? Actually, we're just working through that, and that's a great question and one that, if you look at the mid-single digit volume, I would tell you we have solid confidence in that. How we vary from that will be timing of \u2013 as I said earlier, timing of large jobs. We've still got to step back and look at weather effect and how that works, which is extremely hard to do, but we'll get through it. And I think we'll give you a much clearer answer in February. I'm not trying to dodge your question, but that work is going on as we speak. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, the second question, I guess just more of a clarification around how some of the affected regions have progressed over the course of September and October. Are there any areas where you're still seeing facilities that are unable to ship into \u2013 or either unable to ship or unable to ship into major regions or \u2013 for the most part, I know you called out Texas as still being an issue, but have things returned to kind of pre-storm activity? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: That's a great question. The characteristics of the storms this year are quite different from last year. We don't see the lingering impacts that we saw and \u2013 both in shipments and in cost in general. Now, as you called out, wet weather in Texas has been an issue. I'd also tell you when the sun shines in Texas, we're shipping very strong. We've still got pumps (38:19) pumping lower levels, but we're operating all of our facilities. I don't think we have any facilities that aren't back up and running. So, I would call us in good shape on the East Coast. I'd say we're very healthy in Texas. When it quits raining every day, we ship. So, I don't see any lingering effects like we saw a year ago. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks, Tom. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. Operator : And next we will hear from Stanley Elliot with Stifel. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Stanley. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thank you guys for fitting me in and welcome, Suzanne. A quick question. When you think about \u2013 I guess, one, could you help us with how inventories are out in the field, how balanced are you guys heading into next year? And then maybe kind of take that and as we're looking at maybe higher public spend market or public spend environment next year, does that end up making it easier to balance inventories or is there not much of a difference? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Well, first of all, I think we were pretty disciplined in the downturn. And I think we've been very disciplined over the last four or five years in making sure where we had inventories that were long, i.e., fines or base, that we cut into those and I think we're in much better shape. Always you have sizes that times get short, particularly Asphalt, and I think we've done a good job maximizing our efficiencies in our plant, which affects cost but also inventory. So, as we stand right now, I think we're in great shape on inventories, not too much, not too little, and the right amount. I think that our planning process and our coordination has gotten better, and we've honed that in the return back to better shipments. So, I think we're going in a great shape. I think our plants and our facilities have a lot of flexibility to move up or down and be nimble with adjusting demand whether that's fundamental or timing of jobs or weather, and I think we've actually gotten better at that. And obviously, we've had good practice with weather over the last couple of years. So, I think we're in great shape. As far as the public demand is concerned, it tends to, and I'd underscore tends, new public construction tends to support a lot of base, also which is very good for operations, uses up our fines and I think we can adjust quickly off of that. It also uses a lot of the high-end pricing of asphalt aggregates, and also fits our Asphalt business. So, I think we're in really good shape and I think our folks on a local level have done a very good job being coordinated and ready for whatever comes at them. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I would agree with that and I would also add, if you look at some of the comparative inventory numbers, either comparing our Q3 number back to the beginning of the year or to third quarter last year, it will appear that it's a little bit higher. But that's as a result of the acquisitions that we've made over the year and really doesn't reflect any significant movement in the inventory levels at our same-store quarries. Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. That was my thought too. And then thinking about kind of the capital structure into next year, if 2 times to 2.5 times is the number, I mean, you should be right at the low-end, if not below, depending upon assumptions. What is the preference? Is M&A still of interest to you? Is it more organic growth? Is it buying shares back? Obviously, increasing the dividend is something you guys have talked about as well. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I'll let Suzanne take this, but I'll start with telling you that our capital priorities haven't changed. As you look at the M&A out there, we are as I said earlier, we're really focused on capturing the synergies of the acquisitions we've made and the greenfield work that we're working on, both of those tend to be some of our highest returns. But remember, our biggest engine of growth is going to be the volume growth and growing unit margins. You got a taste of that in Q3. It's exciting. We see it flowing rapidly into October and November. So \u2013 but I'll let Suzanne take capital priorities. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, just adding on to what Tom said, which I agree with, the capital allocation priorities do remain the same. You know what they are. We've got a bit of both in there. But they are predicated on the waterfall that shows us making sure that we spend an appropriate amount of operating CapEx to make sure that our existing business that we maintain and grow the value of the franchise. We do have an eye toward a progressive dividend. We've talked about the fact that we want to make absolutely sure that it can be sustained through the cycle regardless of the amount. Whatever we get to, we just need to be able to sustain it. But we would expect that to progressively grow in line with earnings. We look at growth CapEx. We've talked a bit about that. And then, we also have in the capital allocation priority returning excess cash to shareholders, primarily via share repurchase. And we have been in the market. Through the end of the third quarter, we spent about $100 million with respect to share repurchase. So, our job is to balance all those in an appropriate way and be disciplined about the use of capital and make sure that it goes into the areas that will be highest returning. With respect to M&A in particular, obviously, we're going to look at M&A opportunities as they arise. But we will be returns focused. We will be thoughtful about multiples. We certainly don't want to be in a position where we overpay, particularly when there are other competing uses of our capital. And I just want to reiterate the point, as Tom said, M&A is an important part of growth to the extent you get the right fit and the right returns. But always, always same-store growth, improving the business that you have is always going to be the most profitable business you have, and also the lowest risk because you own it and you have complete control over what you're doing. So, we'll continue to look, but our principal focus, I think, in the near term is going to be fully integrating those businesses we have acquired, betting them down to make sure we capture all the synergies that we planned and that we can capture. And then, as I said earlier, I think it may have been the first or second question, we want to focus on making sure in our same-store businesses that we are improving that unit profitability. Does that help? Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thank you very much. Absolutely. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Best of luck. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Garik. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : I guess my first question is just as you look out to 2019, can you just speak to some of the inflationary buckets in the Aggregates group that you are concerned about? Is it mainly diesel that's going to move around and drive less visibility and I guess as a knock-on to the inflationary question, are there any tariffs that you are exposed to that might impact either CapEx or raw materials? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: If you step back and look at the Aggregates business and with the Aggregates-focused business, we're just different and I'd call us special in this area. We have clear potential to do quite well in an environment of rising commodity cost. And that's really driven by three things; improving prices; compounding over time, which we've talked about; and remember, higher fuel and logistics only widens the moat and now you're starting to see us starting to capture the widening of that moat. You saw the tip of that in Q3. We own our major input, which is the rock in the ground. And the third point is there's plenty of room for improving unit margins with prices, better operating execution, and seeing fixed cost leverage. I'd take you back, as a reminder, over the past five years since the recovery began, our total cost of sales is up less than 1% per year with diesel being up 7% per year. So if you talk to our folks, they'd tell you that improving unit margins no matter what happens at the outside, it is our job, it's what we do. You saw progress of that in the third quarter. You've seen us do this before and you see us take great momentum on this into Q4 into 2019. So I have great confidence that we'll continue to grow unit margins regardless. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I would just add there, also referencing back to the slide deck when you get a chance. On slide 4, we have put in some longer-term trend data where we actually calculate our compound annual growth rate and we measure that as against trailing 12-month second quarter 2013, sort of really the start of the recovery. I like this slide because it shows that the improvements we made are not sort of one quarter, one-year type improvement. These are incremental compounding improvements that we need to stay focused on and continue to drive. On that slide, it specifically calls out the one measure, which I think is a great one and says a lot about how nimble and flexible Vulcan is when it comes to managing through sort of whatever comes at you over a five-year period, and that's unit cost of sales has increased less than 1% over that five-year period. And also on the slide, it's what I think is one of the most exciting numbers on the page and that is that through some compounding pricing improvement, over that five-year period, through managing our costs and efficiencies at the plant level, over that same period, our compound annual growth rate and gross profit per ton is 13%. That's a pretty \u2013 it's a pretty strong business model to take us forward. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Of course. Thanks for that color. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Just wanted to ask also on, if you think about pricing into 2019, I think as we were coming into this year, Tom, you were pretty bullish about pricing accelerating, particularly in the Southeast. I'm just wondering if there's any additional markets that you can call out when you look into next year that are kind of on a cusp for this breakout, whether it's from overly tight supply and breaking out. I know there's been fits and starts in mix this year that's impacted reported pricing. But I think you're too far ahead of yourself. As I look back, pricing really picked up in 2015 into 2016 as demand was very strong. Any regions that could maybe mimic that type of performance into 2019, 2020?. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Let me just kind of take you through the haves and have-nots on that. California, demand solid private, really big growth in highways. We've seen really good unit margin improvement in California. You've heard us talk about prices with step function in California over last year and this year, and I think that continues. They've also done a really good job of improving their cost and a lot of their operating efficiencies. So, I think the issue \u2013 and I'm really looking at from a growth and unit margin perspective, I'll give both price and how I see that. So very healthy in California; Texas, solid private growth, big growth in public demand with highways. Remember, Prop 7 again kicks in this year with an additional $3 billion. Prices in Texas, I would call out as energized. That started kind in the second half, but it's really going to hit in January 2019 with fixed plant price improvements, costs have been improving, solid margin growth, and you're going to have upside in Texas potentially in 2019 and 2020 in energy projects and we'd go back to that later. Gulf Coast, I would tell you a little slower and kind of \u2013 not a little bit of growth in volumes, some price increases. But I would tell you a little bit harder, but they're doing a good job with it just because the volume is big and public is not there. Southeast, very healthy good private, good public. Big funding South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia. Pricing is very good, continues to be very good. Improving operating discipline, so you'll see another jump in margins in 2019. East Coast, again very, very good. Growing private, growing public, much better pricing I think right now in bid work and going into 2019. And I think we've seen their operations breakout in the third quarter. So in the end, overall, I think our business model is on track. Solid \u2013 summary, solid private, growing public, prices moving up sharply in a lot of places, good operating disciplines, driving spend margins. I think we feel really good finishing this year and going into 2019. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just my last question is on Asphalt. Can you give us some perspective on how quickly can you actually raise pricing to offset inflation into next year or maybe another way to ask that, how many \u2013 what percentage of your markets have real-time escalators that could provide... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Let's step back. I'll let Suzanne kind of talk about what happened because I think it's important visibility to what happened in Asphalt in Q3 and then I'll touch some on the markets and what to expect. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. Sure. I mean, Tom is right. I mean, the liquid asphalt is where we saw a pretty significant acceleration of price in the third quarter. We've had some price increases leading in before that and had raised our prices to take that increase into account and combat. So our prices actually went up about 8% in terms of what we were able to pass along to customers in the third quarter. But liquid asphalt cost in the third quarter went up 29% and that had an impact \u2013 that 29% had an impact of about $60 million in the third quarter. So that's a pretty tough number to overcome, particularly when it happens quickly like that. But just as you saw us be able to raise prices 8% going in, we will continue to raise prices to offset this 29% increase that we saw. I mean there's always just a bit of a time lag on the front end as you try to catch that upward curve. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think that's well explained. So, our prices went up $4. And sequentially quarter-over-quarter Asphalt went up for about $40, which is $2 of cost. Our unit margins were down $2.50. So you can see we were going to catch it except for we got caught again with an increase in liquid. This is the one place in our business where commodity/energy can hit us hard and fast. It \u2013 remember, it's only 10% of our business, but it is also only temporary. Unit margins will catch up. They always do. I think our Asphalt business has a very bright future, particularly with all the highway funding, which is a big driver of asphalt demand. And it's really exciting if you look at where that money is and where we're in the Asphalt business or leader in the Asphalt business in Texas, Tennessee and California. So this will fix itself. It always does. And by the way when it turns down, we'll put a bunch of that in our pocket. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC : Understood. Thanks again. Best of luck. Operator : And our next question will come from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning, Kathryn. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : First color is \u2013 first question is really just circling back on the rails, any color on rail line transportation bottlenecks easing? And also, I know that there were several rail lines that were washed out post-Hurricane Florence and wanted to get any color you have on recovery efforts there. Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. The railroads continue to try to improve. We're still having issues. I think we're \u2013 they're slowly getting there, but it's cost us some volume and it's cost us some opportunities in 2018, and in fact, we're working on railroad stuff next week to try to make sure that we got it behind us as we enter 2019. As far as the storm is concerned, we did have a washout, which cut us off for a few weeks from one of our yards. Bad news is, we couldn't get the yard. The good news was, we shipped rock to fill in the washout. So kind of a little bit of good and bad with that. But as far as our facilities are concerned and it's a great question. I think that we're in good shape including railroad ability to service our yards along the coast. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Thanks. I wanted to focus a little bit on residential. We've noted in this \u2013 as you know we try to have a boots-on-the-ground view of the market and I found that in both Texas and in Tennessee in particular, we've seen some larger greenfield residential projects that were either put to the side in last cycle and are starting up or are being developed to address fast-growing markets. What are you seeing in terms of this type of trend, particularly in the light of rising interest rates, and would love to just get your view on that trend in general. Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think we've seen a little bit of that. I'll also tell you, we've seen \u2013 we're seeing some very large ones kick-off, particularly in Southern California. In fact, one of the largest ever done is right outside of our quarry in San Diego, which we're really excited about. It'll start to really crank up next year. If you look at res in our markets just fundamentally, ours are stronger than most around the country and the fundamentals are just there. You got population growth. You got continuing employment growth. You still got low inventories of houses, I think. So we see continued steady growth in res, maybe not as robust as it's been in the past, but steady. Maybe probably a little stronger in single than multi, which is okay for us because it's more Aggregates-intensive. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I'd I just add to that the states that we called out there that have seen some of that improvement, Texas and California, keep in mind, those are two of our largest states in terms of Aggregates. So whatever is going on there, we will definitely get our fair share of it. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Yeah. No, we're definitely aware of that. Then just in terms of \u2013 you've touched on SB1 in California and starting to see strong lettings out of that state, we've been tracking on our end. Could you talk about other states where you're seeing those dollars translating to volumes that perhaps passed legislation, for instance, like in Georgia and Texas, but you're seeing in terms of the pace that will \u2013 volumes will improve from the dollars? Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. I'll touch on probably the newest ones. I think Georgia is actually starting to flow-through. We're seeing shipments on those big projects that we've talked about. Texas is the most mature, we've got Prop 7, as you know, with additional $3 billion in 2019, they've really got their act together, and I think they'll get that worked out pretty fast. On the IMPROVE Act in Tennessee, which is a 40% increase in funding in Tennessee. Tennessee DOT, I would describe it has done an excellent job and one of the fastest to get worked out. We're already starting to ship on both Asphalt and Aggregates on projects. We've got a lot of work \u2013 a number of jobs booked for 2019. As I said, we'll actually see a little bit in 2018, which is quite quick. South Carolina is a little slower. We've not seen anything in 2018, probably see it being in 2019. But remember, South Carolina had the big bonds from a few years ago, so we've seen a big slug of big interstate work, which we'll ship on \u2013 we're shipping on now and will flow into 2019, which will kind of bridge us over to Act 40 (60:46). Is that giving you some clarity? Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Yeah. No, it definitely does because it helps to set expectations for California because the way we've seen it, it typically takes at least 24-plus months for the dollars to hit to the volumes to actually get flowing. So, that was helpful. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Right. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Thank you. And then finally, one of the things that we've seen with these big infrastructure projects that's maybe a little bit different than the past is they're really \u2013 they're very large projects... J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Right. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : ...they're multiple years. But they may not be new projects. They're more like I'm adding three additional lanes to a current project. For the markets in which you serve, are you seeing a similar type trend or are you seeing perhaps more of a mix of just entirely new roads in addition to significant expansions? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I would call it a mix. I would also point out that the inside to this is that these large projects, the different DOTs are at different stages of being able to handle them and handle them in a timely manner. Texas, like as I said earlier, has done the best job of giving big projects and having them ready and have them flow through smoothly. We are just seeing in a lot of states the big design build jobs take substantially longer than maybe what is budgeted or is planned by the DOT or the contractors. And we've been talking about this. I think that we have a better handle on that as we plan for 2019 and 2020 than maybe we did as we planned for 2017 and 2018 just because we know the right questions to ask. But you're right. It is a mix and it is taking longer to get done. Now, once they get going, they're quite efficient. Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Okay. Perfect. And based on the quarry run you held at Nashville, your inventories look just fine in Middle Tennessee. Thank you very much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Did you win? Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC : Not so much. Not so much. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thanks for participating. Operator : And next we will hear from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Notwithstanding the weather issues, pretty good volume growth here. I presume that's helping you work through some of that backlogged work. Is there a way for us to think about what's left in that backlog, Tom, that's priced well below the ASP at least we can see today? Is that likely to bleed into the construction season next year, or is there an opportunity with some decent fall, winter conditions to work through a lot of that? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I think is what we've been saying is week-over-week, month-over-month, the work we're putting in is at higher prices. So \u2013 and we have put in a lot more work. So I would say that the bid work will continue to step up much similar that what you saw between Q3 and Q4. As Suzanne called out, it was 50 basis points. And so, as every day you're working off old work, replacing it with new higher price work, I think the market gets it. And so there will be two \u2013 there will be kind of two stages to the price increase, month-over-month, week-over-week, the bid work will continue to march up, and that will just continue through 2019. And then your fixed plant work, you'll see a bigger jump in January as fixed plant price increases go into effect for the year. Does that make sense? Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.: It does. Thank you. And then, on the outlook for this year, has the expectation for U.S. Aggregates changed at all? Has that been impacted by weather as well? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: The short answer to your question, yeah, U.S. Aggregates has been impacted. As I step back and look at it, these assets are a really good strategic fit for us. We'll probably be a little short, about $50 million, maybe in the $45 million range. Three issues there. And the short-term issue is weather, as you called out, really related to Michael. As we talked about earlier, the rail service interruption have been real for us there. They have cost us volume. They have cost us opportunities in customer service. And then there's \u2013 the third item there would be there's a very large \u2013 there's some very large project work in Florida. There's backlog. It's to the tune of about 2 million tons. We expected it to ship in 2018. We'll start shipping in 2019. Probably a blessing in disguise with the rail issues we have that it did get pushed back. But one of the things we're really pleased with, with Agg USA, is the plant improvements and the efficiency improvements and cost improvements that we implemented this year. It gets us set up for 2019. I think if you look at 2019's plan, we'll capture the synergies in volume, cost, prices and unit margins. And so far, we can't control temporary issues out of your control obviously, but we're pleased with execution, plan and strategic fit. Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Okay, perfect. And then one more, I guess breaking out the crystal ball here, but do you guys have a view on liquid asphalt costs as it relates to IMO 2020, possible tightening in the market? Any preliminary thoughts there? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: We've read a lot about it. There's all kinds of theories that it will cause diesel to go up and liquid to go \u2013 AC to go down. I think what's important about that is, as we talk about all the time, we'll handle what \u2013 we can't control that, we'll handle what gets thrown at us. We'll adjust accordingly with price and with escalators, and we'll watch it very closely, but too early to tell. And I don't know that we need a view as much as we need to be ready for whatever happens. Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Understood. Okay. I appreciate the color. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Scott Schrier with Citi. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for getting me in there. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I want to go back. Last quarter, you had mentioned that you were kind of expecting that trend you have in same-store shipments to continue. I think you were at 11%. And I'm curious \u2013 and I understand you had weather in September \u2013 I'm looking at slide 5, that July and August was 7%. So, is there anything to read in there in the quarter? Was there residential slowness, was there any kind of project delays or anything in there or do you feel that July and August on a same-store basis met your expectations? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yeah. I think July and August were meeting our expectations. There's no slowdown. That is really shipping at a pretty good pace. And last quarter, same-store, if I remember, it was \u2013 or the same-store this year, this quarter, it was 10% and 6% (01:07:46). There was a lot off from what we had last quarter. I think if you look at the underlying demand and all the leading indicators and what's happening on the ground, we feel really good about volume. We continue to ship strong in October. We called out Texas, but every place \u2013 even in Texas, we were shipping when we have a ray of sunshine, and the rest of the country has been strong. So, I think we feel really good about underlying demand, project work starting to flow, public funding starting to flow in, kind of steady on the private side. And I think October only gives us more confidence in that. The mid-single-digit for next year, it's just too early to tell. We've got work to do. We have confidence in that, but we've got a lot of work to do on that as we've talked about in the call. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then... Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: And I think again, we \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 I think, again, that mid-single-digits for next year \u2013 and my favorite word is thoughtful \u2013 we've tried to be thoughtful about putting that together. And as we get more information leading into when we next speak to you guys with Q4 and as we go through next year, you get more and more visibility. There's more activity being booked. And so we would, as we always would, adjust that as needed as we go forward next year. If things pick up and are strong then we will come back in and share with you our latest view on that. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit about Concrete. It seemed like you had a pretty strong result there, especially considering \u2013 I know Virginia had the weather but you had pricing, you had the material spread. So I'm curious if you could talk about your expectations in Concrete. Do you see the fundamentals there to continue to expand your material margins? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Yes, we \u2013 the short answer is, yes, we do. Our Concrete businesses are in, what I'll call, privileged markets, both the growth profile and the structure of the markets. But we \u2013 even with volume down, we did better, and that was really weather in Virginia. But, again, there are \u2013 prices continue to move up and offset any raw materials costs or fuel costs. And we would expect that flowing into 2019. Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : And we will now move to Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Michael Wood - Instinet LLC : Hi. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Good morning. Michael Wood - Instinet LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the residential side of your private spending. The slowdown according to the homebuilders and building product companies seemed to have accelerated really near the third quarter. And I appreciate your comments it's in the large projects that are about to get started. But if the slowdown does worsen, when would you expect to see the impact on your business as like when would your backlog that you have now currently get worked through? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: As we look into 2019, we don't see the slowdown in the projects that we see out there in our markets. So, they'd be further out if it \u2013 much further out if it happens. And again, the fundamentals are there, our backlogs and talking to our customers, we actually feel kind of good about slow and steady. But we're not seeing a slowdown in our market. So, it's hard for me to predict it, but it'd be pretty far out because we have some visibility to it. Michael Wood - Instinet LLC : Is your California mix between private and public relatively similar to your national mix? J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: I would \u2013 yeah, it's probably not too far out in any of our markets, particularly with our Asphalt business in California. You got to remember that with public coming on, it really helps the Asphalt business and the flow-through of Aggregates into that business and the base that goes underneath it. So, we are looking forward to more highway projects in California. Michael Wood - Instinet LLC : Great. And just finally I wanted to ask about the cost control, besides just managing your operations around the weather, is there anything else that you have to highlight in terms of what's helping you reduce costs at your quarries? If you can give us some details, I'd appreciate that. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Sure. It's just core disciplines, and we've taken a look at our largest facilities, a number of them had teams look at them for opportunity searches. I think our folks are always doing this. If I took you to any of our plants, they're going to have a conversation about how to improve throughput of the plant, how to improve downtime in the plant, how to get more out of their fuel costs, out of their explosives costs. There's nothing here that is anything except for really, really good hard core operating disciplines and attention to detail and sharing knowledge across our footprint. And if you talk to any of our folks, they'd just tell you that's their job, that's what they do. Michael Wood - Instinet LLC : Great. Thank you. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks. J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. As you can tell, Suzanne and I are excited about our business. It's really fun to watch our profit engines crank up. We're excited with the performance in Q3, really excited as we look into Q4 and 2019. We appreciate the time you spent with us this morning. We appreciate your support of Vulcan. We look forward to seeing you and speaking with you throughout the quarter, and we hope you have a great week. Thank you. Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.: Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in our company. In addition to discussing the fourth quarter and full year results, we will also touch on several other matters of interests, including our improving pricing dynamic, our view on 2019 demand and shipments, and our financial expectations for 2019. Suzanne will review the financial shortly. But first, let me get right to the notable things about the fourth quarter that set us up for a strong 2019. The quarter was a great finish to the year. We delivered a 24% increase in gross profit in our core Aggregates segment. We enjoyed solid shipment growth, compounding price improvements and discipline cost control. A principal driver of the strength in the quarter was an 8% increase in total Aggregates shipments, 4% on a same-store basis. These higher shipments were largely due to the growing demand in the public sector. The many increases in state and local highway funding that we have seen across our footprint are now turning into shipments. We are in the very early stages of big growth in highway demand. Shipments in the quarter rebounded in Texas and Virginia, states that are among our more profitable markets, and solid growth continued in Florida Arizona Alabama and Illinois. Our pricing dynamic also improved in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of mix, our freight-adjusted pricing increased approximately 5% compared to last year\u2019s quarter, including mix, pricing increased 2% due to stronger shipments in relatively lower priced markets such as Alabama, Arizona and Illinois. We have seen improving pricing momentum quarter-after-quarter. This ongoing momentum sets the stage as we move into 2019. It\u2019s supported by improved backlogs of private and public work, customer confidence, demand visibility and logistics constraints. Throughout the quarter and the year we were highly focused on operating efficiencies and cost control. For the quarter, we converted all of our higher revenue into gross profit, finishing the full year with a 12-month same-store flow through rate of 64% in our Aggregates segment. Overall, for the full year we, increased total revenues, earnings from continuing operations before taxes, and adjusted EBITDA, while decreasing our overhead expenses as a percent of total revenues. For the full year, we achieved record Aggregates cash gross profit per ton of $6.32. Our safety performance, which is a leading indicator of operational excellence and proper stewardship of our most important resource, which is our people. I am immensely proud that we further advanced our safety performance improving on our record setting results from the previous year. For 2018, our injury rate was 0.92 per 200,000 employee hours worked, which is world-class. This is a great tribute to the performance of our people throughout our company. Our performance in our core Aggregates business improved throughout 2018. The momentum we generated and these positive trends in our Aggregates business will play forward into 2019. We continue to see growth in private demand in Vulcan-served markets. In the public sector, demand growth is coming on strong and it\u2019s most notable in the markets that we serve. Nine Vulcan states that generate almost 80% of our revenue have passed infrastructure legislation over the last three years. These laws have raise funding by almost 60% over 2015 levels. Altogether, state laws and local initiatives to increase transportation infrastructure revenue have added more than $20 billion annually of funding in just these nine Vulcan states. That\u2019s nearly half as much as the federal government provides each year for all 50 states. So the pace of the conversion of public funding and lettings into shipments continues to accelerate and while the timing of those shipments is never precise, the direction is clearly up. This creates a healthy and positive pricing environment. Our backlogs and booking pace are in great shape and are improving. This along with our 2019 fixed plant price increases gives us confidence in the growing strength of 2019. Now I will turn the call over to Suzanne for a more detailed view of the numbers. Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. I will cover some key points from the full year and then move on to our 2019 guidance. For the year just ended, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.132 billion. This represented a 15% improvement over 2017 and was achieved despite significantly higher diesel fuel and liquid asphalt costs. Diesel costs increased $26 million or 25% in 2018 and liquid asphalt costs were up $54 million or 32%. Gross profit in our Aggregates segment increased 16% in the year, our unit profitability increased 6% and our margins expanded due to solid growth in shipments, compounding pricing improvements and operating efficiencies. For the full year, shipments grew by 10% or, on a same-store basis 6%, mix adjusted pricing increased by 3.5% improving as the year progressed, and importantly, our same-store unit cost of sales decreased by 2%, more than offsetting the higher diesel costs, I mentioned earlier. Together with our improved Aggregates pricing, this disciplined approach to cost resulted in the 64% same-store flow through for the full year that Tom mentioned earlier. These results demonstrate the strength of our Aggregates-focused business even when we experience headwinds. As stated last quarter, we remain focused on the things we can control such as our cost base and the efficiencies and operating leverage that drive our Aggregates\u2019 profitability. We focus on these rather than things not in our control such as cost pressures, inclement weather or the precise timing of large project starts. Our focus on accountability is a large part of our success and we will continue these disciplines. Now with respect to the non-aggregates part of our business, it was a bit of a mixed bag. For the Concrete segment, gross profit increased by 10% year-over-year. On the other hand, the Asphalt segment had a challenging year with liquid asphalt costs negatively affecting gross profit. While we were able to increase our own prices to customers by approximately 6% in the full year, much of the rise in liquid asphalt costs occurred in the second half and so we were unable to fully offset the higher annual costs, and as a result, the Asphalt segment\u2019s full year gross profit declined by $35 million or 38%. We will continue our efforts to price so as to offset these costs, but the impact will be gradual as we cycle through existing contracts. In the accompanying slide, you will find information on our cash flows for the full year, but I will quickly recap the more noteworthy items. In the year, we spent $222 million on operating and maintenance capital in line with our prior estimate. Our growth CapEx investment was $247 million, a bit lower than our guidance during the third quarter call. While some of this difference is timing related, we do remain disciplined with our capital spending and continue our careful review of the nature and scope of projects. In 2018, we also invested $221 million in bolt-on acquisitions, which complemented our existing positions and expanded our capabilities in Alabama California and Texas. And finally, we returned $282 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases compared to $193 million in 2017. So moving on to 2019, when we last spoke with you, we shared a preliminary outlook that called for mid single-digit growth in shipments and pricing for Aggregates, with the caveat that our detailed budget development and reviews were under way. Having concluded those processes our current expectations are in line with those earlier assumptions. We expect continued demand growth in our markets, particularly on the public side and this view is supported by what we are seeing in our backlogs and new bookings. Specifically, for 2019, we expect Aggregates shipments growth of 3% to 5% and freight-adjusted price increases of 5% to 7%. Additionally, we maintain our longer term view of an approximate 60% same-store flow through rate to gross profit on a trailing 12-month basis, understanding that like this year the rate can vary quarter-to-quarter. Turning to our non-aggregates segments which include Asphalt and Concrete, we expect 15% to 20% growth in gross profit collectively with the assumption of relatively stable liquid asphalt costs. SAG expenses in the year are forecast to be $355 million, reflecting higher revenues. Notably, our SAG expenses as a percentage of revenues continue to decline and we remain focused on efficiently leveraging our overhead costs. We anticipate that interest expense will be approximately $130 million and that the category of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization together will approximate $360 million. The combination of these assumptions results in a 2019 adjusted EBITDA range of $1.25 billion to $1.33 billion, with the low end of that range representing a double-digit increase as compared to 2018. Now, as you know, our business is an inherently cash generative one and 2019 will be no exception. As you model our cash flows for the year I will share some thoughts with you that will help you fill in the blanks. The most important point is that we will continue to follow our capital allocation priorities and will stay within our debt leverage target range. We project the non-discretionary uses of cash to be as follows in the year. Cash interest expense of $125 million, operating and maintenance CapEx of $250 million, and finally, cash taxes of $160 million. The discretionary uses of our cash involve returns to shareholders, internal growth capital and acquisitions. So let me touch on each of these. First, we expect to maintain a progressive dividend, generally growing it in line with earnings to a level that is fully sustainable through the cycle. Second, we expect to spend approximately $200 million on growth CapEx for projects that are largely underway. These include the opening of strategic quarries in California, Texas and South Carolina, as well as improvements to our logistics and distribution network and sales yards. Third, we will continue our disciplined evaluation of acquisition opportunities as they arise and we will only invest in those which fit our strategy and which offers superior returns and synergies. And last but not least, we will continuously evaluate the use of opportunistic share repurchases as a means to return excess cash to shareholders. As I conclude my comments on our 2019 guidance, let me quickly address our balance sheet strength and capital allocation priorities. We are committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, strong balance sheet structure and debt-to-EBITDA leverage between 2 times and 2.5 times. Currently, our weighted-average debt maturity is 15 years and our long-term weighted average interest rate is 4.6%. This debt profile, together with our strong cash flow, gives us the flexibility to sensibly and responsibly manage our business. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and we will be disciplined in the use of that capital, always seeking to improve our returns and shareholder value. And now, I will turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thanks, Suzanne. I am proud of our people\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Despite serious external disruptions in 2018 and large increases in the cost of liquid asphalt and diesel fuel, we still delivered strong top and bottomline growth, while also growing the business in strategic locations. Our strategy is clear and compelling. Our operational structure is lean and locally led and our positions in attractive long-term growth markets are simply unrivaled. Our teams perform to high standards, focused on continuous improvement. We are well-equipped to take advantage of market opportunities or market challenges. We have big goals for 2019. These goals are focused on improving our performance in our operating disciplines, how we service our customers and how we grow our people. We are leveraging our strengths and growth opportunities further building on the deep engagement we have in the day-to-day improvement of our business. We also continue our strategic focus on logistics all across our footprint, encompassing rail, trucking, Blue Water and our barge system, with a focus on improving internal efficiencies, while continuing to enhance the customer experience. We are excited about 2019 and the following years for a number of reasons. Most notably, the sea change we are witnessing in the public sector investment in transportation infrastructure and the very positive impacts of our focus on growing unit margins. Moving forward, we are especially well suited to benefit as infrastructure demand in key Vulcan states continues to grow, fueled by these substantial increases in state and local funding. Now we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Tom Hill : Good morning Trey. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Trey Grooms : Hey. Good morning, everyone. First off, I guess, I want to just ask on the pricing, 5% to 7% increase this year. Can you talk about, is there any mix expectations one way or the other there and any color you can give us maybe on how to think about cadence and any other driver factors behind that guide? Tom Hill : Sure. As Suzanne and I both said, the pricing momentum in our business is clearly improving. We saw another big step up in the fourth quarter. If you look at \u201819, our confidence is really built on three things and three things that we have a lot of visibility to. The first one would be our current booking prices continue to move up. Number two, our bid and backlog prices are up. That\u2019s something we see very clearly and it constitutes about 60% of our business. And then, third, Trey, we are experiencing solid price improvements in our January and our April prices increases to our fixed plant concrete and asphalt customers. We are seeing price increases across every one of our markets in \u201819. Supporting that confidence is our customer\u2019s, the visibility they have in demand growth and it\u2019s really underpinned by the improving pipeline of big public work and solid backlogs of private work. I am pleased with the disciplines in our sales force and how they blew pricing up over the last two or three quarters. There may be a little bit of positive geographic mix built into \u201819 but the reality is, if you look at our backlogs our bid work and fixed plant prices, they are all just definitely up as -- from where we were a year ago. Trey Grooms : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then -- appreciate that. As a follow up, if you can give us a little more color on kind of how you build into that 3% to 5% volume. You mentioned solid growth of course in private demand and then I think you used the word strong growth in public demand. But any more color you could give us around your assumptions there, anything to note around weather or end market or you mentioned geographic mix, but just anything else that you could give us on how you build into that a little bit more granular? Tom Hill : Yeah. So I think it\u2019s probably easier done if I just kind of take you around the country and talk about just maybe some different markets and it\u2019s a little bit of a long answer. But California -- starting with California in the west, we see solid volume and price growth in 2019. The public side is showing real strength with SB-1 measures starting to flow through and those projects starting to ship. Private side continues to grow both in res and non-res. We may see a little bit of weakness in housing in the Bay Area, but other than that, the private side is good and we had strong pricing California in \u201818, we will continue to see that in \u201819. Moving to Arizona, good growth strong growth in public and private res and non-res continue to be strong. We have got some big highway work that we started shipping in \u201818, it will flow all the way through \u201819, good pricing momentum. Texas, very strong highway work in Texas as Prop 1 and Prop 7 money start kicking-in in \u201819. This will benefit Vulcan both in Aggregates and Asphalt. Housing remains strong, non-res, not quite as strong, but growing. Overall good demand, very good pricing momentum. Now, Coastal Texas is particularly strong, we had seen the downturn, we are back there both on the private and the public side. Moving to the middle of the country, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois probably challenged demand, not as robust as the West Coast or the East Coast. But where we are encouraged about there is our execution on price cost particularly on unit margin and I am pleased with the team\u2019s performance and maybe even though they are facing some headwinds. Tennessee, highway work will be very good as the Improve Act starts kicking in in \u201819. We will see both Aggregates and Asphalt on those projects, very good pricing environment, we either backlog or bidding some 25 Improve Act projects now. Moving to the Southeast and that would include Georgia, South Carolina and Florida in this, very solid growth in all segments, a really strength for us and also very good pricing. North -- from there North Carolina, strong growth, again, in all segments and healthy price improvements. The highways are starting to kick up and funding is starting to pick up in North Carolina. And then Virginia, solid growth in all segments also, with prices moving up. This will be a strong year with prices, as I said earlier, moving up across every one of our markets. Trey Grooms : All right. Thank you very much. That\u2019s all very helpful. I will pass it on. Congrats on a good quarter. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Tom Hill : Good morning. Mike Dahl : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to actually follow up with my first question on the geographic commentary and drill down specifically into California and I was hoping that you would be able to give, if possible, a little more in the way of order of magnitude for growth on the public versus private and I am thinking within private specifically on those comments about residential. If we look at what the builders are reporting from an order standpoint, certainly some significant declines. Just curious kind of how much of that is just going to impact you guys with a lag or if there\u2019s something else driving the offsetting strength in residential? Tom Hill : I will start with the public side. We think Caltrans is doing a good job accelerating to SB-1 funding and the lettings. We have already backlogged over 30 projects. We are -- we know of another 15 to 20 projects that will bid in the next few months. So they are really doing a good job of getting worked out, getting it let and we are starting to see -- starting to ship that. Remember, in California, it does -- we are the largest Aggregate producer but we are also the largest Asphalt producer and these early jobs have a lot of hot mix in them. So we are very encouraged by Caltrans and how quickly they have taken that funding put in the lettings and we will see that work shift throughout 2019. On the res side, I would tell you in the vast majority of markets in California, we continue to see growth in residential. As I called out, the Bay Area maybe -- would probably be the exception to that and that we will see some weakness there, when it\u2019s still -- the fundamentals are there and inventories are still quite low in California. Non-res, we see strength in our backlogs and our booking phase in non-res. So we think we will see growth in California in non-res in \u201819. Mike Dahl : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Tom Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Mike Dahl : My second question is with respect to the guidance around Asphalt and so just hoping to understand that a bit better, I think the combined three categories you are guiding for in dollar terms an increase of something like $16 million to $22 million in gross profit. So I think there\u2019s a comment that most of that\u2019s driven by the Asphalt part, but can you just give us a little more detail around how much improvement to expect in Asphalt and I know you mentioned timing, but just given where Asphalt costs are currently, should we expect that that whole $54 million is recouped at some point over the next, call it, four quarters to six quarters? Tom Hill : Well, I think, the improvement -- the 15%. 20% that Suzanne talked about in other products, the -- you are right, the majority of that is in Asphalt. Looking back a little bit \u201818 was just a really tough year for us in the Asphalt product line. We had -- wet weather didn\u2019t help us but really we got caught with the cost of rapidly rising liquid cost which cost us over $50 million. But with the new public funding coming through strong in Vulcan markets, we are expecting to see double-digit growth in volumes in \u201819. It\u2019s supported by backlogs and what we see bidding in highway lettings in \u201819 which is very strong. We believe that the liquid prices should stabilize, are stabilizing and we think we will see some modest improvement in unit margins as we work through \u201819. Remember we have been -- we raised prices dramatically all the way through \u201818 so we are starting to catch that. We are always behind the liquid price. We are starting to catch it now, and we should see much improved performance in the Asphalt product line in \u201819 over \u201818 driven by demand and price improvements and stabilization of pricing or cost in liquid AC. Suzanne Wood : And I would just add to that in terms of the pricing, I -- in my remarks I had called out the fact that we had increased prices by about 6% in that Asphalt sector for the full year. But in the fourth quarter, we increased by about 7%, so you can see that that is on an accelerating trend as we are trying to catch up with those costs, the majority of which happened with big spikes in the second half of the year. Mike Dahl : Got it. Okay. Thank you both very much and nice results. Tom Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Suzanne Wood : Hi. Good morning. Nishu Sood : Thank you. I wanted to ask about the cost performance in Aggregates, you obviously had good fixed cost leverage and cost outs enough to offset rising prices, for example, diesel and other costs. As we look ahead into \u201819, should we look at the efforts in \u201818 as being more one-off efforts that might not be repeated or can you keep up the kind of pace of the cost outs in \u201819? Tom Hill : Yeah. Look, Suzanne and I are very proud of our operating teams and their performance improving their operating disciplines in the fourth quarter and actually throughout 2018. As I mentioned in my remarks, they finished the year with a world-class safety performance, which is -- just speaks to the discipline in operating side of the business. And they actually lowered their cost in the fourth quarter and the full year in the face of dramatically rising fuel costs and probably some pretty wet conditions. I\u2019d just say that\u2019s just a job well done and great momentum that we carry into \u201819. As you guys know this operating discipline is a key part of our continuous quest to improve our unit margins. It\u2019s just part of that formula and the good news I would tell you is, I don\u2019t think our operators are done. I think they still have potential out there and I kind of know this that they are working hard to implement their 2019 execution plans, while they build on that \u201818 performance. So I just tell you, I am really pleased with our operators and encouraging them that we are not done that we will keep the momentum and improve on it in \u201819. Suzanne Wood : And I will just add to that too. I mean when you think about our business, you can really drive it down to something pretty simple that sets us apart from others, perhaps, and that is our unit profitability. Our main goal is to drive that unit profitability, that\u2019s something that isn\u2019t one year initiative, as Tom said. It\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s ongoing because you can\u2019t stand still with that. You have got to continue to move it forward and we have got three ways to do it, you focus on pricing, you focus on volume and then you focus on operating efficiencies, and the discipline and the accountability in each of the plans. And like Tom, I am very proud of what we have accomplished here for the year and in particular for the last few months. I especially like focusing on the operational efficiencies and driving costs at the plant level because I call that self-help. It\u2019s something that\u2019s within our control. It\u2019s not something that you are waiting for that could be impacted by a number of things, not least of which is weather. So, yes, that\u2019s an ongoing effort and it\u2019s something, I can tell you, we think about and talk about here every single week. Nishu Sood : Got it. No. Appreciate the color there. Second question I just wanted to ask about the volume-price relationship. I mean, obviously, there\u2019s a pretty well established relationship there and we are seeing it in effect, but as volumes are accelerating pricing is as well. My question is we have had a much choppier environment for Aggregates volumes growth over the last couple of years versus let\u2019s say earlier in the recovery. Does that affect the relationship between volume and pricing in any way, I mean, we have heard arguments from investors both ways, it might depress the relationship or it might enhance it. What are your thoughts on that, if there is any change from the choppiness? Tom Hill : I think it\u2019s really the visibility to the future is what impacts price and so that people know that there is volume coming and jobs coming they can take risk on the jobs they are bidding at that point. And that\u2019s really important because as we move through the recovery, the public side moving up rapidly is much clear, those jobs are very public. The DOTs, everybody knows within six to 12 months of what\u2019s going to let and how it\u2019s letting and those lettings are increasing dramatically in our markets. That does a whole lot to give our customers and entire segment visibility to what\u2019s coming to be able to risk price. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. And I would just add to that with respect to the highway shipments, I mean, the timing might not always be precise and crystal clear on those, but the direction of travel certainly is. It\u2019s something that we and our customers and others in the space can get their minds around. And I think that the sales folks here really did a good job in the early fall kind of setting the tone for price increases upcoming volumes by sending out price increase letters and talking to our customers really, really early on that. Because that, if you have that conversation with your customers and everyone understands what the expectations are prior to our customers speaking to their customers and going down the chain, it just gives them the time to do what they need to do and it just creates a much better pricing environment and I think with the sequential and year-over-year pricing improvement that we saw Q3 and Q4, I think it really that was a good starting point for it. Nishu Sood : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Hi. Good morning. Tom Hill : Good morning Jerry. Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Hi. Good morning. Jerry Revich : Really nice to see pricing cadence, it\u2019s not normal seasonality for pricing to really accelerate into the fourth quarter. So I am wondering, if you folks can expand on just the comments you made on the drivers of price acceleration into the fourth quarter of \u201818 and as I think about what \u201819 could look like as a result relative to the guide, the starting point is plus 5 and we have price increases coming over the course of \u201819. Seems like it\u2019s pretty easy to get toward the higher end of your guidance range for pricing if that\u2019s the cadence, I am wondering if you care to comment on that please. Tom Hill : Yeah. I think that, first of all, I -- we are very pleased with the momentum and the pick-up. That\u2019s what we thought was going to happen in the second year and it just goes to our visibility as I spoke to earlier of the bid work and the backlog pricing and it\u2019s underscored with the fixed plant pricing that we saw in January and we will see in April. We have done this before. We have seen it before. We have stepped up and it just over time in sequence. So I think we feel very good about it. Whereas this past year in \u201818, was very much back-half loaded. I think we will continue to grow prices as we go through \u201819. I don\u2019t think it will be as choppy as \u201818. I think it will be much smoother. But as we work off old work and we put new work on it will move up. Now remember, the comps will get tougher as you go throughout the year also. But -- so I would always, I think, we will see the prices ease up as we go through the year. I just don\u2019t think it will be quite as choppy if \u201818, if I am answering your question. Jerry Revich : Yeah. That\u2019s helpful, Tom. Thank you. And just to take a step back in the early phases of this recovery, you folks have certainly been leading the markets from a pricing standpoint and you have highlighted at your Analyst Day that that had come at the expense of some share. Are we at a point where your share you view as normalized and we are now back to the point where we could lead the market in pricing beyond \u201819, I guess it feels like you have got pretty good momentum heading into \u201820 and I just want to make sure I understand your view of the competitive landscape, as well as we exit \u201819 at a pretty healthy pricing clip. Tom Hill : I think whether it\u2019s the competitive landscape or our customers, I think, what\u2019s really going to support pricing and I am kind of repeating myself is the visibility and the clarity to the growing public work and while we will see big growth in public demand in \u201819 and solid in private, \u201820 will be more public work and \u201821 will be the more public work. Because remember in all of these states where we have seen increasing funding they have got to mature through the process and so the jobs and work are going to build as we are able to take those funds and put them to work and hopefully put them to shipments of stones. So that visibility and that growing demand was really what\u2019s going to support price increases throughout Vulcan-served markets. Jerry Revich : Heading into \u201820? Tom Hill : Yes. \u201820 and \u201821. Jerry Revich : Perfect. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Schrier with Citi. Suzanne Wood : Hi. Good morning Scott. Scott Schrier : Hi. Good morning. I want to start off with a broad-based question on the guidance and understanding the components that go into it, volumes, price or incrementals. I am curious you have been talking about it in the past several months everybody has that we are going to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way we model weather in there that not every day is going to be a blue sky. So, with that in mind, if we have more normalized weather this year, does that mean we hit the midpoint of guidance straight and when I say normalized, I mean maybe a little bit less of the rain that we have had. Does that mean we hit the midpoint of that guidance or does that mean we are more at the high-end? I just want to see how you thought about that in the context of your guidance. Tom Hill : You know, I think when we put the guidance together, we were thoughtful in our guidance about the weather impact knowing that the last couple of years we have seen wetter weather. I think if you look at the last two quarters, it gives me a lot of confidence in that guidance and I will give you two, three reasons why. One, the price increases continue to accelerate and we have got a lot of confidence in that. Two our sales volumes in the fourth quarter were really strong in spite of wet weather and a little -- that being said, that tells me that the contractors have got big backlogs and they have got to get work done. When the sun comes out, they got to make hay and we saw some of them really execute on that in Q4. And the third, as we talked about earlier, our operators executed with real discipline in the face of higher fuel costs and tough wet conditions in the fourth quarter and we will carry that forward. So, as we look into \u201819, I think that guidance I think we were thoughtful about weather and maybe some other headwinds and what we have to do regardless of the outside forces to make sure that we make our guidance. Scott Schrier : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to follow up earlier on the cost question, obviously, you had very strong results in the quarter, 75% incremental. It was a pretty easy comp, so you talked about the diesel and even with that you are up on a two to -- both at for two years and three years on your cash gross profit per ton understanding 5% like-for-like pricing obviously helps. I am just curious, in this particular quarter, is there anything else that we should consider whether there is any kind of inventory build or anything in there? And then, going forward into \u201819, should we be taking into account any consideration outside of normal trends for inventory builds or stripping costs or anything of that like? Suzanne Wood : Yes. Sure. I will -- I will try to address just your first point on whether the comps were easier or not. I mean we have talked about a lot of the pressures that we had -- cost pressures we had this year and in particular in fourth quarter those continued. Our diesel fuel pricing was actually or our diesel fuel costs were actually higher this year in fourth quarter than last year. We had, even though we didn\u2019t call them out, because we are trying to perhaps move away a bit from calling out some of these, what I consider to be sort of relatively small items unless it\u2019s material and unless it\u2019s trend-worthy. So we didn\u2019t go through a detailed weather exercise in the fourth quarter. Although, I think for those of us who watch the weather channel obsessively it certainly was pretty wet in fourth quarter. So I think again with $5 million more in diesel fuel with some disruption from rail where we had to truck items around quarter-over-quarter, I think, that that increase in EBITDA of $53 million was pretty real. I am not sure that I would necessarily consider that to be the easiest comp in the whole wide world. You also raised the question on inventory in the fourth quarter and what we did with respect to that, and look, our inventory is based on production planning that we do every single week. We put together that production plan based on the demand picture that we see what is in our backlog and what we expect very near-term shipments to be. And so, in the quarter we had a very slight inventory build, it was around 3 million tons or so, the delta between Q4 \u201817 and Q4 \u201818 and that had less than -- certainly less than a $10 million impact. It is mostly fixed cost that you are talking about. So pretty minor stuff with respect to that and again it was on the basis of what we expected those really near-term shipments to be and I am glad we did it. Tom, do you have anything to add? Tom Hill : No. I think you covered that well. Thank you. Scott Schrier : Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate all the detail and the color, and then, obviously, congrats on a strong finish to a challenging year and good luck. Suzanne Wood : Okay. Thank you, Scott. Operator : We will take our next question from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Thompson : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. Suzanne Wood : Hi Kathryn. Tom Hill : Good morning. Kathryn Thompson : Good morning. One is just a follow-up on California, and it really has to do more with conversations that we have had with a variety of different industry contacts in the state certainly are seeing a good flow of infrastructure projects, but leading into the November it\u2019s our impression that we are really now seeing more the benefits of local measures and haven\u2019t really seen the full effect of SB-1, would love to get your color on that commentary and your thoughts on the local measure versus seeing the SB-1 momentum right now. Thank you. Tom Hill : Yeah. I think your question was, are we seeing the impact of SB-1 and the local measures or either, what\u2019s the question? Kathryn Thompson : Are you seeing -- yeah. Are you seeing a greater impact of local measures right now and is there really more to come with SB-1, I mean... Tom Hill : Yeah. So the answer to your question is, we are seeing both the impact of local measures and SB-1 and in those projects, there is some of the local measures that I named, the 30 projects that we backlogged and the 15 or 20 that we will bid in the next couple of months, so both of those -- both local measures and SB-1are flowing through. I think the bigger impact right now that we have seen in the projects we backlogged has been SB-1. But remember there\u2019s $46 million of that is locals that are coming. So you are right to point out that they will really -- they will start to -- they will start to impact \u201819 though you have much bigger impact in \u201820 and 21 along with SB-1. Kathryn Thompson : Perfect. Thank you. Just wanted to get an update on Aggregates USA integration and really focusing on what progress you are seeing with the revenue synergies that you had outlined previously really realistically would be fitting in \u201819 into \u201820, but if you could you just give an update on revenue synergy progress with Aggregates USA? Thank you. Tom Hill : So you know first of all, we continue to be really, really happy with that acquisition. It\u2019s a great strategic fit between their distribution network, our distribution network, their quarries and our quarries and how we piece all of those pieces of the puzzle together. Our execution has been very successful. We are actually ahead of the planned -- quite a bit ahead of the plan on unit margins. We had -- as you know, we had some rail service issues that we experienced in \u201818 that hurt us, but we think we put most of that behind us and as we look at Ag USA, we think \u201819 is shaping up to be a very good year to take full advantage of the synergies between all those operations. Kathryn Thompson : Great. Thank you so much. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Garik Shmois with Longbow. Tom Hill : Good morning, Garik. Suzanne Wood : Good morning, Garik. Garik Shmois : Hi. Good morning. Congratulation on the quarter. Tom Hill : Thanks. Garik Shmois : Yeah. I just want to nitpick a little bit on the volume guidance of 3% to 5%. It is a little bit less than the 6% same store volumes that you put up in 2018. So I just kind of want of reconcile some of the bullishness that you are expressing particularly on the public side versus the expected volume growth in 2019. Just wondering -- I know you had some large project shipments in I think Illinois, Arizona, just wondering if there\u2019s maybe some timing issues that might be weighing on the potential growth in 2019 or if there is any labor constraints or anything else that you might be able to call out that is underpinning the guidance? Tom Hill : As I have talked about in the range, I think, we try to be very thoughtful as we went into \u201819 about both weather -- maybe wetter weather or weather issues, also as you just called out, very thoughtful on the timing of large projects. So -- and so that we wouldn\u2019t maybe have to have those big swings. But I think that we are confident in that guidance. We feel good about it. The private side continues to be healthy. We see growth across our footprint in the private side and the public side, as we said, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s our best estimate, educated estimate of the timing of those projects with new funding. As always, that can accelerate or slip and so that would be the delta in the range and also, like I said, we have had wet weather for the last two years and we try to be thoughtful about that also. Garik Shmois : Okay, understood. And just a follow-up, just on volumes and just the cadences as you expect it to progress over the course of the year, understanding you don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance. But you do have some tougher comparisons in the middle of the year. So just wondering if maybe you can maybe help us with expectations on how the volumes are expected to progress. Tom Hill : I don\u2019t see \u201819 as a cadence any different from any other year. The first quarter is always just dicey and so weather dependent. Second quarter we start to build as the construction season comes on. Third quarter is usually the strongest quarter, obviously, we have gotten blown up a few -- for the last couple of years with hurricanes. But we -- and then the fourth quarter again can be very good if you carry weather forward. So I wouldn\u2019t see the changing any at all, and I think, we have got backlogs of good solid both public and private jobs, some of which are large -- some of which are large and we are already shipping. So I think that we may have a little bit better clarity on the timing of large projects than maybe we had in \u201817 or \u201818, but the cadence through the year of shipments, I wouldn\u2019t expect any big changes to it. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. I will just add to that. I agree with what Tom said as part of coming in relatively new here. One of the things that I spent time looking at is really how -- I looked at it not just on a revenues basis but also from an EBITDA basis in terms of what is the phasing during the year. You are right, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but I found it interesting that if you go back for a three year historical period or a five year historical period and you sort of look at how these things -- how our business phases by quarter. It\u2019s actually a much more narrow band than you might think it is. So I would encourage you to go back and just have a look at it in that historical way. Yes, there will always be some puts and takes between quarters but it\u2019s a bit tighter than you might think. Garik Shmois : Okay. We will do that. Thanks again and best of luck. Suzanne Wood : Sure. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Phil Ng : Hey guys. Suzanne Wood : Hi. Good morning, Phil. Tom Hill : Good morning. Phil Ng : Good morning. You are expecting a pretty noticeable uptick in pricing for your Aggregates business. But if pricing falls let\u2019s say a little short, closer to the lower end of the range that you have highlighted. Do you have enough levers on the efficiency front to kind of deliver your 60% incremental margin target? Tom Hill : Short answer to your question is yes. And I feel a lot more confident about that based on the performance of our operators and their improvement in efficiencies in the second half of 2018. They worked very hard on focusing on those efficiencies, particularly in our larger operations and now we are carrying it through all of our operations as we head into \u201819. So I think we feel very confident that our cost will pull-through no matter -- that our costs will come in as expected, no matter what gets thrown at us, and quite candidly that\u2019s what our operators will tell you their job is. Phil Ng : Okay. That\u2019s excellent. And I guess, when you think about government shutdown risk, that\u2019s obviously dissipating right now, but how do you think about the prospect that the two parties come together and get an infrastructure bill negotiated this year and what\u2019s the risk that projects get delayed on the public side next year with funding winding down on the federal side by 2020 if no new bill gets passed? Thanks. Tom Hill : The short answer is shutdown was really no impact. We had a few states that pushed jobs back about a few months into later lettings, but really no impact on us, and as you know, the Feds already distributed the funding for \u201819. On the federal highway bill what we know this, is that House T&I Chairman Peter DeFazio is working hard on an infrastructure bill. DeFazio wants to solve the Highway Trust Fund issue. We for sure want to support him in that and our country needs that. So the need is there, both parties want this to happen. But I wouldn\u2019t venture to guess what\u2019s going to happen with that yet. Now if -- as we go into \u201820 and we have seen -- I don\u2019t see any pushback or problems with the FAST Act in \u201820. If you get to the end of it, it runs out, the Feds are not going to let funding go down they are not going to let it to be unfunded. Now that gives some -- I believe in \u201821 that will give some -- maybe some short-term views for problems for DOTs. But remember you also have massive state and local funding improvements and as we called out in the prepared remarks, the federal highway bill is $45 million. That\u2019s not going to go away, but in our markets -- per year, but in our markets, $45 billion, excuse me, but in our markets you have an improvement of another $20 billion per year that\u2019s just now starting to flow through in increase. So I am always worried about the Highway Trust Fund. It\u2019s something we work hard on. It\u2019s something everybody needs. But I think we will be fine as long as our federal government works hard to fix that problem and it may take some time and some effort to fix, but I believe it will be fixed. Phil Ng : Okay. Thanks a lot. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Suzanne Wood : Hi. Good morning. Stanley Elliott : Good morning guys. Thank you all for fitting me in. Quick question, when you talk about the CapEx piece and you mentioned kind of the extra $200 million of growth CapEx. How long do you foresee that -- the plans, I guess, on a go-forward basis, because at some point, right? I mean you are going to be close to the low end of your leverage target by the end of this year. Certainly by next year for sure and depending upon kind of that swing flex piece on the CapEx side, it could leave you guys in a pretty interesting situation? Suzanne Wood : No. That\u2019s right and good for you for getting to that math quickly. You are right. If you run that through we will be well within that that 2 times to 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA debt band that we always talk about or leverage brand. I think it\u2019s management\u2019s responsibility to make sure that we have a good balance sheet structure and we have a responsible, somewhat conservative leverage target. I believe we absolutely have those in place. I think it\u2019s also our responsibility to create as much flexibility and optionality as we can for the company and I think being well within that leverage target certainly gets us there. If we find ourselves approaching the low end of the leverage band or even outside it, as we go forward, what we would, I mean, we will go back to our capital allocation priorities. I mean that\u2019s really why we have those in place and there is a priority waterfall to them which is investing in our same-store growth. It is the least risky and it is the most profitable for us. Then we look to internal growth projects that are high returning. Then we potentially look to M& A being very disciplined in our approach to that. It\u2019s got to be strategic and it\u2019s got to add value to the company and have a high return and failing that then we have the opportunity to return excess cash to shareholders. So I think our view now is that we want to set ourselves up to have that flexibility and optionality with the cash and as we begin to approach that point, I am sure at the board level, we will have -- be having discussions about exactly how to invest that cash and how to distribute it in such a way that we will drive shareholder value and so I would characterize it as a quality problem to have. Stanley Elliott : Yeah. No doubt. And then last one, do we still think about kind of the business kind of the 255 million tons kind of a mid-cycle number or normalized number that equates to $8.25 cash gross profit per ton or have those numbers changed either through internal efficiencies, better logistics, a larger footprint, anything like that would be helpful. Tom Hill : Fundamentally, we still think about it the same way. I think if you would ask us five years ago, where are you on that curve, I would tell you a tale of two different answers. One I think we would have thought that some of the public would have come on earlier and we may be a little ahead, we would have been a little bit ahead of volume. If you look to unit margins, based on where we are with these volumes, we are ahead of the curve I think and moving up rapidly. So, but fundamentally the answer to your question is yes that\u2019s still the way we look at it. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. Thank you. Appreciate it. Best of luck. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Suzanne Wood : Good morning Adam. Adam Thalhimer : Thanks guys. Suzanne Wood : Good morning, Adam. Adam Thalhimer : Good morning and congrats on a great Q4. Tom Hill : Thank you, Adam. Adam Thalhimer : I wanted to zero in on the M&A pipeline first, Tom, do you think this is a good environment, I mean the privates want to sell right now and then are you seeing large companies for sale small companies for sale or both? Tom Hill : I don\u2019t -- the timing of that is always you got to watch whatever comes up when it comes up and you can\u2019t control the timing of M&A projects. There are some buzzers around out there. We are always looking at those. But it goes back to our simple answer which is discipline, choose the markets you want to be in, what are the synergies that are unique to Vulcan, what can we do with it, make sure you buy it at a price that is reasonable and once you get it, make sure you integrate it effectively, efficiently and fast. So we are always looking, there is always something bubbling out there, but the timing of that and the disciplines are key. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. And then also wanted to ask you about the Texas Gulf Coast, you mentioned that quickly, but can you give us some additional color on what you are seeing there and what impact that could have on your business in \u201819 and \u201820? Tom Hill : Yeah. So Houston really saw a downturn in \u201817 -- kind of late \u201816 early into \u201817. It has rebounded both on the public side, and then in Texas you also got added to that massive funding in highway projects throughout Texas, many of those are along the Gulf Coast, including the best part in Houston. So economy and demand in Gulf Coast and in Houston will be very healthy we think in \u201819 and \u201820 driven by both the public side and the private side. Now there are also along the Gulf Coast both in Texas and Louisiana there\u2019s a lot of projects in the pipeline at various stages of development from an energy perspective, particularly LNG and refinery expansion. We are tracking 10 of those projects right now in Louisiana and Texas. It\u2019s a little early predict for \u201819 when -- at where we are in \u201819, when those projects will ship. Now these tend to be very large, very fast projects that are right in our wheelhouse because of our unique Blue Water capability and the massive delivery you can do in one swath with those 60,000 tons ships. We believe we will see a lot of these projects start in the next two to three years. We may see a little bit of that in volume at the end of the second half of \u201819, but I wouldn\u2019t make a call on that at this point. But it\u2019s in the pipeline and we will follow it and we think they are going to go but the timing and that\u2019s permeating in all those kinds of things we just wait and see, but good stuff to come along the Louisiana and Texas Coast. Adam Thalhimer : Perfect. Thanks Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : Great. Thanks. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Tom Hill : Hi, Brent. Brent Thielman : Good morning. May be back on the growth CapEx, if you sort of look at the slate of other internal things you could be doing over the next 12 months. I am curious sort of the sensitivity to that estimate for the year, could it be far too modest if you just pull a trigger on a few of those items, call it, prospective kind of near-term investments? Suzanne Wood : Yeah. No. It\u2019s a very good question, I mean, again, we went through that thoughtfully, we went sort of project-by-project talking about the ones we might kick off in \u201819. Although, I will tell you a lot of the money set aside for \u201819 is really to finish off projects that were begun in \u201817 and \u201818 because some of those are sort of what I will call long lived projects, particularly as it relates to opening new quarries in markets that are going to be really important to us like California, South Carolina and Texas. So we have put together what we think is an appropriate level of guidance in spending $200 million, we will look at if other projects are brought to us to look at that we think might be incredibly meaningful and returns enhancing to the customer, I mean, to our company then we will certainly consider that and we will keep you updated on that as we go forward through the quarter, but we are pretty comfortable with the $200 million that we have given at this point for \u201819. Tom Hill : Yeah. I\u2019d add to that that remember these -- the greenfield projects are some of our highest returns. They are like an -- they take a long time to do. They are very expensive to get permitted and get up and take years, but once you get them, it\u2019s decades and decades long quarry. They look like an acquisition without paying the blue sky. They also take a little longer to ramp up, but once you get one of those quarries developed, the returns are quite enhancing. Brent Thielman : Okay. Appreciate that. And then maybe a follow-up back on Asphalt, I think, Suzanne, you mentioned sort of this gradual impact of offsetting the higher liquid asphalt costs as you go through these contracts. This isn\u2019t -- you guys have been through this many times before obviously. But would 2019 look any different than past cycles where you have seen these costs fluctuate maybe because of jobs you are working on are larger than usual? Tom Hill : I wouldn\u2019t think they look a lot different from past cycles. I have seen too many of these to count I think. But I wouldn\u2019t say you look a lot different than other cycles. The big question is, we have seen liquids stabilize. We think it will maybe stay at where it is or maybe come up a little bit in the year, but not the big spike in ramp up that we saw through \u201818 and in doing that you will have that time which we are already catching up on to raise prices and get that material margin where it ought to be. I think we are already seeing that. I believe that based on our hot mix prices and our liquid prices, but I\u2019d also tell you, the first quarter is a tough barometer there because the Asphalt business is just tough in the first quarter. The weather keeps just cold and wet so it keeps just -- so the tale of that will be how do we -- how does that come across in Q2 and we will have obviously better visibility of that when we get to the end of the first quarter. Brent Thielman : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you. Suzanne and I are very proud of the performance our operators and our teams did in the fourth quarter and the second half of \u201818. We carried that momentum into \u201819 and it gives us a lot of confidence in our guidance. But we want to thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials and we look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Thanks for joining us today. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Justin, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow their prepared remarks. Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations homepage of the website. A recording of this call will be available for replay at our website later today. Additionally, you can sign-up to receive future news releases under e-mail alerts found in the quick links on the Investor Relations homepage. Please be reminded, the comments regarding the company\u2019s results and projections may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with our other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company\u2019s earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan. We had a solid start to the year, a 15% improvement in adjusted EBITDA and a 11% improvement in Aggregates\u2019 gross profit per ton. These results highlight the combined strength of our aggregates-focused business, our geographic footprint and our sharp focus on improving unit margins. As you know, the principal drivers of our Aggregates\u2019 profitability are volume, price and operational efficiencies, so I\u2019ll address each of these in turn. First, Aggregates\u2019 shipments in the quarter increased by 13%, or 11% on a same-store basis. Importantly, the improvement was broad-based across our footprint. Of course, with record rainfall, California was the obvious exception, but with that said, reduced shipments in the West were more than offset by double-digit volume growth in our core markets in the East and Southeast and in Texas. As we expected, some of the year-over-year improvement in these markets was due to pent-up demand from last year. This was evidenced by significantly higher shipments in January. Shipments in February, March were more in line with our full-year guidance. Overall, the pace of shipments in the first quarter clearly shows that demand is healthy. The second profitability driver is price. And as predicted, our pricing continued to compound from the fourth quarter. On a freight-adjusted basis, pricing improved by 5.4% from last year. On a mix-adjusted basis, pricing increased by 5.8%. As with volume improvements, our pricing gains were widespread. The third driver, and one that is sometimes overlooked, relates to operational efficiencies and cost control. Much of our time and attention is focused here, because it represents an area, where we can strongly influence the outcome. One of our key financial metrics is same-store flow-through. On a trailing 12-month basis, it was 57% at the end of March, in line with our 60% long-term guidance. As we look forward to the rest of this year, our view of our markets remains on track with earlier expectations. We\u2019re still seeing growth in private demand in Vulcan-served markets. In the public sector, demand continues to grow and the increases in state and local highway funding, which we\u2019ve seen across our footprint are turning into shipments. As we pointed out previously, we\u2019re in the very early stages of big growth in highway demand. 10 Vulcan states that generate approximately 80% of our revenue have passed infrastructure legislation over the last four years. These laws have raised funding by almost 50% over 2015 levels. The most recent state to join this stream was Alabama, which passed a gas tax in March. The pace of conversion of public funding and lettings in the shipments continues to accelerate. We see this strengthen our backlog and booking pace, and this also supports a healthy pricing environment, which we experienced in the quarter and can also see going forward. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Suzanne for some additional color on the results. Suzanne? Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. I\u2019ll cover a few additional items and then comment on our 2019 guidance. In first quarter, our same-store unit cost of sales increased year-over-year by 3%. The increase resulted in part from planned higher repair and maintenance costs. We are keenly focused on reducing downtime in our plants in order to improve our operational efficiencies and throughput in the upcoming seasonally stronger quarters. In addition, California experienced higher than expected production costs due to record rainfall. Our SAG costs were higher than last year as a result of the timing of certain expenses. For the full-year, we\u2019ll be in line with our previously provided guidance. On a trailing 12-month basis, these costs continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue and will remain focused on leveraging this part of our cost base. With respect to the Asphalt segment, gross profit was lower than last year, but in line with our expectations. Shipments increased by 5% on a same-store basis and pricing also increased by 5%. Unfortunately, these gains weren\u2019t enough to offset the 29%, or $9 million increase in liquid asphalt costs. Concrete gross profit declined slightly compared to last year. Lower than anticipated shipments due to weather in Virginia were partially offset by modest price increases. For the full-year, our outlook for the non-aggregates segment remains unchanged, as the first quarter is seldom indicative, particularly for asphalt. I\u2019d like to move on now to the balance sheet and our cash flows. Our debt structure suits our business well. Our long-term debt reflects the weighted average debt maturity of 15 years and the weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. We intend to retain our investment-grade credit rating, and accordingly, the target range for our leverage ratio is 2 to 2.5 times. Currently, we are at 2.6 times, but expect to be within the range this year. On Page 7 of the supplemental slides, you\u2019ll find information on our discretionary cash flow expectation for the full-year, using the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance as the starting point. As a reminder, we define discretionary cash flow as EBITDA less working capital change, interest, taxes and operating and maintenance capital. On this basis, our discretionary cash flow for 2019 is projected to approximate $735 million. Using our capital allocation priorities, we can then determine the most returns-enhancing use of that cash, whether it\u2019s for internal growth projects, M&A, dividends, share repurchases or debt reduction. So as you consider your models, I\u2019ll share a couple of numbers with you. In 2019, we expect to spend approximately $250 million on operating and maintenance capital, in line with our prior estimate. With respect to internal growth projects, our investment plan calls for $200 million, which is down about $50 million from 2018 spend and in line with earlier guidance. Turning now to an update on 2019 earnings guidance. Simply put, our view remains consistent with our February outlook. The trends in our backlog project work, our booking pace and customer confidence continues to support our positive outlook for the remainder of this year. As Tom said, our first quarter results were definitely a solid start, but we should keep in mind that it was first quarter, which is the smallest quarter of the year due to seasonality and thus, the least likely to affect our overall outcome for the full-year. The takeaway is that, we are generally where we expected to be at the end of March, having employed a thoughtful approach to our guidance earlier this year. We therefore reaffirm our full-year expectations for 2019 adjusted EBITDA. As a reminder, that guidance range is between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion. All other more detailed aspects of the guidance are shown on Page 8 in the supplemental slides. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks. Thomas Hill : Thanks, Suzanne. I\u2019m very proud of our people\u2019s performance in the first quarter. And I want to take this opportunity to thank our operators and our salespeople for taking care of our customers, holding each other to a high standard of operational excellence and delivering on financial results as promised. A 25% improvement in Aggregates\u2019 gross profit and a 11% improvement in Aggregates\u2019 unit profitability, that\u2019s not easy in a winter quarter. I\u2019m also pleased that we continue to advance our safety culture in 2019 and improve on record-setting 2018 performance. So far this year, our injury rate was 0.85 accidents for 200,000 employee hours worked. Our number one job is to keep our people safe, and this is going to remain a central part of our operating disciplines. As we move forward, we\u2019ll focus on the key elements that deliver value for our customers and our shareholders, and we will keep our people safe and allow our plants to operate at maximum efficiencies. We will execute at the local level and will drive unit margin expansion. We have the best geographic footprint in the industry, and our business model and our people are flexible enough to take care \u2013 to take advantage of market opportunities and resilient enough to overcome market challenges. Our first quarter was a good step in the right direction towards achieving our 2019 goals. Now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Schrier with Citi. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Scott. Scott Schrier : Hey, Tom, good morning and nice quarter. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Scott Schrier : So I want to start off with a bigger picture question. Obviously, due to the structure of the business, aggregates, particularly well-run aggregates businesses can come in higher multiples on peers. But with concerns about the cycle that really took hold towards the end of last year, one thing that supports a higher multiple is an elongated cycle, which comes from visibility and from the larger type projects, and I know you talked about it, Tom, in your prepared remarks. Can you speak to the visibility we have right now and the growth trajectory? How long does this last? I mean, assuming, of course, the $2 trillion a quarter century plan discussed the other day, I think, the one you\u2019re aware. I know in the past you\u2019ve laid out things like mid-cycle EBITDAs. What\u2019s mid-cycle EBITDA? When does this happen? What \u2013 how much visibility do we have right now into the extension of the cycle? Thomas Hill : All right. What we said was mid-cycle, we\u2019d about 255 million tons. And if you look at the cycle right now, let\u2019s take it in pieces. On the public side, we\u2019re stronger than we would have predicted five years ago. You\u2019ve got substantial funding from states. In fact, that funding in our states is up some 60% over 2015 level. So and \u2013 and not much of that is flowed through yet. So you\u2019ve got four, five years of big growth in highway demand. Turning to the private side. On the residential, we see \u2013 we\u2019ve continued to see growth in the residential in our markets. Our customers feel good about single-family growth. Looking out, we see exciting markets with housing growth and a few that we\u2019re watching. What I\u2019d put on the watch list would be San Francisco, Nashville and Chicago. Exciting markets would be Houston, Southern California, Tampa, Jacksonville, all of Florida, a lot of the Southeast. So the fundamentals of residential growth are still in place, population growth, employment growth in very low inventories of houses. So in our footprint, we still see growth in res. I would call out non-res very similar. Our backlogs, our booking pace are strong \u2013 we\u2019re shipping strong, our customers outlook is positive on non-res. So, we still see strength both on the private side and the public side. Scott Schrier : Thanks. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask a couple of things on the cost front. Obviously, you\u2019ve got some fixed cost absorption in California. You had the repair and maintenance. Looks like we also had some inventory build. So if I\u2019m thinking about the cadence of the year, how can we think about some of those items? And I know that also in the past, sometimes you\u2019ve given us a cash gross profit per ton bridge. I\u2019m wondering if you could potentially walk us through that for the quarter? Thomas Hill : Yes. So, it was \u2013 I would describe it as a typical cold, wet quarter. And our costs were up about 3%. About 1% of that was the impact of severe weather in California. I\u2019d also add to that, that our California team did an excellent job managing their cost in really tough headwinds. The rest was \u2013 the majority of the rest was planned maintenance to get ready for the season, and that\u2019s very typical for our first \u2013 for a cold, wet quarter. You\u2019re just going to be inefficient in trying to crush rock when it\u2019s cold and wet. So you fix it while the weather is bad and run it when the weather is good. So we did a lot of R&M, planned R&M in preparation for the season. We actually had a reduction in inventory, which was a little bit of a headwind for us. And again, that\u2019s not unusual in a cold, wet quarter. You shutdown the planned R&M, because you\u2019re not going to be efficient running. And I think our people have done a good job with inventories. If you look back, we\u2019ve actually, over the last four, five years, we\u2019ve actually lowered inventories of long sizes, which will be based in fines, and that\u2019s really taken our inventory and that we\u2019re all returning it to cash. Our inventory turns have continued to move up over the last four, five years. Suzanne Wood : Yes. And I would just add to that, Scott. I can see where you\u2019ve got the question about inventory being higher. If you look at it on a year-over-year basis on the balance sheet, it does appear to be higher, but that\u2019s as a result of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done year-over-year one \u2013 reasonably sized one in the paving and asphalt side of the business. I think from the production cost standpoint in the quarter, the \u2013 probably the better way to look at it is to look at what your inventory actually did in the quarter. So if you look at the balance sheet, you can actually see a decline in finished product there. Scott Schrier : Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it and good luck. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : And next will be Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Nishu Sood : Thank you. Yes, good morning. I wanted to start off kind of digging into the commentary you mentioned about the backlogs \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the deferred projects that benefited 1Q. February and March are more in line with your long \u2013 your year guidance for low to mid single-digit volume growth, whereas January was much stronger. I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. January, I would anticipate would be much smaller volume-wise and February and particularly March. So it just implies some really strong volume growth in January. Am I understanding that correctly? So how strong was January? And then what does that speak to in terms of momentum carrying out of the quarter? Thomas Hill : Yes. So, the shipments overall in the quarter is a robust first quarter. And that volume growth, which is very encouraging was very widespread with the obvious exception of California, which was just a washout. As we said, the big jump came in January. It was high double-digit. And if you remember, when we made comments on the third quarter, we said we had a lot of pent-up demand and some of that may flow-through into 2019. That\u2019s actually what happened in January. It was as predicted, again, February and March were more in line with our guidance. What we\u2019re seeing out there is a real sense of urgency from our customers to get work completed, so they can get on to their growing backlogs. And this was really evidenced in the first quarter as the weekend shipments were up 25% year-over-year. And what that signals is, those customers got to get the work done and they\u2019re willing to spend over time to get on to the next project. The private continues to move up, as we said, where the big increase we\u2019re seeing in is in highway shipments and the flow-through of that funding. And I \u2013 as we said, that increase in funding flow-through will continue for the next four, five years. I think that as far as the rest of the year, as predicted, I would expect shipments to be more like February, March, but remember, it\u2019s still just the first quarter. Nishu Sood : Got it, got it. I appreciate the details there. And then second question, one of the impressive thing about the numbers is the low double-digit aggregates volume growth, despite your largest market California being down double digits. You mentioned it was broad-based. How much did the Aggregates USA footprint, which would have been less weather affected, perhaps impact that? So just how were you \u2013 if you could dig into how you\u2019re able to offset the double-digit declines in your largest market with the rest of your footprint? What were the particular drivers of strength or regions? Thomas Hill : Well, I think that everywhere except for California saw strength, particularly in our very important Southeast market. We\u2019re the largest producer in the Southeast, and we really, really benefited from big demand in those Southeastern states. It was just widespread. And again, you had some big projects scattered out across that flowed from fourth quarter last year into first quarter this year and that was really what you saw in January. Nishu Sood : Got it. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Sure. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Kathryn. Kathryn Thompson : Hi, Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking\u2026 Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Kathryn Thompson : \u2026thank you for taking my questions today. Just \u2013 so first on the follow-up on CapEx. Could you give us a little bit more color on the $55 million spend for internal growth projects and expected returns? So there\u2019s looking \u2013 building out new sites. But just wanted to get some more color on what type of growth projects you\u2019re targeting for this? Suzanne Wood : Sure. I\u2019ll address that one, Kathryn. In terms of the growth projects and what we spent on in the quarter, they are largely \u2013 the spend was largely on what we\u2019ve outlined before we are opening some additional sales and distribution networks in certain parts of the country, along the Gulf Coast into Charleston as well to sort of help expand the network there. We are also expending money on the opening of two or three greenfield sites, one of which is in California. And we would expect and that one to hopefully begin having a few shipments from that late this year. In terms of returns, we don\u2019t go into the specifics of the returns on those individual projects other than to say that they are definitely accretive to the returns of the company and have a higher return than what we \u2013 what the company generates overall. And that\u2019s the main reason for doing those projects. As you look at an internal growth project versus M&A, this is a way to get exactly what you want, where you want it without potentially having to pay a lot of blue sky. And when you are able to do it internally, it causes the return on investment to rise. Thomas Hill : I would add to that. There\u2019s a ramp-up time for these just because when you buy something it\u2019s already going to this when you have to ramp-up. But they\u2019re adjacent or in our footprint, so they\u2019re additive to the franchise and protect the franchise and there are some of our highest returns that \u2013 you\u2019re not painting the blue sky, but you also the flip side as it takes a little time to ramp-up. Kathryn Thompson : Okay, perfect. And then a follow-up on ASPs. Nice job in the quarter. Thank you also for confirming that. You didn\u2019t build inventory and it does look that from an industry standpoint, at least, from the folks we\u2019ve \u2013 with whom we\u2019ve spoken. In general there has not been an inventory build in Q1 this year to the same degree as last year. Just a confirmation that this certainly should be positive for pricing going forward? And then second, on a follow-up to that, could you just give more quantification or color on the commentary of project type mix in the quarter and how this impacted pricing for the quarter? And really more importantly, how you think it will \u2013 how it impacts it as we look further out 12 to 18 months from now? Thank you very much. Thomas Hill : Yes, thank you. The quarter \u2013 the pricing momentum in our markets continues to improve. This was, as we predicted, third quarter, fourth quarter last year. The mix was about 40 basis points. All of that was base, which a higher base refines in a cold wet weather is not unusual. It\u2019s also indicative of new highway construction. But overall, we\u2019re seeing widespread pricing momentum across our vast majority of our markets. In fact, all the one market \u2013 every market we reinstall price increases, they\u2019re for one and that one was flat. The \u2013 I think the foundation of this is the visibility to that highway growth and the continued demand growth and shipping growth on the private side. Our January and April price increases to fixed plants were all in place. And we\u2019ll see bid work push up throughout the year. And as you know, bid work is a campaign over time, it\u2019s not a one-time price increase. So the 2019 price increases came out of the gate strong. But I think what\u2019s really important here is, it provides a good start to our improve unit margins. As we said, those unit margins were up a 11% in the quarter. And this is the second quarter in a row that we\u2019ve grown unit margins in the face of some pretty tough conditions. And that\u2019s simply sound execution and disciplines under difficult circumstances by our people. And if you remember, if you kind of look back over time, this is usual for us. If you look back six years, we\u2019ve gone from $3 \u2013 roughly $3 to just under $3 to almost $5 from the trailing 12-month basis on unit margins, that\u2019s 12% compounded annual growth rate and we saw 11% in the first quarter. So my hats off to our sales and ops folks and we thank them for that. And this is our job and we\u2019ll keep looking at it. Suzanne Wood : Yes. I just add one thing there, Kathryn, going back to the commentary around base sales and the fact that our \u2013 that produced a bit of unfavorable product mix of about 40 basis points. Our base sales did increase pretty substantially in the first quarter year-over-year. Last year, they constituted about 22%, this year, about 27%. So that\u2019s about 500 bps up. So to \u2013 given that significant increase to only have a product mix effect of about 40 basis points, I think is pretty good. Kathryn Thompson : Yes, perfect. Thank you so much. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Benjamin Burud : Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Ben Burud on for Jerry. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Ben. Suzanne Wood : Hi, Ben. Benjamin Burud : Good morning. Just wanted to touch on pricing. So if we look back to last year, pricing improved over the course of 2018. So as a result, you\u2019ll probably be facing tougher comps in the second-half. As a result, obviously you had very strong pricing 5.8% year-over-year, excluding mix. Should we think about pricing kind of steady over the course of the year, or does that comp \u2013 the second-half comp present a meaningful headwind? Thomas Hill : I think you nailed it. I think, we would expect our price increases to be steady throughout the year in line with our guidance. And you have to remember, so we \u2013 the fixed plants, as I said, went into effect in January and April. You\u2019ll see some \u2013 some of those you\u2019ll see mid-year price increases. But the bid work, which is the majority of our work, as I said, is a campaign over time, and we\u2019ll continue to push that up throughout the year. And you got to remember, we were looking at our backlogs and our booking pace and our pricing, our book pace, and it will support that 5% to 7% guidance that we\u2019ve given, and I would see that smoother in 2019, whereas it was kind of a ramp-up in 2018. Benjamin Burud : Got it. And this kind of feeds into the mid-cycle question you addressed earlier, but I appreciate that it\u2019s a few quarters away. But can you kind of give us an idea how you\u2019re thinking about pricing in 2020? It\u2019s obviously very strong this year. Can we keep that momentum into 2020 and continue that path to a strong mid-cycle level of performance? Thomas Hill : I think I would turn that to \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re not going to give you guidance for 2020, it\u2019s too early. We\u2019re still in first stages of 2019. But I think what I would look at there is what drives price and its visibility and work that\u2019s coming, so people secure that they can take price in and give prices out there in the marketplace. And that is what so important about the growing highway demand. It is \u2013 everybody knows it\u2019s there. It\u2019s very visible. They know way out in advance what\u2019s coming. And so whereas private work in is helpful there, but it\u2019s a little less visibility and a little less sure than a state saying they\u2019re going to do XYZ jobs. So I would predict pricing to continue \u2013 the momentum to continue to increase over time underpins again by the visibility to highway demand. Benjamin Burud : Got it. And if I could just squeeze in one quick follow-up on that note. Obviously, the infrastructure demand is very, very positive. There\u2019s nothing that you guys see looking out that would represent a downside risk to the current infrastructure demand, kind of like what we saw in 2017 where there were project delays or engineering constraints. Is that not the case this time around? Thomas Hill : There\u2019s enough flowing through, I would expect it to be a little smoother. You got to remember, we were back to 2017, that was just a couple of states that had new highway bills. Now we\u2019ve got 10 of our states that have all passed increased funding, that funding increases $20 billion a year versus over 10 states, where the federal bill is $45 billion a year over 50 states. So this is substantial. It\u2019s big. It\u2019s widespread. And I think will there be air pockets of how fast it grows by or it will be, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be a smooth go up. I would expect it to always be going up over the next four or five years, though. Benjamin Burud : Awesome. I appreciate the color. Thomas Hill : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Next will be Phil Ng with Jefferies. Phil Ng : Hey, guys, great quarter. Suzanne Wood : Hi, Phil. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Phil Ng : It seemed like some of the bottlenecks that may have held you back, had started to ease a bit. Curious, your ability to kind of play catch-up, given some of this pent-up demand. And if you continue to see double-digit growth like you did in the quarter, we\u2019re not saying that\u2019s the case for the rest of the year. But if you had that type of growth trajectory, do you have enough bandwidth in inventory to kind of meet that demand? Thomas Hill : Oh, sure. I mean, we had the bandwidth in production capacity. I mean, the capacity is built in these plants to do 300 million tons, it\u2019s just a matter of hours. But we\u2019ll handle whatever comes at us, and we have the power to do that. I\u2019m not at all worried about that, in fact, I\u2019ve loved to have that problem. Phil Ng : Okay, sounds great. And then shifting gears to like California, what are you expecting in terms of how much that market grows this year? There\u2019s certainly some puts and takes. We have already showing some signs of a slowdown and the softer 1Q start, the public sounds quite robust with SB1. And can you remind us what are the splits between private and public for California? Thomas Hill : Yes. The \u2013 obviously, the first quarter in California was a washout, but the fundamentals in California are very strong. You\u2019ve got SB1 coming on with a steadily increasing implementation. Remember, we\u2019re only a year-and-a-half into the funding of SB1. We always tell you, it takes two years. But Caltrans is actually doing a pretty good job in getting work out there. We\u2019ve already backlogged probably 1.5 million tons of aggregates and a 1 million tons of asphalt. And you got to remember, much of that is going to ship this year. Remember, we\u2019re the largest aggregate and asphalt producer in California. So this is right in our wheelhouse. The backlogs and booking pace would support our plan for the year. We will have a good performance in California this year. Time will tell, if we can catch-up on projected volumes in California for 2019 with the works there. Management team actually performed extremely well in a tough quarter with our cost I said earlier. It boils down to, I\u2019m not concerned about California, if anything actually very excited about California, both the demand level on the private side and big demand coming on the public side, our team\u2019s performance. So we\u2019ll have a good year in California. As far as the split, I would tell you, in Southern California, we are more about 50-50, like we are across the country with \u2013 of private versus public. In Northern California, we are \u2013 in Central Northern California, we\u2019re probably heavier on the public side than we are on the private side. Phil Ng : Got it. And just one last one for me. Can you talk about how trends are tracking in April and May? And how extended are your backlogs? I know, one of your competitors mentioned some of their customers and contractors have started to reach out for work in 2020, right? Just curious if you\u2019re seeing some of that as well? Thanks a lot. Thomas Hill : I\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t hear the first of your question. Phil Ng : Can you talk about how your trends are tracking in April and May \u2013 early May? Thomas Hill : Yes. Well Ms. Wood just kick me under the table about what I\u2019ll be trying to talk about April and May. But I would call out the full-year. I would expect our price and volume to track pretty smoothly as what we have in our guidance. Phil Ng : Got it. And then the backlogs, are you having conversations with customers into 2020 already, or how\u2019s that kind of shaking out? Thomas Hill : Well, some of the big work that we\u2019re bidding today will flow into 2020. But most of it\u2019s going to be shipped in 2019. But we \u2013 when we bid work that goes out years to come, we\u2019ll put escalators in it. Phil Ng : Got it. All right, thanks a lot. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : And next will be Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Adam. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Adam Thalhimer : Good morning. Great quarter. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Adam Thalhimer : Tom, sorry to harp on this again, but I\u2019m just curious on the guidance \u2013 the volume guidance with such a strong start to the year. 5% volume guidance would be kind of, I don\u2019t know 3% each quarter for the rest of the year. Is there any some conservatism baked in on your part there? Thomas Hill : Well, I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019d rather have the first \u2013 I\u2019d be rather be ahead on this on the batting than behind. But you got to remember, it\u2019s still the first quarter. And if history repeats itself, we\u2019re going to see some headwinds this year. And you saw February and March ship more like guidance, so it\u2019s a solid start. I think we were thoughtful in our guidance and I still think we\u2019re thoughtful in our guidance. I don\u2019t \u2013 again, it\u2019s a great start. But it\u2019s \u2013 we \u2013 most years, we see some storms and fires and hurricanes in there, and who knows what\u2019s going to happen this year, hopefully not, but we\u2019ll see. Suzanne Wood : Yes. I would just add to that. I mean, I think it\u2019s a little bit early, yes, it was a great start to the year. As Tom said, we did have some pent-up demand coming through in January that propelled the numbers beyond the guidance. We feel comfortable with where we are from a backlogs and booking pace perspective for the rest of the year. But I think only 45 days or so, 60 days or so after we gave the initial guidance that we spent a lot of time thinking about taking all of these factors into effect, it\u2019s probably a bit premature to to go down the path of revising that at this point on the basis of the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. Adam Thalhimer : Okay, understood. And then can you give a little more color on non-res, Tom, particularly the bidding? Thomas Hill : Sure. As we look out, our non-res shipments have been strong. Our customers\u2019 outlook is very positive in non-res. The backlogs and booking pace or good. In non-res, you rarely see all of your markets line up at the same time as strong. So I\u2019d call out markets that we watch out \u2013 we\u2019re watching from a non-res and some excited about the watch list would be \u2013 this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to go down. They are just \u2013 we\u2019re not quite as excited about them as we are others the watch list would be places like Baltimore, Nashville, Dallas markets where we feel very good about our non-res side about, would include Southern California, Atlanta, Phoenix and North Virginia. But I think we\u2019ll continue to see strength in shipments in non-res throughout 2019. Adam Thalhimer : Great. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : And next will be Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to \u2013 first question circle back on one of the earlier questions and comments around cost quantification just on the 3% unit cost. It sounded like 1% was kind of weather impact. So then, if we look at the bulk of the remaining, I think, that would translate to roughly 10-ish million in terms of headwinds from some of the maintenance and repair costs. So first, is that on track? And then second, how should we be thinking about unit cost through the balance of the year as you get back into seasonally stronger periods? Thomas Hill : So that\u2019s a good question. On the call California \u2013 so cost went up 3%, I will look at this way. California was about a percent of that. And even \u2013 now with that said, I think, our folks did a good job, they just had a tough go of it and that happened we had that much rain. The other 2% \u2013 about 1.5% that would be R&M. I said R&M, repair and maintenance and this is we took plants down, because it was not a good time to run. And that\u2019s what we should have been doing and then when the sun comes out, the season will \u2013 we can run at maximum efficiencies. And then inventories was about a 0.5%, and again that was by design and that you don\u2019t need to be trying to build inventories when you have operating efficiency. So that\u2019s how I look at it. As I look through the quarter, I would expect \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t see big shifts in inventories. I wouldn\u2019t expect California to \u2013 the sunshine back sign in the California back running. I think that operating team is very talented and they will do a very good job with that. And our R&M will level as the year goes along and we start running. Mike Dahl : Okay. So flattish in terms of unit costs for the balance of the year, and that\u2019s kind of how you get back to the 60% incrementals, is that fair? Thomas Hill : That\u2019s probably a little better, up a little bit than flat, but in all said, yes, you\u2019re correct. Suzanne Wood : Generally flat, yes. Mike Dahl : Okay. And then my last question, just on the mix commentary, understand the impact of the base from a product standpoint. So if you think about the potential for a rebound in California and the mix of base potentially move a bit lower through the year. How should we be thinking about the overall mix impact within your full-year guide as it relates to the pricing? Thomas Hill : I would expect not a big impact from mix geographically, if anything maybe a little positive of the mix on product mix, I would expect base to continue to be pretty strong, maybe not as strong as it was in Q1. But the reason I say that is, you\u2019ve got a lot of new construction out there with this \u2013 with the highway funding. So and then, by the way, this is a good thing. This is not \u2013 but we\u2019d go back to \u2013 and I\u2019d point you right back to guidance, which is 5 to 7 mix adjusted. Mike Dahl : Great. Okay, thank you. Operator : And next will be Trey Grooms with Stephens. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Trey. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Trey Grooms : Hey, good morning, Tom and Suzanne. So I guess, first off, the \u2013 you mentioned you\u2019re seeing kind of an accelerated or accelerating transition from lettings to actually seeing aggregate shipments. Tom, what in your opinion, what\u2019s driving this? And is it sustainable as we kind of start moving into the busier time here as we look at the backlog that you have, as we look at the states that you\u2019re in and the increase in funding? Is this, I guess, shorter lag between a lettings? And when you guys see work, is that sustainable, or do you see that kind of stretching out again? Thomas Hill : I think, what I see is, this is sustainable. In fact, I think it is going to compound that growth rate over time, as funding within a state matures and then as funding between each state comes online. So I would expect it to be stronger over time. You\u2019re seeing it in our backlogs, you\u2019re seeing it in the highway lettings, you\u2019re seeing it in the highway \u2013 in the state\u2019s highways budgets. It is \u2013 the bottom line of it is, it is the maturing of the DOTs into their funding. And as we said, it takes two years and then it ramps up over time. Suzanne Wood : Yes. I think Tom is exactly right on that. I mean this is just a natural progression. It takes about two years. And so you\u2019re beginning to see come through now some of which we had hoped would have come through last year, but it just takes longer when the projects are initially beginning to ramp up. Trey Grooms : Got it. All right. And then you mentioned January benefiting from some pent-up demand. Is \u2013 was that more kind of the catch-up you\u2019re talking about here, or it was that just weather-related things that didn\u2019t happen last year that kind of pushed into January that was a catch-up period and now we\u2019re back to normal? Thomas Hill : I think, well, the overall growth is what we\u2019re talking about. The bubble, so to speak, in January was work that flowed through from 2018. Trey Grooms : Okay. And so California weather likely created some level of pent-up demand. How should we think about that flow-through? And then also you mentioned Virginia weather impacting ready-mix. Did that impact aggregate shipments as well? And is there any pent-up, I guess, shipments there? Thomas Hill : I\u2019ll tell you Virginia first. The cold wet weather is going to impact ready-mix concrete worse than it is rocks, so we shipped \u2013 we actually shipped a lot of base. Aggregate shipments in Virginia were actually up in spite of the weather. And \u2013 but it was more based in clean stone and that again is very typical for a cold wet quarter. We also did more vertical work last year in ready-mix than we have more flat work this year. It is also \u2013 the flat work is more weather-sensitive. So not worried about Virginia, but Virginia will have a very good year and had a great start with aggregates, but the ready-mix backlogs are there and it will perform. On California, I think it\u2019s this. Again, the booking pace and backlogs in California, both from a volume and a price perspective is excellent. Same thing with our asphalt, with going prices in asphalt will have a very good year in California. The timing of this was such a quarter, I can\u2019t predict yet. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get it all done. Our customers want that to happen with sunshine in there. They\u2019re shipping and they\u2019re busy. But it\u2019s really a matter of do you have enough days and the timing of those projects. But again, that\u2019s a matter of timing. California\u2019s going to have a good years, it\u2019s a matter of whether it\u2019s a good year or great year, but it will be solid. And if we don\u2019t do it in 2019, we\u2019ll do in 2020. Trey Grooms : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats to you and the team on a good quarter. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : And next will be Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Garik. Jeffrey Stevenson : Hey, this is Jeff Stevenson on Garik. Thomas Hill : Oh, hi, Jeff. Suzanne Wood : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Stevenson : Hey, how are you? Thomas Hill : Good. Jeffrey Stevenson : My first question was just a follow-up on California. I was just wondering if you could provide any more color on contractor labor and other capacity issues that might impact demand from getting work through this year? Thomas Hill : Yes. Well, labor is an issue, not just in California, everywhere, and not so much for us. But we have pressures on labor, but we can get it done. It\u2019s really our customers. I think that highway demand growing faster is more labor-efficient, so that will actually help us. But everybody has pressures on labor, but it really affects. And I think \u2013 backing up to the highway, our contracted customers of the highway piece of this have done a good job, building labor forces with the visibility to the work coming. But it will be a constrained and that\u2019s just a piece of the question mark of can we get all work done in 2019, again, it\u2019s a timing issue. But \u2013 so labor is an issue, but we\u2019ll shift past, I think. Jeffrey Stevenson : Okay, great. And then you\u2019d expect that asphalt to make up most of the gross profit improvement in the downstream business. And just wondering if this is tracking in line with your expectations, given liquid asphalt cost of product more than expected. Thomas Hill : Yes. The quarter was actually right in line with our expectations. Prices and hot mix were up 5%, but liquid costs were up $100 a ton for liquid. So liquid cost us in the quarter about $9 million. Now that\u2019s first quarter. If you look back to the fourth quarter, liquid is, as predicted, is pretty much level out and our backlog and our booking pricing on future work for hot mix, it continues to escalate. So we\u2019ll catch this up. It\u2019ll be a ramp up throughout the year. But I think we\u2019re good with our plan, accomplishing our plan. And the big ramp-up in highway demand is very, very important for that asphalt product line, because that\u2019s what most of the painting is. Suzanne Wood : And I would just add to that. In terms of asphalt, when you think about the guidance that we gave for the year back in February, we said that a majority of the improvement in gross profit would come from increased volume. And based on our backlogs and booking paces, as Tom said, we feel pretty comfortable with that right now. And the other point I would make is that, particularly with respect to the first quarter, remember, in California, that is an extremely big asphalt business for us And so, no doubt. While we were pretty much on track with what we expected in first quarter from an asphalt perspective, California, if it hadn\u2019t been raining out there virtually every single day, that would have certainly been helpful as well. So we can look forward to that as the sun begins to shine a bit more. Jeffrey Stevenson : Okay, great. Thank you. Thomas Hill : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And next will be Adrian with JPMorgan. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Hi, good morning, Adrian. Adrian Huerta : Hi, good morning, Tom and Suzanne. Thank you for taking my question. Just two questions. One is, what percentage of your territories you had the price increases in January and what percentage was in April? And the second question is, you did not have much M&A activity in the quarter. Should we expect lower M&A activity this year, probably on higher valuations than what we had last year? Thanks. Thomas Hill : As far as pricing is concerned, it was pretty consistent through the quarter as how the poor turned out and that was as we predicted in the fourth quarter \u2013 for the fourth quarter call. So it was \u2013 and I would expect that throughout the year. As far as M&A, we\u2019re always working on a few of these that\u2019s happening today. It\u2019s always hard \u2013 it\u2019s to predict what\u2019s going to happen M&A as the seller side, when they want to sell and we don\u2019t have a lot of control over that. I think, what I was \u2013 what I look forward for us in M&A is, I\u2019ve said there\u2019s a lot, it\u2019s discipline \u2013 be disciplined about what you\u2019re going to buy and be disciplined about those synergies that are unique to us, try not to pay for those, make sure you don\u2019t overpay pressure test the project. And then once you get it, make sure you integrate it quickly and accurately. Adrian Huerta : Okay. Suzanne Wood : That\u2019s right. And I would also add to that from the M&A perspective. If you look back to the amount of spend we\u2019ve had in M&A over the past 12 to 18 months, it has been pretty sizable for us. And so I think whether there is a deal out there to be done or not, I think, having a relatively quiet quarter to make sure, as Tom said, those are embedded in and we stay very focused on making sure we get off to a really good start in the aggregates business is probably the most important thing for us to have done in the first quarter. Adrian Huerta : Understood, Tom and Suzanne. And you mentioned at the opening three, I think, you said three quarries and one in California. And what are the chances that we could see even more quarries being opened this year? Thomas Hill : I think that quarry took about 10 or 15 years in development. It is \u2013 and it took a lot of work for our local folks. It is extremely hard to open a quarry anywhere much less California. Adrian Huerta : And how big is going to be this quarry in California? Thomas Hill : It\u2019s a mid-range quarry, but I don\u2019t think we want to be public about that at this point. Adrian Huerta : Thank you, Tom. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Next will be Lee Nalley with SunTrust. Lee Nalley : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Thomas Hill : Sure. Lee Nalley : Good morning, good morning. So just a real quick. In the past you guys have discussed leverage target 2 to 2.5 times, I think, you confirmed that last quarter. But prior to that, there are also \u2013 there\u2019s also this target of 1.5 times at the cycle peak. I\u2019m just wondering can you give your kind of updated thoughts on how you manage \u2013 plan to manage leverage through the cycle? And is that 1.5 times target still out there? Suzanne Wood : Yes. Our target range is 2 to 2.5 times through the cycle, and we are comfortable with that. We think that\u2019s an appropriate leverage range. It gives us the the flexibility and stability we need to manage through the cycle, because remember, in the downturn, we will be \u2013 even though EBITDA may fall a bit from fewer shipments, we\u2019ll be very cash-generative, because we\u2019ll basically be spending virtually nothing on growth CapEx. And if we go into the cycle as we plan to with our fleet pretty young, then we will not have to spend very much at all on \u2013 from an operating and maintenance side as well. So that cash profile that\u2019s a little countercyclical to profit gives you some cushion as well. We like to be flexible in what we do. We\u2019re comfortable with the 2 to 2.5 times. But certainly, if we were in the middle of the cycle and felt it was appropriate to reduce the leverage range further, that is certainly within our remit to do. But when you think about our business model, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the 2 to 2.5 times. We\u2019d certainly like to be toward the lower-end or at the lower-end of that range, as you\u2019re entering the downturn. Lee Nalley : Thanks. All that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the clarification. Suzanne Wood : Sure. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks. Thomas Hill : Again, thank you for your time today and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Have a good day. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

My name is John, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials, Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning. And thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow their prepared remarks. Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations homepage of the website. Additionally, a recording of this call will be available for replay at our website later today. Please be reminded, the comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the Company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We truly appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials. Our second quarter results reflected our continued strong performance, a 15% improvement in adjusted EBITDA, and 11% improvement in Aggregates' gross profit per ton. We are relentlessly focused on unit margins. It is one of our most important metrics and it increased in the second quarter by $0.58 to $5.74 per ton. On a trailing 12-month basis, our Aggregates' gross profit per ton has increased at a 12% compounded annual growth rate from the second quarter of 2013. We remain on track to achieve our full year EBITDA expectations. Our overall results for the first half of the year, and the trajectory of the principal drivers of profitability in our Aggregates business, volume, price and cost were in line with our expectations. I'll spend a few minutes giving you some highlights of our performance in these areas. Aggregates' shipments in the quarter increased by 4% year-over-year or 3% on a same-store basis. This growth in volume reflects the solid underlying fundamentals in our markets. Shipments in our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets were particularly strong. California experienced another wet quarter. But despite this, shipments increased compared to the same period last year. Wet weather also affected shipments in Illinois, Tennessee, and Texas. The second driver of our profitability is price and we performed well here also. Freight-adjusted average sales price improved by 5.9%, compared to the same quarter last year. On a mix-adjusted basis, the increase was 5.4%. The 50 basis point difference was due to favorable geographic mix. These increases were in line with our expectation and the pricing gains were widespread. Every key market across our footprint posted improved pricing. Our third key profitability driver center zone, our cost disciplines and our operational efficiencies. Our management teams and our leaders across the company are keenly focused on this. And we're making good progress. We measure our operational efficiencies in a number of ways, but one key financial metric for Aggregates is same-store gross profit flow-through. On a trailing 12-month basis, it was 65% at the end of June. Our operational execution at the plant level keeps improving, and it's rewarding to see that the hard work of our men and women at Vulcan is translating into strong incremental earnings. We will continue to focus on these disciplines, because they are a significant contributor to the quality of our earnings and our ability to compound our unit margins. As we look to the second half of the year, the overall view of our markets is duly unchanged. Shipments in the private construction end markets are good. On the public side, demand is healthy and continues to strengthen with the increases in state and local highway funding being converted into backlogs and shipments. We believe that we are in the early stages of a longer-term growth in highway demand, which is a function of increased state and local investment in infrastructure. Since our last call, another Vulcan state, Illinois has passed legislation to increase revenues for roads. Since 2013, 11 states that make-up 85% of our revenue have increased fuel taxes or increased other ongoing sources of revenue for highways. This supports our positive highway demand outlook and the improved visibility underpins improving pricing. In summary, our backlogs are good, and our geographic footprint and capabilities put us in a strong position to take advantage of market opportunities. Now I'll turn the call over to Suzanne for some additional comments on the results. Suzanne? Suzanne Wood : Thanks and good morning to everyone. As Tom mentioned, our trailing 12-month same-store incremental aggregates flow-through rate of 65% was quite good, while price is certainly an important driver of this metric, I also want to touch on the impact of our operating cost performance. Operating disciplines, accountability and cost management significantly benefited our results again this quarter. Our same-store unit cost of sales increased by less than 2% as compared to the prior year's quarter. The largest single component of this increase related to greater stripping activity, which is a function of anticipated future shipments. This accounted for about 40% of the higher costs. And for information, the effect of diesel fuel cost was minor in the quarter. Our second quarter SAG cost increased mainly due to compensation-related expense, including incentives that are tied to earnings expectations and the share price. Our incentive plans are designed to reward our people for good execution, and improved earnings, both of which we have experienced. We also made investments in people and processes to accelerate the benefits derived from our sales and operational initiatives. Our trailing 12-month SAG expense, as a percentage of revenues, declined this year and we will continue to focus on further leveraging our SAG costs. I'll briefly touch on our non-aggregates segments. Asphalt gross profit was $28 million, an increase of $2 million, as compared to the prior year. Shipments increased by 8% or 5% on a same-store basis, due to large projects in the Arizona market. While the year-over-year shipment growth was good, it was less than we expected due to the adverse effects of weather on California and Texas volumes. Asphalt pricing in the quarter rose by 8%. This was partially offset by liquid asphalt unit costs, which were 16% higher this quarter compared to second quarter last year. Our concrete gross profit was in line with Q2 last year, with higher prices offsetting reduced volumes. Turning now to the balance sheet, little has changed from first quarter, except that our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio declined to 2.4 times within our target range. The average maturity of our debt is 15 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 4.5%. Our leverage position and debt structure provide us with significant flexibility, as we continue to grow our business. On page 8 of the supplemental slides, you'll find information on our discretionary cash flow expectation for the full year, using the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance as the starting point. As a reminder, we define discretionary cash flow as EBITDA less working capital change, interest, taxes and operating and maintenance capital. On this basis, our discretionary cash flow for 2019 is projected to be $815 million. While there were no share repurchases and no M&A during the quarter, these remain important parts of our capital allocation priorities. For the full year, we reiterate our expectation of spending approximately $250 million on operating and maintenance CapEx and approximately $200 million on internal growth projects. And now, before I turn it back over to Tom, I'll take this opportunity to reaffirm our 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion. We try to be thoughtful when we gave our initial 2019 annual guidance in February. And we have performed consistent with those expectations through the first half of the year. We believe we are well positioned to continue this execution in the second half of the year. We are mindful, however, of the storm related challenges that can characterize the third quarter and, therefore, we remain comfortable with our initial guidance range, and with finishing the year in the middle of that range. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thanks, Suzanne. I'm very proud of how our people have performed so far this year. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women at Vulcan, especially our operations and sales teams, for taking care of our customers, holding each other to a high standard of operational excellence and delivering on our financial results as promised. Our financial performance is important. But safety is always our number one priority. Our safety culture is strong and our safety metrics are industry-leading. It is critically important and remains our number one priority to send our employees home safely every day. As we move forward, we will continue to capitalize on our outstanding geographic footprint, execute at the local level, take advantage of market opportunities and continue growing our Aggregates' unit margin. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Hill : Good morning, Stanley. Stanley Elliott : Hey, good morning. How are you all doing? Tom Hill : Good. Suzanne Wood : Good, thanks. Stanley Elliott : Congratulations on the quarter. Could you guys talk high level kind of what you're seeing regionally -- certainly nice quarter here particularly with the weather issues? Tom Hill : Stan, just from a high level, if you look at how each geographic area is performing, I'll start in the East. Mid-Atlantic states described the private demand slow and steady, public highway demand is very good. Importantly, we're seeing robust pricing in margin growth in the Mid-Atlantic states in 2019. Moving to the Southeast United States, the Southeast states are really strong in the vast majority of those markets. I think the private side, we see growth a little bit of a watch in a couple of areas, Nashville, Miami. Nashville is -- the private sides are growing, but it's just long in the tooth. Miami, we're seeing a little bit of shrinkage on the private side. The rest of the Southeast states very good private, healthy demand from highways. So good volume. We're seeing really good margin expansion in this area, driven by good pricing and also responsible operations, cost management. And remember this is -- we are by far the largest in the Southeastern United States, largest producer. An encouraging area, Illinois. This is a market it's actually -- we're starting to see it turn. We're now seeing pickup in private demand driven by airport and tollway work. We just saw Illinois pass the highway bill, which we're thrilled with. So, more demand coming on the public side. Non-res is growing. Res is now improving, prices are improving. This is really good news for Illinois, which has struggled for the last five or six years. It is also good news because this is a really well-run business, and with these volumes coming on, we're able to leverage that performance. Moving over to Texas, DFW/North Texas, very healthy public growth, slower on the private side, price and concerns on res and non-res, little bit slower pricing in North Texas. South Texas, we see public demand is actually really hot. The private side, I'd say a mixed bag, res okay. Non-res a little bit slower, but okay. Prices very healthy. Coastal Texas, this is a very strong market both on public and private, very good pricing and margin expansion in Coastal Texas. And we've not seen anything really substantial out of the energy sector. It will be exciting for 2021, 2022. Moving over to California. This is -- despite weather, exciting market for us. Solid public growth, particularly in Central and -- excuse me -- solid private growth, particularly in Central and Southern California. The Bay has gotten pricey on the private side. So maybe a watch for us there, but our focus there has been highways. Public side is growing and growing fast and accelerating. We've got big backlogs growing, highway lettings. Pricing in California has been very good, is very good. We see high single-digit this year. And we've seen very good cost control in spite of bad weather in California. So substantial margin growth, everybody is concerned about California. I -- particularly, I'm not. In fact, I'm really thrilled with our performance in spite of wet weather. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. And I'd just add one thing to that. I think in first quarter, you will remember us saying in terms of pricing that the pricing gains were very widespread across the country with all the markets. Our key markets up in pricing year-over-year save one, which was Illinois at the time and it was winter. So that wasn't of a particular concern to us. In the second quarter, Illinois has joined the rest of our key markets and each of those key markets had pricing that exceeded second quarter last year. So we thought that was a very positive sign as well. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. And then last from me, on the cost environment. Are you seeing anything in the second half of the year, be it labor, whatever it would be that would be pause for concern in terms of what's going to happen on the pricing environment? And then kind of as a corollary to that, you've done a nice job of putting a lot of growth CapEx and cost reduction at the quarry level and at the distribution level. Help us with that in terms of how we think about managing that cost structure going forward? Tom Hill : Yeah, I think you saw a very good performance in cost in the second quarter. Our total cost of sales was up 2% in spite of wet weather through a number of our states, which really eats up operating efficiencies. So we overcame that. The biggest driver of the increase is, you heard Suzanne say the second quarter was stripping in anticipation of sales volume growth. So I'll take that problem all the time. We saw good improvements on operating efficiencies and the things that drive our cost. Our folks are very focused on this, more to come. I can't tell you how focus our operators are on improving their operating efficiencies that really drive the cost. But based on our performance in Q2, they are winning. This is so important as you know, because it's a big driver of those unit margins and being able to take that incremental revenue to the bottom line. So as I would describe the rest of the year, more to come and I would expect us to keep improving our operating efficiencies. Stanley Elliott : Perfect, thank you very much. Congratulations and best of luck. Tom Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. Tom Hill : Good morning, Jerry. Suzanne Wood : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Hi, Tom, Suzanne, Mark, how are you? Tom Hill : Good. Jerry Revich : Good. Can you talk about the pricing cadence on the spot market heading into the back half of the year? Now that we have six months in the book, so I'm wondering if the high end of your initial pricing guidance is still achievable? Or if there are mixed factors we should keep in mind as well? Tom Hill : You know we talk a lot about price. I think that remember that most of the fixed -- fixed plant was priced in January and February. We did see some successes in mid-year price increases to fixed plants in a number of markets Virginia, Alabama, it goes to some of the Gulf Coast, Arizona. The other 60% of our work is bid work and we bidding in as we speak. We always tell you that's a -- that's not a spot market price increase, that's a campaign over time. And we feel good about what we see in our backlogs and our booking pace, we think those prices will move up through the balance of the year as we bid. And all of that's driven by confidence and visibility into a growing market particularly, the very visible and very fast growing public market and highways. So I think as you look at, as we step back and Suzanne look at our booking pace. And how our back pricing as that is going, and the pricing in our backlogs, we are very comfortable that the balances of the year price increases will be in line with guidance. Jerry Revich : And in terms of -- is it, is there any potential to get to the high end of the guidance? So to get to the high end, you'd have to put up pricing north of 8%. It sounds like we're probably gravitating toward the midpoint of the guidance which implies pricing closer to, call it 6.5% in the back half compared to that\u2026 Tom Hill : I'd say you -- I would say more toward the middle of the range of guidance. I think that's a realistic and very achievable goal. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then to shift gears for asphalt, in the past you folks have gotten that business to be in the mid-to-high teens from a gross margin standpoint. And I'm wondering, is there anything structurally different in this cycle compared to the past, because when we're looking at 8% gross margins in a business that has about 8% SG&A to sales. That's not a fantastic profit contribution even with a great flow through that you're getting in aggregates. So I'm wondering, is there something structurally different in asphalt mix this cycle versus the past? Or when can we get back to those teens type gross margins? Tom Hill : Well, I think the simple answer is no, there's nothing structural change in Asphalt. This is a function liquid pricing and cost. And I think you're seeing a turn there. Overall, we are seeing profitability in the Asphalt product line improving both in volume and unit profitability. You saw that in Q2 with volumes up 8%. And that was both volumes were up in spite of wet weather in Tennessee, Texas and California, where -- some of our biggest asphalt states. Liquid costs were up $11 million. However, gross profit per ton was flat. This stopped a six quarter run of shrinking unit margin in asphalt, due to liquids prices spiking. That levelled off as you remember -- fourth quarter to first quarter, and it's been pretty much flat through the first half. Looking ahead, I would expect unit margins to be on the rise as asphalt prices are rising and liquid prices has stabilized. If you step back and look at the full year, I would maybe expect us to end up a little on the lower end of guidance in asphalt. And that's really a function of wet weather in the first half of the year. We just had so much rain in Tennessee, Texas and California that we don't know that we'll have enough shipping days to get the volume, we expected before the end of the year. Now that being said, our backlogs are very good. Our lettings are growing and the unit margins are growing. So between rising unit margins, big backlogs, a dramatic increase in how we're funding and lettings in Vulcan states, this product line has a very bright future. Suzanne Wood : And I would add to that with respect to the guidance for the remainder of the year, Tom's right, you know we're just being a bit cautious in evaluating the number of shipping days we have left and the ability of our contractors to perform all of that work in a very compressed timeframe. If you go back to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for the non-aggregates segment, which is asphalt, as well as Concrete and Calcium, we said that we expected that to grow year-over-year the gross profit by 15% to 20%. We now think that that gross profit year-over-year growth will probably be toward the lower end of that, at about 15%. Again, being a little bit cautious on that. And I think that in terms of consensus, most of the consensus is at about 15% anyway. Jerry Revich : Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Schrier of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Hill : Good morning, Scott. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Scott Schrier : Hi, Good morning everyone. So last 12 months, you had 65% incremental margins. They are over your company norms and your target levels. It looks like you have good cost control, you have volumes to support the fixed cost absorption, pricing in the mid-single digit range, you've got you're stripping out of the way this quarter. Is it possible to maintain a 65% run rate given the compounding profitability characteristics of Aggregates? I'm not asking you to commit to it of course, taking into account all your comments on guidance, but I'm curious what would be needed? And is it possible to sustain an elevated level of profitability? Tom Hill : I think, we -- first of all, let me if I misspoke on stripping, I didn't mean to -- the stripping is not out of the way. That will continue through the year because of demand and what we see coming with particularly with the highway demand. So stripping costs will stay up for a while, and I would expect them to stay up, I know they stay up between for at least the next six months. Again, that's a good thing because it's anticipating big volume growth driven by public demand. I think, we hate sound like a broken record, but we're going to take you always back to 60, not the good things can't lineup in a row for a while to get you above 60. But we point out well you have a lot of tailwinds. This is -- this sport is played outside, there is a lot of things that can happen and to offset just the tailwinds. You're not going to have them, you're going to get -- you're going to get some things that are going to challenge you along with the good stuff. So just from experience, can you have a period at above 60? Yes. Can you have a period of below 60? Yes. But I think, we'd always bring you back to 60. Scott Schrier : Got it. Understood. And then I wanted to ask another one on the cost side of things and your cost containment. And I'm curious, if you could speak to some of the efficiencies of profitability you're seeing in some of the long-haul markets, either through your vessels and container road or the rail networks and also a little more on that, we've been hearing about some moderation in transportation costs. And I'm wondering if there's some puts and takes there. One of the things that we've heard or you have spoken about in the past is higher transportation cost generally enhance the economic moat of the Aggregates business, but is there the potential that moderating costs could actually potentially open up some more competition in pressure pricing? Thank you. Tom Hill : I think first of all, the cost I'm referring to is our actual operating costs, not transportation. It's actually the cost to produce and sell rock taking the logistics -- taking most logistics out of that. So I'm really referring to our total cost of sales to produce stone, ex-transportation. Going to your transportation question, we are seeing rising costs for long-haul transportation, particularly by rail. As you know, this is a spike, but it's real this year. The Mississippi River and the river transportation costs have been delayed and higher due to flooding. So, I would tell you that particularly long-haul transportation, we continue to see it escalate not go down, no level it is actually going up at a pretty good path. Scott Schrier : Got it. Great, thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Hill : Good morning, Kathryn. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Kathryn Thompson : Hi, thanks -- thank you for taking my questions today. On press release, more on the policy related with Illinois and also following up on SB-1 and Prop 7. But with Illinois, could you give -- just given the increased funding, give more color in terms of what end markets you primarily serve in Illinois today? And what has it looked back historically, when there was actual funding for infrastructure? And shifting for SB-1 and Prop 7, are you seeing the full impact of those two initiatives? Or do you believe that funding and lettings will continue to grow? Thank you. Tom Hill : Illinois, we really service the full market and it's -- we're not focused on the private, particularly the private or the public, and we service non-res, res, public and highways. It's nice to see Illinois turn the -- that how we work -- that how the funding will take a while to flow through as it does in every state. However, particularly in Illinois, we think we'll get bridged because there is substantial tollway and airport funding, which is very close to one of our largest quarries up there. But Illinois doubled their gas tax from $0.19 to $0.38, it is firewalled. It will take -- that will actually double the capital expenditures in Illinois for highways over ship -- now over a six-year time frame. And as I said, we're starting to see res and non-res turn. I think we're slowing the res, this is a very well managed business for us. So as I said earlier, this is exciting, because we are improving unit margins regardless of -- we've been improving unit margins in Illinois despite challenges for volume. This volume growth will really put some, put the turbos to that and so we'll enjoy that. As far as highways, excuse me, highway spending is concerned, across the country. We're excited about it and I'll run through eight or nine of those if you allow me. Florida highway lettings in 2020 will be up 25%. Georgia highway lettings will double in fiscal year 2020. We expect highway lettings in Texas to be up 25%. VDOT and regional authorities should be up 20%, South Carolina up 10%, Tennessee revenues have doubled -- excuse me, have gone up 40% since the Improve Act passed. California is very exciting. We've seen since SB1 through fiscal year, 2017-2018, we have seen lettings double. They will be up another $1 billion in fiscal year 2020, which just started. So to your point, highway lettings are very good and dramatically improving over the next 12 months. Kathryn Thompson : Okay, very helpful. And then shifting to the residential end market. Where are you seeing areas of strength, weakness and what's the cadence of growth you're seeing on your -- for your major markets? Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Starting in the west, res in California is good a watch for us would be San Francisco, which has it's gotten pricey. Moving to Arizona, res is quite strong, non-res and res due to the private side in Texas, probably a watch in DFW, where Houston is strong. The Southeast, the private market is quite good across the vast majority of our markets. In the Southeast, the watch for us would be residential and Nashville, which is -- our shipments are growing in residential, we're really watching it because it has been there a long time and it's been very high, long time. Miami a little bit different story, probably some contraction in the private side in Miami. In the Mid-Atlantic, I would describe the private side as steady slow growth. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. Kathryn, and I would just add to that again, looking at our geography, our footprint in the markets we serve, I mean the fundamentals continue to be in place you've heard us mention those a number of times. Good population growth, good employment growth with respect to res, still relatively speaking, a low level of houses. I mean, we are certainly not back anywhere close to peak starts and then with the interest rate environment and the fed signaling that it is -- while things can always change, I mean it's relatively unlikely that we're going to have a rate rise in the next little bit. I mean those are fundamentals we watch all the time that are generally moving in a positive direction. Kathryn Thompson : Thank you very much. Operator : We will now take our next question from Rohit Seth of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Suzanne Wood : Hey, Rohit. Rohit Seth : Hey, how you doing? Tom Hill : Good. Rohit Seth : My question on the energy projects. You touched on that a little bit in the prepared remarks, but can you just talk a little bit about the opportunity set and what you are seeing there? Tom Hill : Yeah. We are following about a dozen projects that are multi-year, multi-million ton projects that are at different stages in the pipeline. And all are in different stages. Most, the vast majority of this work will ship between 2020 and 2023. So we're not there yet. There is a little bit shipping around the fringes, a few of those. So, we're trying to help those folks, get numbers and get those projects ready and get them started. Remember that, with our Bluewater capacity, it gives us an edge here with these projects. They will be exciting. We are working on them. But they would -- I would expect them to start impacting us until sometime mid-year 2020. Rohit Seth : Okay. And then I just wanted to talk about your backlog. You guys just put a slide together in your deck, showed the highway backlog. Would you characterize that as moving up, down or kind of stable? Tom Hill : I would describe highway work dramatically moving up, and that will continue to escalate over the next five to seven years. Rohit Seth : Okay. Thank you. That's all I got. Tom Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Hill : Good morning, Trey. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Trey Grooms : Hey. Good morning, everyone. First should be on, just I guess some housekeeping here on the mix benefit that you guys realized in the quarter on price. Was that more of a product related mix benefit or was there a geographic benefit there? And then any expected mix impacted in the third quarter? Suzanne Wood : Yeah. The 50 basis points was geographic mix. Trey Grooms : Okay. Tom Hill : As far as the second half mix, I wouldn't expect, there always be some kind of mix with geography and a little bit of product, but I wouldn't expect it to be dramatic in the second half of the year. Trey Grooms : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. And then, you also -- you mentioned the stripping costs, and of course that can happen from one quarter to the next. And I think you said that it's going to be ongoing, and then also with freight costs, you said it's still going up for you guys on the longer haul stuff. But as we look at the increase in COGS that we saw in the quarter, I think it was the 2%, is that a similar kind of rate that we should be thinking about as we look in the back half when we're looking at these costs? Tom Hill : I would tell you that the short answer to your question is yes. I think that our folks are doing a good job, as I said earlier, executing on those operating disciplines that drive cost and the efficiency with that. I think it's important this that you take that cost and take it to unit margins. We saw unit margins in the second quarter up 11% to $5.34. We've now put together three quarters in a row with double-digit unit margin improvement, and that is a combination of solid pricing, but very good operating execution. And it's not about spending money. It's really about the execution of the operating disciplines that drive costs. So, you heard me thank our folks, the men and women at Vulcan that drive those unit margins, I'd like to do that again, because they are now consistently turning in double-digit improvements in gross profit per ton. So, I would expect us to continue our operating disciplines and the cost to follow. Trey Grooms : Yeah. I know that operating execution has really been a focus for you guys. Congrats on the good results there. Last one for me is just on you -- of course, the Illinois market you mentioned in Texas and Tennessee saw delays, but to Suzanne point earlier on. I think we were talking about ready-mix. But there is only so many hours in a day and so many days in a quarter and in a year. So, as we're kind of looking at these -- the delays that we saw in some of these markets for you guys, I know the underlying demand is there, that's pretty clear. But, how do we think about the opportunity to kind of execute or realize on some of this may be pent-up demand that might be there? Tom Hill : Yeah. So, I think you're right. You're exactly right. There is only half the year left or less than half the year left now. We also have some bottlenecks for transportation. I think the underlying demand is there, that demand is not going away. So whatever we don't ship in 2019, we will ship in 2020 that you saw the perfect example to that is in January of this year when that work would be pin-up and shipped in January. So, it will really be a function to some degree of weather and timing on some large projects. I think -- if you don't mind, I'll stop and step back and kind of let you know how we look at the second half of the year. As you heard Suzanne say, we are very comfortable with our guidance. I think we tried to be thoughtful when we gave you guidance in February. We said the upper end would be good weather and jobs starting on time. The lower end would be increment weather and jobs delayed. As you look at us giving guidance -- staying in that guidance range for the balance of the year, what we want to do is be prudent about weather and timing on jobs. We had a really good start to the year with January extremely strong with that flow through of work from 2018 pushing back. The rest of the year shipments, the other five months has actually been at the high end of our guidance, next January. But now we need to remember that the third quarter is our most volatile quarter. It is the peak of the construction season, at the same time; it is also the heart of the storm season. We've all experienced one storm and luckily didn't flip us too bad. So, we're just trying to be realistic and transparent about storm threats in the middle of peak of construction season. If you move to pricing, our pricing has consistently through the year been in line with guidance. We expect that to continue for the rest of the year, and our look at that is solid I believe in our guidance. As we talk about our operating disciplines, we have executed well and created cost savings. All of that has driven double-digit unit margin growth for the first half of the year. We would expect that to continue for the balance of the year. So, I would think we'd be on the high side of Aggregates' volume guidance. Moving to Asphalt, Asphalt work was -- as we talked about was delayed in the first half because of rain in Tennessee, California, Texas, those are three of our biggest Asphalt states. So, in spite of very big backlogs and growing lettings and growing unit margins, some of that work may get pushed back just because of what we talked about the number of times. As Suzanne mentioned, a bit extra cost in incentives and investment in unit margin on SAG. So, I would expect the year to play out this way. A bit stronger on Aggregates' earnings, a bit lower on Asphalt earnings. You put all that together, I would tell you that Suzanne and I are confident in the year in the middle of our guidance range. Trey Grooms : Thanks a lot. Tom Hill : You bet. Operator : We will now take our next question from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Garik Shmois : Hi, thanks. And thanks for all the detail on the guidance, Sue. You kind of answered a lot of my questions there. But I wanted to ask your backlogs are very strong, you've got a stronger outlook across your geographies and I know we're not talking formerly about 2020. But if you look out over the next 12 to 18 months, what would be the limiting factor outside of say weather to drive volume growth as you see here -- it just sounds like your visibility has gotten better. So, is there certain capacity constraints in the market that would limit your ability to continue to grow it, call it this low to mid-single-digit volume clip or anything else out there that it could be I guess inhibiting factor for you? Tom Hill : I don't think I see inhibiting factors that would limit mid-single -- low to mid-single volume growth. I think that's achievable. I think when you get above that, it gets tougher because of things like transportation and labor for our customers, not for us but for our customers. You also are seeing maturity on a lot of highway dollars and mixed in that are bigger and bigger more complex jobs, the timing of which it can be all over the place. We've had a few jobs delayed even this year with some big highway work and still we're shipping well within our -- excuse me, the top end of our range of guidance. So, to answer your question, I don't see it for the numbers that you say. Now, if you want to get to high single-digit, yeah, you start to get compressed with labor and transportation and just our customers' capacity. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks. And I just wanted to ask just on G&A just given the bump due to the performance compensation in the quarter, how should we think about G&A costs through the balance of the year? Suzanne Wood : Yeah, it's a good question. The -- we had initially guided back at the start of the year to around $355-ish million. We now expect that number to be somewhere between $360 million, $365 million. Obviously, we will continue to look for ways to leverage that. But year-over-year that will put us put our SG&A, expenses or our SAG expenses. I should say, as a percentage of revenues, basically in line with where they were last year, maybe just a tick below. And I -- it's important that we made some of the investments we did because again, we are on a very serious course here to improve our unit margins. We have a number of operational initiatives under way. And so, I think making investments there to help further those initiatives and hopefully deliver results a bit quicker are good investments to make. So yeah, hopefully that updated guide is helpful. I think the consensus on SAG expenses for the full year is about $360 million. So, pretty much in line with that. Garik Shmois : Okay, thanks. I just wanted to ask just one more question. Just on pricing, are you seeing any markets, I know you don't, like before, we talked about mid-year price increases because you're continuously evaluating pricing, on a job-by-job basis. But are there any markets that are structurally, just given the demand strength coming in maybe toward the higher end of your guidance, that are tighter on supply and in turn fundamentally seeing more attractive supply demand environment in terms of potentially better pricing environment? Thomas Hill : I think there is, few markets where certain sizes are tight. And there is pricing opportunity. But I think the big driver on pricing is the visibility on demand is coming. And the people's confidence that they have worked and they can take risk on to form pricing and profitability. And I think that's pretty broad spread and it's followed -- a lot of it's followed the increases in state and local funding, as we talked about in all the states that drive the vast majority of our revenues. So, while that's out there, I think the big driver is more fundamental and more ingrained, which is a good thing. Because it means it's more long-term. Garik Shmois : Great, thanks for the help. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Phil Ng : Hi. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Phil Ng : Good morning. Nice to see the acceleration in pricing this year in Aggregates, backlogs are quite strong, and pushing you some bottlenecks on the shipment side. Is this level of momentum on growth on pricing sustainable for the next few years? Thomas Hill : Short answer is I think the answer is yes. Phil Ng : Okay. Thomas Hill : And the reason I have confidence in that is because of the long-term growth substantially growing funding. And on the public side and highways and how visible that is and how sure that is. And so you put those, that you picked that -- there is growing, that is very visible and that is shared and protected. Gives people confidence throughout the construction sector that they can take risk on price. Phil Ng : Got it and just on that note, appreciating that most of the highway funding has been driven more at the state level, but with funding for the Highway Trust Fund expected to wind down next year. What are some of the milepost that you are looking at, from a timing perspective before you think, if nothing gets done. You could see some of these projects push out or stall a little bit? Thomas Hill : Well, first of all, I don't see the demand stalling because of the -- how the Federal funding. If you take, let's step back and look at Federal funding, first and then we'll go into total highway demand. The House and the Senate are working on a highway bill. Our policymakers and key committees are working on the reauthorization package now. Phil Ng : Yeah. Thomas Hill : Recently, the Senate Environmental Public Works Committee is right now working on a bill, which would increase funding by 28%. We'll see what happens with that. And funding is a big part of the ongoing conversation. But that being said about the highway bill reauthorization, you got to remember two really important facts when it comes down to highway demand. Number one, Feds are not going to let highway funding go down even if the FAST Act expires. They'll just \u2013 they'll make extensions and keep the funding there regardless. Number two, our states are extremely well \u2013 our states and local governments are extremely well funded. So funding in Vulcan states is up 60%, that's an increase of over $20 billion per year in 11 states. Now remember, put that in perspective, that's $20 billion in 11 states versus a Federal bill, which is $45 billion over 50 states. And that funding is really starting to flow through those \u2013 we're starting to ship one, and you are seeing the lettings grow. So highway demand will grow, absolutely grow over the next five to seven years. Phil Ng : Got it. Suzanne Wood : And I would just also add to that \u2013 that historically, at times in the past, when it was time for a Federal bill to be renewed, states have operated in this Federal bill extension mode. So, they understand how to do that and are comfortable with doing that, and I think the other point I would make is that, if you divide the highway spending among Federal, state and local levels, it's about a third, a third, a third. So that's why we keep talking a lot about this state funding and local funding and the importance of it, because that represents about two-thirds of the spending. Phil Ng : Got it. That's really helpful color guys. And just one last one for me, question for you, Suzanne. Based on the outlook for next few years from a growth standpoint -- definitely sounds strong, directionally, how should we think about CapEx and capital deployment priorities? There was obviously a few big deals in the market a few years ago, but just curious how you thinking about M&A, the pipeline and just directionally, the sizing of some of these potential target? Suzanne Wood : Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you looked at the M&A, we've typically done in the past. It's been more of the bolt-on variety as opposed to big M&A. I mean loyalty \u2013 deals come and go in the market. We take a look at the deals when they arise, because that's just good practice to do that. But we have been very disciplined with our approach to M&A, and we would continue to be so. We have pretty big hurdle rates that the deals have to get over. They have to be very strategic to us. They have to be accretive to our return on investment profile. They have to be something that significantly extends the value of the franchise, and they have to be something \u2013 they have to be deals that we can integrate quickly and efficient at least so we are able to derive the synergies from them. So we continue to look, but again, we are disciplined, we would wait for the right thing. And we're not going to \u2013 we're not going to be crazy about multiples that is \u2013 that is not helpful in any event. If we think about other uses of that capital from a growth perspective, I mean, remember we're going to be spending about $200 million this year on growth CapEx, our internal growth projects, we're really excited about those. It is a way to enhance and generate EBITDA without a lot of risk and without paying some blue sky goodwill that you might have to pay, if you were to do a bit of M&A. And just as a reminder, some of those growth projects that we are working on this year and which are embedded in that $200 million projected spend are some Greenfield quarries that are in geographic areas that are beneficial to us, California, Texas, South Carolina, and in addition to that and personally, I'm very excited about this part. We also have a number of sales yards strategically located in the U.S. that when they come online would extend our franchise and our ability to reach customers. So M&A is one pathway, but for me, low risk EBITDA enhancing, extend the value of the franchise I quite like some of these internal growth projects. And again, we put those through a pretty strenuous return on investment review and they are accretive as well. Phil Ng : Got it. Thank you for the color. Suzanne Wood : Sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Wood of Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Hill : Good morning, Mike. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Michael Wood : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hi. I wanted to ask your markets in cement are impacted at all by the merger of the two large state owned [Technical Difficulty] in China and does that had a positive or negative impact on pricing in concrete? Tom Hill : I wouldn't see it affecting our markets in concrete positive or negative, I don't see a lot of impact for that. Now that being said, we\u2026 Michael Wood : Okay. And\u2026 Tom Hill : Go ahead. I'm sorry. Michael Wood : And then I'm curious, since you improved that segment as well in 2Q versus 1Q, but you saw lower gross profit year-over-year. So just if you can also talk about your confidence in the back half and how you're seeing pricing the end market? Tom Hill : Yeah. The -- actually our volumes is what we were -- gross profit was actually slightly down 2%, and that was really driven by volumes being down. Some of that was rain in Texas, some of that was timing of work in Virginia. Our prices were actually up 5% and unit margins were up 5%. So assuming we can get our projects going and get a little sunshine I think we will be fine for the rest of year in concrete. Michael Wood : And on Aggregates, can you give us some [Technical Difficulty] the weather impact in the lost shipping days in the quarter? Tom Hill : Yeah, I mean that's a dramatically -- that's a big mixed bag. We're in the quarter, I'll give you a few examples in big markets where we got hurt. Dallas had another 15 days of rain, San Antonio had an increase of 24 days of rain, Houston had an increase of six days, in California we saw, LA of five days, San Francisco of nine days. So I guess that kind of gives you a feel for what that was like, and Knoxville was up dramatically, but I don't remember exactly the number of days in Knoxville. So, and then if you look at Illinois, we lost a full month, we lost 22 days in Chicago. Suzanne Wood : And if you go back and look at the shipment volume guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year, which was 3% to 5%, you'll remember we talked about what would put us at the top end of the range and what would put us at the lower end of the range the 3%. And the two things we called out that would put us there would have been delay of some big projects that's sometimes just unavoidable, it's outside the control and also weather. And so given the fact that Q2 was wet and as Tom just described, I mean, we were frankly, we were pleased to have our volume growth come out at 4% in the quarter because don't forget California and Texas two of the markets we've called out as being quite wet as have others. Those two markets comprise about 30% give or take of our volume. So we were pretty pleased. Michael Wood : Okay. Thanks for all the color. Tom Hill : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Hill : Good morning, Mike. Suzanne Wood : Good Morning. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom Hill : Sure. Mike Dahl : Suzanne, I wanted to pick up on that last that last comment, and if you think about the performance in the quarter, despite some of the headwinds, it doesn't actually seem like that much of a heavy lift to get -- you're not just at the top end of the volume guide, but maybe a bit above the volume guide for the year and Tom I know you made the comment that maybe it's high-end of that and then so the 5% range, but has just more specifically thinking about what you've seen quarter-to-date, is there anything you'd point out as far as volume cadence? And kind of what to expect for magnitude of growth in 3Q versus 4Q? Tom Hill : Yeah, I think, let's just concentrate on the third quarter and really for the balance of the year, but I think what you heard me say was, we're trying to be prudent, going into the third quarter and the underscore there is the third quarter is the peak of the construction season, but it's also the peak of the storm season. So that can go really, really well or that can go really, really tough or it can be a mixed bag. And so I think us telling you the high end of our guidance is trying to take some of that into for volume is trying to take some of that into account. The perfect example to that is what we saw in the first half in California. And so it's really trying to be thoughtful and trying to give you our best educated expectation of what we expect based on history and based on our backlogs and based on what we see is a booking pace. Suzanne Wood : That's right. And I would, I would just add to this, I've got the numbers here for the second half last year in -- I have the third quarter as well. But let's not forget, last year in the third and fourth quarter, those who were not -- I don't really consider them to be terribly easy comparisons. If you look at the second half last year, our volume grew 9%, our gross profit per ton grew 11%, and for the two quarters combined, our flow-through was about 63%. That's a pretty good performance that we would be talking about over-achieving here. Price was at 2%, perhaps there is some upside there, but it was a pretty strong volume and gross profit per ton second half. Mike Dahl : Great. I appreciate that. But I guess it's good to hear that that upper end it sounds like it actually does and you corporate the -- some conservatism around the weather, which is great. The second question I had is bigger picture, you kind of alluded to a few different time some of the internal initiatives and now some of these are earlier stage than others, but can you give us a flavor on some of the internal initiatives that you're using to drive unit margins over the next couple of years? Where are we at on some of the big initiatives? And can you quantify any goal posts for us to be thinking about in terms of impact? Tom Hill : From a very high level, what drives our quality earnings is what drives gross profit per ton. Again, at a high level, that would include four areas of focus, commercial excellence, our logistics efficiencies, number three how we procure our goods and services and the fourth, our operating disciplines and the disciplines around those efficiencies that drive cost. Now we've been working on these at different stages over the last few years. We've invested in people and processes and systems to improve our metrics in our disciplines. And what you're seeing is results, improvements in our gross profit per ton. Again, bragged on our people in this earlier, we've put together now three quarters where we've had double-digit improvement unit margins, so solid work. But as you pointed out, we are far from being done, we got a long ways to go. And when you start talking about goalposts, this -- you got to remember this is an ultra-local business, and every one of our markets and submarkets has their goalposts. But putting those together is not as nearly as important as what happens on that local level. So this is exciting. We've done a lot of hard work. We got a lot more hard work to do. So but I congratulate our folks for being disciplined and being diligent with this, but more to come on these efforts. Mike Dahl : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Sure. Operator : We will take our final question from Robert Muir of Berenberg Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Hill : Good morning, Robert. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Daniel Wang : Hi, this is actually Dan on for Rob. Tom Hill : Oh, great. Daniel Wang : Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick question with regards to the split between the three end markets. Is there any way to quantify the performance of like infrastructure res and non-res. In particular, I remember last quarter around the Southeast non-res was particularly strong. I was just wondering whether that has continued and what you've seen across your geographic footprint? Thanks. Tom Hill : I think that we would describe the private side in most of our market is growing and steady growth. A few places a little harder than others. The public side is growing and growing faster and will continue to grow faster. I would call the public side absolutely across our footprint we see growth. Again, as Suzanne said, the fundamentals for the private side, which are population growth, employment growth, very low inventories of houses and now we expect lowering interest rates. That is a good formula for private demand growth. Put that with the dramatically growing funding from highways and that maturing into lettings and now into shipments that is a great formula for public demand growth. So I would call it solid and exciting, and I will call it solid and exciting across our footprint. Daniel Wang : Okay. Thank you very much. Tom Hill : Thank you. Well, thank you for joining us today. We really appreciate your interest in Vulcan and your time this morning. And we look forward to discussing the Company and our results and our performance throughout the quarter. Look forward to seeing you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill. Bill Sandbrook : Thank you, John. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our call. In light of continued strength in each of our markets and improved weather patterns, I am pleased to announce that our quarterly revenue hit a record high of $409 million. The growth in revenue was driven by higher ready-mixed volumes and increased average sales prices in our aggregates and ready-mixed product lines. Our total adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $62 million a record high as well and our adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 15.2% with the increased volumes contributing to these improvements. With our overall volume and revenue growth are a bit lower than we anticipated, we did, however, see meaningful volume growth in our Texas markets. Our volume growth was tempered somewhat by labor shortages in Texas, the softness in the residential housing markets in Northern California and a continued erosion of the New York City union ready-mixed markets by nonunion competitors. The continued economic expansion and the overall growth of the North Texas markets, has limited the availability of commercial truck drivers. We continue to aggressively recruit drivers but the strengthening economy, the low unemployment rate and the numerous alternate employment opportunities makes the job of recruitment and retention more difficult than it has been in the past, limiting our ability to fully utilize our fleet and capture additional incremental market share. While the driver shortage presents its challenges, it does speak to the continued strength of the underlying demand environment in our North Texas markets. We are aggressively pursuing non-traditional avenues to source and retain drivers in these markets and fully expect to overcome these challenges going into the new year. Our volumes in Northern California market are being impacted by a temporary slowdown in the residential housing markets. While there is an increase in housing in the Central and Sacramento Valley areas, where we do not participate, the exact opposite is the case for our markets in the Bay Area. However, both at the state and local government levels and within the tech industry itself, the critical shortage of available affordable housing is recognized as being aggressively addressed through creative changes in permitting, zoning and financing alternatives. Additionally, while funding for new infrastructure projects under SB-1 is being released some of the larger projects such as Highway 99 and Interstate five in the Central Valley are outside of our service area. Furthermore, in certain California regions, the release of funds seems to be taking a bit longer than initially expected and these funding delays were not anticipated earlier in the year. However, the Silicon Valley tech industry and the commercial sector remained vibrant with many new projects on the horizon in 2020. In New York, the competitive dynamic continues to migrate towards the nonunion markets. The migration of work is not overly concerning as we participate in both the union and nonunion markets. But the management of the workforce between the two presents its challenges and we are confident that we have the correct operating model going into 2020. As for pricing, we experienced some negative mix effects from a higher percentage of our ready-mixed business, shifting to the Dallas metro markets from our Northern California markets, due to the factors previously discussed. As we have described on previous calls, our pricing in Dallas is materially lower than San Francisco because of structural cost differences. Do not let mix and its effect on average selling price mask the true strength of underlying regional real price increases. Turning to our aggregate results, while we did experience a slight decline in aggregate volumes during the quarter, the decline was driven primarily by the logistics associated with our Polaris aggregates supply chain and a temporary lull in the Bay Area residential markets. Some of our shipments were deferred into the fourth quarter as one of the shifts in the rotation experienced propeller issue causing it to be temporarily taken out of service. However, the lost volume in the quarter did not limit the team's ability to improve efficiency and profitability. Aggregate volumes in our Central and Atlantic regions were up versus the prior year period due to continued steady demand in those regions. The flooding on the Red River has subsided and production is returning to more normal levels in that location as well. Significant operational improvements in both our Texas and New Jersey aggregate operations were evident in our improved margins in the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Ronnie to take us through each of our markets and to highlight our margin improvement progress. Ronnie Pruitt : Thanks, Bill, and good morning everyone. As I mentioned on our previous calls, we have undertaken several strategic initiatives to improve margins across all areas of our company. These initiatives include delivery, mix, process, and customer optimization. The continued development of our proprietary dispatching system WheresMyConcrete, along with the embedded CRM system will play a critical role in the success of these initiatives. To that end I recently traveled throughout our regions hosting a series of town hall meetings with numerous members of our U.S. Concrete team. During these meetings we discussed our C3 discipline of courage, compassion and credibility within our workforce, while also reinforcing our process improvement initiatives throughout the regions. The overwhelming positive response from our team members not only embracing but owning these goals is extremely encouraging. We have a tremendous amount of work ahead but I am confident in our margin improvement initiatives. As I mentioned before our digital transformation strategy will be a critical piece of our successful path. As such, we are continuing to increase our investment from the technology with the objective of improving the customer experience, while at the same time increasing revenue and reducing costs. Our digital platform WheresMyConcrete will be the cornerstone of the digital transformation initiative with the continued development of its core quote-to-cash functionality, mobile applications, analytics and artificial intelligence. Feedback from our early adopters of WheresMyConcrete confirms the substantial benefits to our regional teams and customer based on enhanced transparency and improved data analytics, which is leading to more informed and quicker decision-making. Beyond the targeted value proposition that WheresMyConcrete delivers to our business, our technology team is identifying even more ways to leverage this technology to further enhance the customer experience along with our delivery efficiencies. Now let me spend some time on our regional performance. Our Central region, which includes Texas, Oklahoma and the USVI operations, represented 37% of our revenue this quarter. This region continues to show strong demand as we see the North Dallas area attract new corporate office relocations leading to added jobs and population growth. One of the more exciting additions to the corporate landscape is Uber bringing 3,000 jobs and its plan to spend more than $75 million in capital outside of downtown Dallas. Microsoft is also expanding its reach in the North Texas market by moving more of its operations to Irving, while investing over $31 million in capital. These investments will further enhance Dallas' position as a technology hub, which should drive further investment from this sector in the future. We are also continuing to see vertical construction outside of the traditional downtown Dallas setting. The West Plano area, a major area of recent job growth is getting its tallest tower yet. Plans for a 415,000-square foot mixed-use development that will top out at 18 storeys is set to begin construction in early 2020. The continued future growth in the North Dallas market will be supported by the record lettings expected and the many non-DOT projects planned. Recently, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and American Airlines announced plans to invest $3.5 billion to develop a sixth terminal. A significant non-DOT project that is showing major potential, passing many hurdles to get towards construction is the $16 billion high-speed rail project that will connect Dallas to Houston, which will utilize nearly 10 million cubic yards of concrete. Just to put that in perspective, that's nearly three times as much as we used to -- or as we used to construct the Hoover Dam. Strengthening our position in this market, we continue to focus on vertical integration opportunities. We recently began commissioning on one of our previously mentioned greenfield aggregate plants, MW Ranch, located south of the DFW Metroplex. This operation will serve both internal needs as well as grow our external customer base in this high-growth area of the metroplex. We anticipate this plant being fully operational by the end of this year. We are also progressing with the modernization of our Amarillo aggregate operation. This new production facility should be fully operational in the first half of 2020 and add much-needed production capacity as well as lower production costs, supporting our downstream assets in this high-growth West Texas market. Our West region which includes Northern California ready-mixed operations and Polaris aggregates represented approximately 30% of our revenue this quarter. This market is seeing strong results in commercial construction driven by the tech sector and public programs. We are confident that infrastructure spend will continue to support this sector as funding from California's SB-1 legislation continues to be more widely rolled out. This is an important step for safety of all the constituents of California and further supports both our aggregate and ready-mixed concrete operations. More specifically, Polaris will benefit from increased aggregate demand in both Northern and Southern California, as ready-mixed demand increases from these public projects. While we have seen some softness in the residential housing markets that we serve, we feel confident that the spend for commercial, industrial and infrastructure projects should mitigate this softness. In fact, Facebook recently announced they're committing $1 billion towards better land utilization for housing middle-income workers and more appropriate housing to help solve many other into these needs. Apple has committed $2.5 billion towards affordable housing in California, while Google has also committed $1 billion for housing development. The East region, which includes New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and D.C. Virginia, represented 33% of our revenue this quarter. We have a high degree of optimism in this regional market and are seeing the benefits from strategic changes we made to our sales structure earlier this year, specifically greater alignment with our customers and markets. In the New York region, we are experiencing a more competitive landscape of nonunion contractors, gaining opportunities from union projects. With the shift in work to the outer boroughs, our footprint gives us a distinct advantage that allows us to competitively pursue work, while controlling delivery costs. This can be seen in our high-profile work that we have across all boroughs that will continue to drive volumes well into next year. We're also aggressively focused on driver recruitment, training -- and training to help us overcome delivery issues and further reduce delivery and personnel costs. New York is also taking infrastructure very seriously. Like many of our other markets they are doing what is necessary to handle the specific needs to support the safety and sustainability of their community. The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority recently approved a $51.5 billion capital plan to overhaul the city's transportation system. Plans for the BIG U, the $1 billion wall and park around the southern tip of Manhattan, seems to be moving forward with funds awarded and the September flooding providing a stark reminder of the need. Staten Island is also planning to build a protective wall to defend against the possibility of storm surges and reduce the impact of flood-related damages. With regards to aggregates, we are in the process of enhancing the output of both of our Northern New Jersey aggregate operations. Through both increased reserves as well as additional processing equipment, we anticipate better efficiencies and increased production throughout the next calendar year. We have also continued to enhance our sand operations in South Jersey which we transport by water into the New York market. We anticipate these enhancements to continue to provide more efficient operating costs as well as additional long-term capacity improvements. In our Washington D.C. market, we continue to see growth spurred by Amazon's HQ2, a 19-storey mixed-use tower was approved to be built in Pentagon City. Recent news is also out about one of Amazon's subsidiaries; Perspecta expanding Amazon's data center portfolio with a new facility in Northern Virginia. This adds to what is expected to be an economic boom for the Northern Virginia area from the data center market. Each of our markets presents their own positive outlook for continued building and growth reaffirming confidence in our construction markets. Now I would like to turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results. John Kunz : Thanks Ronnie. For the third quarter our total revenue of $409 million and adjusted EBITDA of $62 million both of which were all-time company records were driven by higher ready-mixed volumes which resulted from more favorable weather conditions and an active construction economy. Our material spread was $65.94 on a dollar per cubic yard basis. Our EBITDA adjustments for the quarter relate primarily to stock compensation acquisition-related costs and officer transition expenses. SG&A was 7.8% of revenue for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 8% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted SG&A excluding stock compensation acquisition-related costs and officer transition expenses was 6.3% of revenue in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 6.6% in the prior year quarter primarily reflecting the impact of higher revenue. As we discussed previously stock compensation expense was higher as our annual awards were made at the beginning of March, but the valuation for accounting purposes did not take place until shareholder approval at our annual meeting in May. In 2019 we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year and our interest expense is expected to be around $46 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate of 27% is based on the expectation that language unfavorable to manufacturers related to the interest deduction limitation currently included in the proposed regulation is removed by the Treasury in the final version. As of September 30, our total debt including current maturities was $706 million and we reported $72 million in operating lease liabilities. As of September 30 we had total liquidity of $263 million including $27 million of cash and cash equivalents and $236 million of availability under our revolver. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.7 times. With our anticipated improvement in volumes and performance in the fourth quarter versus the year ago quarter, we would expect to see a further reduction in this ratio at year-end. We continue to have a solid liquidity position and no near-term maturities associated with our senior notes or ABL facility. Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet, during the third quarter of 2019 we generated $51.5 million of cash provided by our operating activity as compared to $42.3 million in the prior year quarter. We generated $41.5 million of adjusted free cash flow compared to $45.5 million in the prior year quarter remembering that last year's cash flow included $15 million from the sale of our Dallas line of business. We will continue to focus on managing working capital and capital expenditures in the coming quarter to generate increased cash flow. We made contingent consideration payments associated with past acquisitions of approximately $23 million during the third quarter of 2019 and expect that any further contingent consideration payments in Q4 would not be significant  During the third quarter of 2019 we spent approximately $10.5 million on capital expenditures primarily related to our plants and machinery and equipment to support the continued demand in our markets compared to approximately $11.4 million for the same period last year. For the full year of 2019 we continue to anticipate managing capital expenditures in the range of $30 million to $35 million and anticipate that our equipment acquired through capital leases will be in the $20 million to $25 million range excluding capital for the development of a Texas aggregates quarry. Our cash flow from operating activities is expected to be in the range of 50% to 60% of adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see a robust demand environment as we look to build upon our third quarter results. We anticipate to continue -- continued solid cash flow generation along with sufficient liquidity to support our ongoing operational need. I'll now turn the call back over to Bill. Bill Sandbrook : Thanks, John. As we look into the fourth quarter and into 2020, our customers are telling us to expect the continuation of the type of activity that we have seen in the past few years. There continues to be a solid pipeline of projects coming to market with meaningful volumes and solid margin potential. Visibility for 2020 is becoming clear as we near the end of the year and our customers remain positive on this cycle and the outlook for continued growth. So far the fourth quarter has gotten off to a good start with volumes exceeding their levels of a year ago. As we refine our 2019 full year guidance, we anticipate total revenue and EBITDA to be around the lower range of our previous guidance. As we look out into 2020, our preliminary view anticipates low to mid single-digit volume growth and low to mid single-digit growth in pricing. In closing, I want to emphasize that we will continue to work strategically and operationally on the areas of our business that we believe will most efficiently and effectively enhance shareholder value. We intend to actively pursue our strategic vision to build and profitably grow defensible vertically integrated positions in major metropolitan markets with an increasing concentration on aggregates in order to create unique market-leading and value-enhancing franchises, which are impossible to replicate. With this focused strategic vision, we believe we are well-positioned to successfully execute on our plans to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. Thank you for your interest in U.S. Concrete. We would now like to turn the call back over to Roshae for the question-and-answer session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Trey Grooms : Hey good morning. John Kunz : Hi, Trey. Ronnie Pruitt : Good morning. Trey Grooms : So a few on the end markets first. So North Texas, clearly strong fundamentals but you're being constrained by the drivers or availability of drivers. So I know the outlook for demand is good there, but why would this labor issue change anytime soon? And do you think that's going to continue to constrain you guys' ability to benefit from the strong market going forward? Ronnie Pruitt : Hi, Trey, this is Ronnie. Yeah, I think as we move into the future of what we're doing for labor, I mean our focus has been really on hiring and hiring and hiring and I think we're doing a really good job of attracting. Where we've seen the most impact on that is really on our turnover and the ability for these drivers to pick and choose to move not only to other companies that may be competitors but also other industries like Bill referred to earlier. So our focus now is really a retention effort just as heavy as the hiring effort. And I truly believe we can have an impact on that. The demand like you said is there. And it's really going to come down to our ability and our customers' ability on the labor side as well with customers that place and finish also have been struggling with labor as well. So, on a positive side, I think we've got a lot of good programs in place that will be focusing on the turnover piece and the retention piece. But at the end of the day, Trey, I mean what this also should bode through as better pricing in DFW. That's what we have to see is better pricing moving forward in DFW and that's what we're going to be pushing. Trey Grooms : Okay, all right. That makes sense. And then just on the guidance. So low end of the full year top-line guide implies a pretty good rebound in your year-over-year top line growth in the 4Q versus what we saw in 3Q. And it's not the easiest comp in the world. So what's -- given the headwinds that you mentioned that constrained you in the 3Q what's the level of confidence in getting to that low end of the range? John Kunz : Trey we feel pretty confident. I mean if you look at the guidance that we gave -- if we're guiding to the low end of the range, it's really suggesting the revenue right around that $400 million mark maybe a little higher to get to that low end of the range. And your EBITDA number is going to be $56 million-plus right in that range. When you talk about that in light of how we performed in Q3 and your quarter-over-quarter comparison, we feel relatively confident with where we are. As Bill mentioned, our volumes are ahead of where we were last year at this time. And if we see continued progress like we have in the first month or a little bit over a month now, we feel pretty confident that we can get there. Trey Grooms : Okay. Last one for me is the ship being down if you could quantify the impact from that in the quarter on your shipments? And are those shipments delayed? Or were they picked up by somebody else? Or is it just kind of gone? And then also is that issue behind you at this point? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes the issue is behind us and it is a delay and it is deferred and it does -- it's not picked up by anyone else. And really where it impacted us was in the Southern California going to long -- it was a ship going to Long Beach. And so the delay on -- if you said there's 70,000-plus tons per ship and we missed about a ship and a half, I mean that's kind of the context of that. But it's not lost it's deferred because those projects are specified with Polaris Materials. So, we will be continuing to supply those projects. So, it was really just a flow of -- and we'll make that up. John Kunz : And that's baked into the Q4 numbers as well. Our expectation is that that ship will -- we'll be able to make those shipments up in Q4. Ronnie Pruitt : And Trey I would also add on your previous question what John said don't underestimate the initiatives that we have. I mean I think we're seeing good improvement in our margin profile. And I think the changes and the focus we have on optimization of our delivery costs and all the other things that we're focused on will continue to show positive results into the fourth quarter. So, I know it is a tough comp, but just to understand that we're focused on those margin improvements and that's not going to stop. Trey Grooms : Yes. And I did want to say good job on the EBITDA margin. That was a good show in there. And I know that's something you guys have been striving for and working hard at. So, hats off to you on the margin. Bill Sandbrook : Thank you. Trey Grooms : Thanks a lot. Operator : And your next question from the line of Larry Solow with CJ Securities. Larry Solow : Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Bill Sandbrook : Good morning Larry. Larry Solow : Can you maybe just discuss a little bit more on the pricing? I fully get a little bit of a mix shift obviously to Dallas area which is growing faster. But can you maybe just give us a little more color on the individual markets? And then the trends in Dallas perhaps maybe I think the price increase late in this year will help next year? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes Larry, this is Ronnie. So, I can give you some broad trends on what we're seeing in the markets by a regional profile. I would tell you on the West side even though we're seeing -- what we've talked about on the housing slow, the pricing is extremely strong. And we're seeing mid to high single-digit price increases year-over-year in the West. In the Northeast, the Atlantic market we're seeing the same kind of trends with mid low single-digit price increases year-over-year. And yes, in DFW, we've talked about the competitive nature here and the things we've seen in this market. So, I would say in what we define as Central which is DFW West Texas Oklahoma and USVI if you pull DFW up so DFW is flat to a little down the rest of the markets in Texas are good. And so we've seen the same mid-level single-digit increases year-over-year. So, it's really DFW. And I think the impact of DFW if you really go back to the second quarter and when all the weather that we talked about in the second quarter when material price increases and ready-mixed price increases are normally happening in that second quarter, there were so many headwinds there with weather that coming out of that we just saw the flatness. And I do believe you'll see the continued improvement in our pricing in the DFW market going into this year into next year and that's our focus. Larry Solow : Okay. And on the volume, I know you called out a couple of things which have been reoccurring certainly on the labor constraints. Obviously 2% a little disappointing coming off of a pretty wet Q3 of last year. But the biggest driver it's just sort of that -- the lower numbers were less than I think even you guys expect a little bit. Was it -- is it Northern California? I'm just trying to bucket that in areas that could maybe improve. Is it -- or is it just a good mixture of residential in California the labor issues in Dallas and did it -- you know or is it just a mixture? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes. I mean I think we called out mix. And I would tell you that most of that is driven by the Northern California footprint that we have. And if you look at -- I mean it's -- expectation-wise I know what people felt like we should have recovered in the third quarter in the DFW market. But overall that was our second largest quarter volume-wise for our DFW ready-mixed assets. So it wasn't overly bad but labor is. There is more work out there if we have more labor. And I think everyone is consistent in saying that that labor is the biggest force. But the market is extremely strong on the public work side, on the commercial side, on the residential side, new homes being built, new buildings being built. Everything is really strong in the DFW area, so it's just going to be a continued focus on labor inefficiencies. Larry Solow : I got it. And yes just to clarify, well definitely it wasn't bad. It's just maybe some that could be a little better but that's fine. And just lastly any update on just switching gears to Polaris. Any update on recent or pending contracts whether it be Asia or what have you and then plans for the Black Bear quarry in 2020? Ronnie Pruitt : So as far as Black Bear goes we're progressing with everything that we've talked about in the past with permitting, engineering, plant design. We have several different projects going on there with the anticipation of that being full steam ahead in the following next year's calendar year. So I think we're right on plan and right on schedule for what we think is going to be happening at Black Bear. As far as, Polaris, we still have the opportunities. We're not baking in anything for Asia. The projects -- these were project-specific opportunities, the projects that we believe -- the product would be used on in the Asian markets are some very large infrastructure projects. Those projects have still not started but we're not baking that into anything. If that opportunity comes we're in a very good position to take advantage of that. And if it doesn't we're continuing to pursue other markets that we believe Polaris has the ability to serve as well. Larry Solow : Got it. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Ronnie Pruitt : Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Roger with Exane BNP Paribas. Robert Whitworth : Hi, its -- hi, John, thank you very much for taking my question. This is actually Robert Whitworth on for Paul. I've got a couple of questions. I wanted to start with some metrics. How concerned are you about leading indicators like the Dodge index, the ABI index, which suggest non-resi markets could actually fall next year? Bill Sandbrook : Yes. This is Bill, Robert. We participate in all end markets : infrastructure which is anticipated to be fairly healthy, especially with state self-help projects; residential in most of our markets as we described earlier on the call, we are bullish going forward on Northern California. Actually the New York housing numbers in September, for total building permits that is for units to be constructed was up 68.3% over September 2018. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Commercial Construction Index has 83% of contractors reporting stable or increased project backlog, backlog meaning projects still to be built. And that's up 5% from quarter two. I'm not that concerned about the leading indicators. And in fact I'm bullish with low unemployment rates, continued low interest rates, healthy backlogs in our customer base. I'm more concerned with what we've talked about on this call on the labor being able to be available in order to accomplish all that both on our side of the supply chain and on our customers' side. Every economic forecast that we look at from PCA Portland Cement Association; the McKenzie report, all looks toward a stable to slightly growing construction environment in 2020. So I'm more concerned about making sure we have the human capital resources to accomplish the opportunities that we face. And the offset of that in a constrained labor environment it's going to be very bullish for pricing as Ronnie has already said previously in the call. Robert Whitworth : Very clear. Thank you. And just my other follow-up question. You briefly touched on it earlier on, but in terms of concrete margins, they usually fall sequentially between Q3 and Q4? Do you expect this to happen sort of this year? Or could you hold sort of the Q3 levels that you've seen? John Kunz : Well good. Yes. So Robert, if you look quarter-over-quarter versus Q4 of last year, Q4 last year was a challenging quarter for us, so we're certainly expecting to see margin improvement versus Q4 of last year. When you look at Q3 we expect -- we don't expect to achieve the type of margins that we had in Q3, so we would expect an overall decline in that area. When you look at the guidance that we gave if, we're at the low-end of the range for our guidance that would suggest right around a 13% full year margin. So if you back into the numbers that would suggest right around a 14% margin for EBITDA for the fourth quarter. So that's just the math of our guidance. Robert Whitworth : It's pretty much what we had. Thanks for confirming. Thank you very much. John Kunz : Sure. Bill Sandbrook : Thanks, Robert. Operator : Your next question from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning guys. Bill Sandbrook : Good morning, Adam. Adam Thalhimer : So the - to get to $400 million of revenue for Q4 I think that implies a pretty small sequential I guess decrease from Q3 to Q4. I mean, do you think that the ready-mixed volumes, the agg volumes for Q4 can be close to Q3? Ronnie Pruitt : Well I think as Bill talked about earlier as of October, we were right on line with where we think we need to be. So the remainder of the year is going to become -- I mean we base this on normal weather. So that's the best we can do right now as say what we believe normal weather is in our markets that we can get there. And if it's abnormal weather and we've seen both sides of it. We've seen dryer weather in some places. We've seen wetter weather in other places. So we believe right now based on normal weather that we can. The demand is there. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. And did you see any impact from the fires in California? Ronnie Pruitt : We haven't seen any structural impact. We have had some power outages at some of our facilities, but we have not had any structural damages at all. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. And then Bill, I mean you sound good on New York. It's just this issue of the union versus nonunion. Is that correct? Bill Sandbrook : I'm fine on New York and I fully believe that we have our model sorted out. It's taken a while to source drivers into the B wage rate, the lower level of our labor agreement. And that is just about completely sorted out now. The trick is delivering nonunion or B-level work with B drivers. So there's some structural differences in pricing of those jobs. And we have to ensure that we have the structurally lower-priced labor available to deliver those B projects. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. And just lastly the Dallas pricing. I think there was a price increase in October. Did we talk about that at all? Ronnie Pruitt : We did talk about an announced price increase in October, yes. Adam Thalhimer : And so do we have a sense of how that flowed through at this point? Ronnie Pruitt : I think as we've explained in the past with announced price increases in ready-mixed concrete, we get a chance to negotiate those jobs one by one. We get a chance every day literally when we quote work to move that price. We have very good confidence that pricing is going to continue to improve and that labor is going to drive a lot of that. Where in the past it's been more tied to raw materials and when cement went up or when aggregates went up. Now it's going to be more tied to labor, which I think is a very good force to move pricing in this market. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. That's it for me. Thanks guys. Ronnie Pruitt : Thank you. Bill Sandbrook : Thank you. Operator : Your next question from the line of Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Julio Romero : Hey good morning everyone. Bill Sandbrook : Hey, Julio. Ronnie Pruitt : Hey, Julio. Julio Romero : You have mentioned your focus on Texas is really about those driver retention initiatives. I wanted to ask how that works alongside the operational initiatives you're doing at the same time to optimize some driver efficiency. Just thinking about those two areas of focus from my point of view it looks like they might conflict going forward. So can you just talk about how you're planning to maybe balance both retention efforts and at the same time optimize efficiency? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes. So when we talk about retention efforts I mean the -- and we have a lot of studies. We've done a lot of work with both -- some of our national associations as well as some other independent groups. And the majority of people leaving jobs is not due to pay. So everyone just automatically says, well you must have to pay them more. It's not it. It's scheduling. It's inconsistent in communications. There's \u2013 pay is like number five on the list. And so we're investing in technology to say, we're going to give our drivers more visibility into controlling their workday and their \u2013 and the times they want to spend time with their families. I mean, it's \u2013 there's a lot of things going into this that it will not \u2013 I believe it will be the opposite. But I believe it will make our drivers more efficient, which is our efficiency goals and driving down better productivity and better delivery times. With these things we're investing in to make our drivers have more control over their daily schedule and more buy-in into what's happening and more accountability into their performance. So it's not just, we're just going to pay more money and we think that solves the problem. That's not it. Julio Romero : Understood. And maybe, if you can give us a sense of maybe within this quarter, what was the primary factor that maybe pressured some of your driver retention? Was it other ready mixed companies or other industries as you mentioned that also may need drivers as well? But looking at least for the 3Q given the better \u2013 the better weather backdrop which one was maybe the biggest factor in the quarter? Ronnie Pruitt : Yeah. I mean, if you look at it quarter-over-quarter on a year-over-year basis Dallas was still up. So it's our ability to maintain and put drivers in the seats is really our ability to meet anticipated growth moving forward. I mean, it's not like we're looking up and saying, wow, we lost 15% or 10%. I mean, we were up year-over-year, so it's more of our ability to predict and anticipate and put more drivers in the areas and when you look at Dallas talk about the DFW Metroplex because it's not as easy as saying, well it's just Dallas. It's 20-plus plants scattered over a 150-mile radius that we consider DFW Metroplex. So it's a big area where we're trying to attract in the Northern suburbs, the Northwest Fort Worth at Southeast in the Midlothian area out to Forney. I mean, all these areas have so much growth going on, but it's really our ability to reach outside of Dallas and find drivers in a lot of these remote areas. And so that's our focus. But I just don't want to lose the fact that Dallas was up, and we're continuing to see great opportunities which as Bill said and as I want to reinforce gives us extreme confidence in our pricing in this market. Julio Romero : Helpful. If I could just squeeze one last one here is do you still feel on track to drive those 150 basis points of margin expansion underlying over the next 12 to 18 months? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes. I think we're very much online and we have those programs in place and we're tracking everything. And at the end of the day as someone has mentioned, I mean, it's our confidence in the market too. So, when we have the confidence we have in the market, we can put these programs in place to drive more efficiencies based on the underlying demand of our products that we believe is very strong. Julio Romero : Great. Thanks very much and best of luck in Q4. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking question. I apologize, if you guys mentioned this. Did you all say anything about backlog at the end of the quarter and I missed it? John Kunz : No. Stanley, we didn't. And one of the things I mentioned I think I mentioned with you and after your conference as well our backlog is non-contractual. So I mean, it's not really a good indicator. I mean, we provide revenue guidance, but with that said our backlog is consistent with where it was last year. We were right around the eight million-yard mark. Last year in Q3, our backlog was the same. But going forward, we don't anticipate continuing to provide that just because we do provide revenue guidance and it's non-contractual. Stanley Elliott : That's fair. And you all talked about some of the improvements that your customers are seeing and that you're seeing from some of the analytics that you're putting out in the marketplace. I guess, one is it going to require additional capital spend into next year for that? And then two is there any sort of way to quantify some of the savings that you all are seeing or maybe they're seeing and making you more of a preferred vendor? Ronnie Pruitt : It is going to require additional capital spend. So we're in the middle of both the rollout and the development and we'll continue to develop. On WheresMyConcrete and our CRM, the benefits that provides us is that we're in control and we know what drives our business. So we know what technology we need to develop to focus on the areas that are really impactful around the lack of analytics or the lack of decision-making. So everything we do in that system is going to make us a better company not only for ourselves operationally, but for our customers to do business with. So we've rolled out not only the dispatching system in New York and Washington D.C., New Jersey. Now we're starting in Texas, we're also rolling out the customer apps. It gives our customers more visibility into their orders, into their timing of trucks, into their billing, electronic billing, paperless. I mean, all these things we're doing as an industry, which may sound very slow to the normal person that says, we've been doing this in our real lives for 10 years and the ready-mixed industry is just catching up, which is true. But just think about the efficiencies we believe we can gain -- just the efficiencies you've gained in your life off of your technology. And that's what we're pushing is to catch up to where real life is and we've got some -- a lot of steps to take. So we're going to continue to invest in -- and it's both development cost and headcount and people, and then as we roll out training and more development of our own internal users of it. John Kunz : Yeah. So Stan, let me clarify too just for the accounting side of it. When you talk about capital investment, it's both going to be capital from a CapEx perspective, and then an investment from an operating expenses perspective. So we will be incurring additional costs from an operating expense perspective for this as we head into 2020. Stanley Elliott : Okay. And then lastly, is there a way to kind of quantify the savings you all are going to see on a kind of run rate go-forward basis by kind of differentiating the A labor rates from the B labor rates in New York, or maybe how much you could save? And then, I guess, lastly the confidence around having all of that kind of matched up here on a go-forward basis. Ronnie Pruitt : Yes. So when you talk about the difference in A versus B and our ability to serve the B market with the right amount of drivers in the seats and the right footprint that we have that difference is on the labor cost side of it. It's about a 10% to 15% savings on just labor cost alone and then our ability to right source that. And so where we're located at being able to -- that didn't affect the delivery cost of it with the other efficiencies we gain. So that's kind of the magnitude of where we could pick up on the delivery piece of that. Stanley Elliott : Perfect guys. Thank you very much. Excellent. John Kunz : Thanks Stanley. Operator : And your next question from the line of Bill Newby with D.A. Davidson. Bill Newby : Good morning guys. Bill on for Brent today. Thanks for taking my question. John Kunz : Hi, Bill. Bill Newby : Bill you mentioned the strong permit you did in New York. I guess, do you see any potential for a more significant volume shift, I guess back into the Manhattan area from the boroughs over the next year just given what you see in front of you? Bill Sandbrook : Well, I would say perhaps marginal, because we are in a little bit of a lull on high-rise construction in Manhattan. But we're looking at equivalent margins on A and B work. So, I wouldn't look at the mix of A of a high-rise versus mid-rise, low-rise construction in Manhattan versus the other four boroughs as a real determinant of our profitability or overall EBITDA opportunities in New York. I think what's much more important is our ability to deliver B rate work with B rate drivers to drive that margin effectively. So I'd say some marginally -- some margin -- marginally improved high-rise construction, but that's not the driver of it. I am bullish on overall New York opportunities. Bill Newby : Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess on the aggregate side, it seems kind of industry commentary for next year seems to be for price to be kind of in that mid single-digit range. I understand you guys don't want to get too far ahead in guide for next year, but is that kind of consistent with what you're seeing and a reasonable starting point as we think about 2020? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes. That's consistent. Bill Newby : All right. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Ronnie Pruitt : Thank you. Bill Sandbrook : Thank you. Operator : And I will turn it back over to Bill Sandbrook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks. Bill Sandbrook : Okay. Thank you Roshae, and thank you everyone for participating in the call this morning and for your continued support of U.S. Concrete. This concludes our call and we look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year earnings with you in February. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Kevin, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Now, I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Welcome everyone to Vulcan Materials\u2019 fourth quarter and full year earnings call. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is accompanied by a press release issued this morning and a supplemental presentation posted to our website. Additionally, a recording of this call will be available for replay later today. Before we begin, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results, the projections -- and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and other information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. 2019 represented another year of strong earnings growth and demonstrated the strength of our aggregate-centric business model. But before we talk about our accomplishments for the year, I want to spend a few minutes telling you about the good progress we made again in the fourth quarter. Aggregates gross profit was $274 million, a 7% improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter. Aggregates shipments increased by 4%, with markets in the Southeast and Southwest reporting strong growth. For the quarter, freight adjusted average sales prices increased by 5.5%, all key markets reported year-over-year price growth. And the 70 basis point benefit from mix was due in part to above average growth in Gulf Coast markets. They are severed by our unparalleled logistics network. This growth is noteworthy. The fourth quarter of 2018 made for a tough comparison with a 24% increase in Aggregates gross profit, 8% growth in volume, and 5% mix adjusted price growth over 2017. Gross profit per ton in the quarter improved $5.32 and was negatively impacted by three things, most of which are timing and mix related. First, repair and maintenance costs were higher in the quarter. As we said before, certain types of repairs and maintenance are routine and scheduled. Therefore, the associated costs are more predicable.  Other repair maintenance activities are planned annually, but the exact timing is more difficult to predict with precision. You monitor the situation throughout the year to determine the optimal time to do the work and as a result the cost can be lumpier. This quarter includes several of these types of repairs. In addition, the rigorous inspection and maintenance protocol that we rolled out as part of our operational excellence initiative in early 2019 grow some of our costs higher in the second half of the year. We expect to continue to see additional repair and maintenance costs in 2020 and have incorporated them in our guidance. Setting high standards is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business. Our employees are highly engaged, and they are focused intently on the mobile equipment and fixed plant inspection and maintenance aspects of this initiative. In doing so, we can preempt or avoid equipment failures, which could result in much more expensive repair cost. The second factor that impacted our gross profit in Aggregates was actual geographic mix versus our expectations. Our fourth quarter shipments were robust in markets along the -- along the Gulf Coast, which are served by rail and water. Remote serve markets carry higher selling prices, but also carry higher cost, particularly if the tons are shipped by rail versus blue water. In the fourth quarter higher volumes from rail distribution, negatively affected margins. The third factor was lower revenue and earnings from certain aggregates locations, which also generate tipping fees on clean fill. This result was mainly a matter of timing of projects expected to contribute to the fourth quarter. Instead, the projects were delayed, but will benefit 2020.  Finally, I'll also highlight our fourth quarter asphalt results, where gross profit increased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter last year. This was driven by 10% improvement in shipments and a 3% improvement in average selling prices. In addition, we expect -- we experienced volume growth in California, in spite of wet weather in the fourth quarter. These volume and price improvements in addition to a 12% reduction in the average unit costs for liquid asphalt drove a 52% improvement in unit profitability in asphalt. Suzanne will share with you the detailed numbers in a moment. But first, I'd like to summarize our full year 2019 accomplishments and talk about why we're excited about 2020. Let's start with the most important aspect of our business safety. In 2019, our people led us to another year of world class safety performance despite being busier than ever. We also completed the rollout of all of our strategic initiatives commercial excellence, operational excellence, logistics, innovation and strategic sourcing. We believe these initiatives will help us accelerate growth towards our long-term goals. On the financial side, aggregate shipments grew by 7% and average freight adjusted sales price was 5.6% better than 2018. Aggregates gross profit increased by 16%, and unit profitability grew by 8%. Cash gross profit per ton was $6.74, another step forward on the path to our longer term goal of $9 per ton. And while our Non-Aggregates segment gross profit was flat year-over-year, the second half showed signs of improving trends in the Asphalt business. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year grew by 12%. And importantly, our return on invested capital increase to 13.9%. As a whole, we were pleased with our annual results. But we aren't satisfied with just setting records. Our focus is on getting better every day and reaching our potential. As we enter 2020, we are well-positioned to take advantage of supportive markets and deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth. Our markets will continue to benefit from both public construction demand led by highways and a resurgence in demand on the private side, particularly residential. The public highway demand is there, as all the revenues to support the investment. As we seemed -- excuse me -- as we said before, it's not a matter of if, but rather when the projects are finally started and shipments begin. To be fair, we seem -- we've been a little bit disappointed over the last couple of months with the speed with which the states are letting work. However, we remain confident that these projects are a go in the near to medium term. With respect to residential demand, which we've been a bit cautious, but now we're seeing a very positive turn in leading indicators, with Vulcan markets outpacing the rest of the country. Underlying demand fundamentals, including population and employment growth remain firmly in place and underpin our expectations of growth in private, residential and non-residential construction. These demand characteristics a catalyst for positive pricing environment in 2020. And demand visibility is also an important contributor. With our geographic footprint, focus on the higher growth markets, we are in the best position to capitalize on public and private demand. So what does all this mean for 2020? We anticipate a 2% to 4% growth rate in aggregate shipments. Aggregate freight adjusted sales prices are expected to increase between 4% and 6%. Additionally, we maintain our longer term view of approximately 60% same-store flow through rate to gross profit on a trailing 12 month basis. Overall, we are looking at double-digit growth in Aggregate segment earnings. Moving to our Construction Product segment, we expect 10% to 15% growth in gross profit collectively. This contemplates relatively stable, liquid cost in Asphalt. I'll now turn it over to Suzanne for further comments on our 2019 full year performance and 2020 guidance. Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Tom and good morning to everyone. In 2019, our Aggregates volume growth reflected the solid underlying demand fundamentals in our market, including growth in population, households and jobs. That is two to three times that of other markets over the next 10 years.  Shipments in certain markets in the Southeast, Mid Atlantic and Texas were particularly strong. Average sales prices in Aggregates increased and higher prices were widespread, with all major markets reporting improvement. For the full year our costs were up 4%, contributing to a 48% same-store aggregates flow through rate. As Tom mentioned, there were several factors that affected this rate, particularly in the fourth quarter. Our segment gross profit increased by 16%. This continued progression underpins our ability to deliver attractive earnings growth. SAG expenses while higher in absolute dollar terms decreased as a percentage of total revenues. Moving on now to the balance sheet, cash flows and return on investment. We made progress in each of these areas. Our balance sheet structure remains strong, with a weighted average debt maturity of 14 years, and a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. Leverage was reduced from 2.6 to 2.2 times, well within our target range. We generated $820 million of discretionary cash flow and we followed our capital allocation priorities to determine the most shareholder returns enhancing use of that cash. In 2019, this included investments and attractive growth opportunities, as well as return of cash through dividends and share repurchases. And as a result, our return on invested capital improved by 130 basis points on an adjusted EBITDA basis. I'll move on now from 2019 to 2020. Tom has already covered the operational aspects of our segment guidance, so I'll comment on a few other points. SAG expenses are forecast to be approximate $365 million in 2020. This represents a reduction in absolute dollars, as well as the reduction in the ratio of expense to revenue. We already have taken steps to ensure we are efficiently leveraging our overhead. We anticipate that interest expense will approximate $125 million and that depreciation depletion, accretion and amortization will approximate $385 million in 2020. And our effective tax rate -- our effective tax rate will be approximately 20%. The combination of these assumptions lead us to an adjusted EBITDA range of $1.385 billion to $1.485 billion for 2020. The midpoint of this range represents a 13% increase as compared to 2019. Moving onto our cash flow expectations. Remember that our business is an inherently cash generative one, and 2020 will be no exception. We anticipate discretionary cash flow of approximately $800 million. As you model our cash flows, I'll share some thoughts to help you fill in the blanks. As guideposts, we will continue to adhere to our unchanged capital allocation priorities in directing our uses of cash, and we will stay within our target leverage range. We expect the cash interest expense of $120 million, operating and maintenance CapEx of $275 million and finally, cash taxes of $180 million. The discretionary uses of our cash involved returns to shareholders, internal growth capital in acquisitions. Let me cover each one of those. First, we expect to maintain a progressive dividend, generally growing it in line with earnings to a level that is fully sustainable through the cycle.  Second, we expect to spend approximately $200 million on growth CapEx for projects that are already largely underway, as we did not spend the full amount of growth capital we projected in 2019. These projects include the opening of a new quarry in California, capacity expansion at other quarries, as well as improvements to our logistics and distribution network and sales yards. And third, we will continue our disciplined evaluation of acquisition opportunities as they arise, only investing in those which fit our strategy and offer superior returns and synergies. And last, we will continuously evaluate the use of opportunistic share repurchases as a means to return excess cash to shareholders. And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thanks, Suzanne. Now before we go to Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women of Vulcan Materials for their hard work and their dedication. They have taken good care of our customers and have improved our business processes and disciplines. Importantly, they promoted our strong safety culture and are responsible for delivering our industry leading safety metrics. As we move forward, we will continue to capitalize on our strengths, our aggregates focused business, our outstanding geographic footprint and our local execution capabilities. We will also remain focus on compounding our unit margins through the cycle and improving our return on invested capital. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead. Stanley Elliott : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Tom, could you talk a little bit about the cost structure kind of puts and takes as we're heading into 2020? You mentioned some of that being played in the current guide. Does any of this roll off? Just trying -- curious to see how you guys were thinking about the cost piece. Tom Hill : Sure. If you look at the fourth quarter, the average cost or unit profitability was, as I said, was impacted by three unique items. And pretty much equally, all three of those items are somewhat of accommodation of mix and timing. The first one is a large clean fill project, which we will we take dirt in the quarry for tipping fee. The job was temporarily stopped, but it will start back up in 2020. So, we'll see that again, we'll get that back. The second item was really geographic mix. It was increased volumes to remote distribution rail yards on the Gulf Coast, which is a good thing. It just comes at a higher cost, with the simple reason that you experienced not only the quarry costs, but also the yard costs. And you couple that with -- we had a little bit lower volumes in the Mid Atlantic states really due to the timing of work. And then the third item was increased equipment maintenance cost is really driven by our equipment inspection efforts as part of our operational excellence efforts, which we kicked off in February last year. And this is really to prevent catastrophic equipment failure. It improves operating efficiencies and actually improves customer service. And while the costs were higher in Q3 and Q4, because of these efforts, our long-term focus on maintenance is just the right decision for the company. Now, those efforts will benefit us later this year. As over time, it improves cost by helping to eliminate expensive failure costs and really the expense of downtime. And I would expect some of these costs to continue for a bit into 2020. But all that's built into our full year 2020 guidance, and I got to tell you I'm very pleased. This takes a lot of work and a lot of effort and I please will operators performance here. Stanley Elliott : No doubt. And then sticking on the cost side, can you just speak to the leverage you\u2019re seeing on the SAG line? I wanted to call SG&A, but I feel like that tracking below 7% of sales, maybe one of the best the company's history. Talk a little bit about how you're driving that down when your revenues are going to be up double-digits. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. Sure. I'm happy to do that. And good morning to you. The SAG area, which is predominantly corporate and administrative type costs, is an area where we are continually focusing our attention. If you look at the fourth quarter and you look at full year of 2019, while the absolute dollar amount is higher, we did reduce it as a -- cost as a percentage of revenue and that's something that we had been really focused on as part of our budgeting process. And as we move into 2020 I mean, look, we want to make sure that we are delivering the appropriate services to our operational folks. And we have looked across the footprint, particularly in those corporate and admin functions for ways to be more efficient and effective in delivering those important services to people, and sometimes that is just finding more efficient ways to do things. Sometimes, it's using technology. You just use a number of things at your disposal to try to effect some change. So, you'll see those efforts which have already begun some -- some are completed as we speak. You'll see that reflected in the 2020 guidance and we are absolutely driving toward not just a reduction of those cost as a percentage of revenue, but also a reduction in the absolute dollar amount, and we have plans in place to do that. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. Thank you very much for the time and best of luck. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning, Trey. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Trey Grooms : Good morning. So, I guess, I'm going to talk more -- or my first question is more around the volume. So, one, 4Q -- the 4Q volume, you did see a little bit of a deceleration there relative to what we saw in some of the other quarters. And then seeing the volume going from 7% or so, I guess that you put up 19% in aggregates to the guidance this year of 2% to 4%, it's my first question, can you talk more specifically about how we get there and what your end market expectations are, or your assumptions for your end markets, public, private, non-resi and residential, that you have baked into that. Suzanne Wood : Hi, good morning. That's a good question. I'll just start off with a gentle reminder about the tough comp that we had year-over-year in fourth quarter, and then Tom can address some more specific comments. If we look at the fourth quarter of 2018 from the revenue perspective, it was just a really strong quarter. We had an 8% growth in volume, which led to a 24% in aggregates gross profit. So, I think with the volume increase of about 4% in the quarter this year, I mean, frankly, that's -- I think that's pretty decent growth. It's well within our guidance range that we set forward at the beginning of the year and coming off. So, very good fourth quarter we had last year, I'm not completely surprised by that. Tom Hill : Yeah. I would add to that. The 2% to 4% growth in 2020, I think is our -- trying to be thoughtful about taking everything into account, demand, timing of shipments whether comparing it to 2019. So, remember that this -- that we saw a little bit slower starts and leading indicators on the private side and in the third quarter kind of July to October, that has now picked up and picked up dramatically. And it could flow through a part of 2020 as a short low or it could just -- what we're seeing right now to look through it, we just don't know quite know yet. On the highway side, funding is up, demands is up. And public works for the first time, non-highway public works picking up. Still, there's quite a bit of unknowns about -- again about how fast DOTs can get jobs let and to work. The funding is there, but it has to be about timing, I think. We are also not going to have -- as Suzanne said, we're not going to have a first quarter 2019. Last year we had a windfall, we were 13% as we had pulled forward from the prior year. And then 2019, we didn't have any hurricanes or tropical storms that impacted us in any material way. I think the 2% to 4% volume growth in our guidance is a thoughtful approach as we pull all those factors together. I would point out in all of this, that we will see growth in all four end markets and the one that's coming on, and we're pleased to see is that the non-highway infrastructure pieces is now rolling. Trey Grooms : Got it. Okay. And Tom you mentioned the 1Q of 2019 having a pretty good showing there, with some windfalls. How should we be thinking -- and maybe this is for Suzanne, but how should we be thinking about the cadence there, the volume as we look into 2020 in light of things like tough comps and things of that nature? Tom Hill : I think as always, it's going to be timing related. It'll be -- the -- we will have ebbs and flows with that, but the -- it will be timing of weather and timing of large projects. Trey Grooms : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kathryn Thomas of -- beg your pardon -- Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning, Kathryn. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Kathryn Thompson : Morning. Thanks for taking my questions today. First, focusing on Illinois, we are seeing a pick up the lettings in Illinois. I know you talked about lettings in the prepared commentary focusing on that. How do you expect forward you\u2019re seeing work, what type of projects and how big an impact could we build -- only have a state that has relatively underperformed over the past several years. Tom Hill : I think, it's hard for me to hear you. What\u2019s your question -- first of all, how's it in Illinois? And then what would -- what should we expect from how it worked? What type of work? Kathryn Thompson : Yeah. Really. What -- we've seen lettings, are you starting to see work come from rebuild only and what are your expectations for future volumes in the state from this FAST Act? Tom Hill : So, I think that Illinois, I wouldn't -- we're not expecting a lot of that funding to flow through in 2020. I think it\u2019s weighted more 2021. We still have some of the toll work and airport work which will benefit us in Illinois in 2020. On the private side, in Illinois, it's probably not one of our strengths, is probably one of the few places we're probably seeing some weakness on that. So, while the team in Illinois did good job, improving unit margins, they're not getting the benefit of big volumes, and I don't think we are going to see the highway work in Illinois, much of it until 2021. Am I answering your question? Kathryn Thompson : Yeah. No, that's helpful. That's helpful. And then also just following up on the rail network. Assume that most the volumes are out of your South Georgia ops. Could you give us -- confirm just any more color in terms of type of projects that you're seeing, that are driving demand in the Gulf? Thank you. Tom Hill : Yeah. So, it was -- in the fourth quarter, the rail work was really widespread, and it was really more timing. We're pleased with it. It's good work. It just comes at a higher cost. But it was across the board. I mean, it was Texas. It was the Mississippi, Louisiana/assuming Panhandle, out -- South Alabama, even into Florida. We really just had -- just had a good solid fourth quarter and weather helped it. Kathryn Thompson : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs Group. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Tom Hill : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering -- could you talk about the pricing cadence as we think about 2020 versus 2019, any differences in timing of price increases that we should keep in mind? And can you comment on how broad the price increases is in terms of breadth of markets as we think about 2020 versus what you put through 2019? Tom Hill : Yeah. I would describe it is very similar -- 2020 will be very similar 2019. We're continuing to see solid price improvements at this point in 2020. We are very confident and guided that 4% to 6% price improvement for the year. Our bid work, our backlogs would support this, and our discussions with our fixed plant customers would support this kind of pricing momentum. Again -- and we\u2019ve always pointed this out, but we're doing again, it's really underpinned by that visibility of the rapidly growing highway work. And a solid -- we think a solid performance will be seen in growth in the private side. And then again, now we're starting to see growth in the non-highway infrastructure. Whilst it's the smallest piece of it, it's healthy. And I would tell you that we're going to see price increases across. It's really widespread. It\u2019s across every one of our markets. Suzanne Wood : As it was in 2019. Tom Hill : Yeah. Jerry Revich : And we will have -- if you hit -- the pricing guidance will have two straight years of 5% or so. Pricing gains, it's not sustainable in the medium term. And obviously, you're looking for a lower volume growth in 2010 than in 2019. I'm wondering as we think about the medium term outlook, how would you counsel us to think about sustainable level of long-term pricing gains. Tom Hill : Obviously, we're not going to give guidance past 2020, but I -- you saw it in 2019, you're going to see it in 2020. I think the -- again, we've got long-term substantial highway funding coming and that visibility will continue to grow. So that just supports the kind of pricing we're singing. Jerry Revich : Okay. And lastly, in the past when you had pricing momentum in aggregates -- in your asphalt markets, you're able to achieve gross margin expansion. I could get a faster rate than we've seen so far in the cycle. Can you just comment on what's holding you back from achieving historical levels of gross margins in asphalt in this cycle compared to the past? Tom Hill : Yeah, well, I think -- and as far as asphalt is concerned, we're guiding to not our product lines being up 10% to 15%. Asphalt prices and unit margins are going to drive the big improvement that asphalt. We would expect gross profit in asphalt to be up double-digit. That would be probably a slight improvement -- flat to a slight improvement in liquid costs. I think the good news is that the good highway work where we experienced the big funds and the timing of that line up with our asphalt business. So the story in asphalt I think is this is we said we -- all last year we would catch and bypass liquid prices, liquid cost to improve unit margins. You saw this happen in the fourth quarter, more to come. Jerry Revich : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Morning. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Tom, I think you mentioned being disappointed over the last couple months with regards to the speed with which some states are letting work. I was wondering if you just get a little more color on which states you're seeing this and maybe the magnitude of the delays, relative to what you were initially expecting. Tom Hill : Yeah. I would describe it this way. I think at this point, where we are in the year right now, we would expect highway demand at this point be up, predict low single digit. Now that could move to mid single digit depending on the timing of large projects and really state's ability to get work let and get work started. As I said earlier for asphalt, the good news is states where we have asphalt probably have the strongest demand going into 2020, Texas, California, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee. But if the flip side of that is places like Georgia and South Carolina, they struggled at the end of last year to get work -- to get fundings let and work started. If you look at Georgia, we are still shipping three mega projects in Georgia. So that's helping, but I would tell you that highway awards data starts have been a little slower, but then again lettings -- they do ebb and flow, they come and go. All that said, I think that single digit -- that low single digit could turn quickly to push us to mid single digit. You got Georgia in the second half of 2019 where lettings were slow, now Georgia in the first half of 2020 is going to let $1 billion worth of work. Texas is looking to double their lettings going into 2021, that's already healthy. It's at $7.214 billion. California, we'd expect fund spending to up some 13%, embedded in that is a 25% increase in maintenance funding and that maintenance funding could go very fast. All-in-all, we'll experience growth in highways in 2020 and for years to come. And as -- I will give you a reminder that highway starts right now while they've been maybe a little bit slower or 20% versus where they were two years ago. So, it's growing. It's just how fast in the states get it to work. Anthony Pettinari : Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then in the release, I think you made some reference to concrete project delays. Can you talk about where you saw these project delays? And the magnitude and what do you expect this to kind of continue into 2020? Tom Hill : Yeah. They -- we got delayed two places. It was timing of big projects in Virginia. And then it was both weather and fires in Northern California where we got hit with -- on the volume piece of this. I would expect volumes in concrete in 2020 up mid single digit and recovering in both those markets. I would expect prices up probably mid single digit and I would expect unit margins in concrete up double-digits. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning. Mike Dahl : Thanks for \u2026 Suzanne Wood : Morning. Mike Dahl : Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I'm -- just to follow-up on one of the prior questions around the state lettings. What's your sense of just the underlying fundamental cause for the slower pace of lettings? Is it a -- is it a worker shortage, is it -- something in terms of the just getting things through the regulatory bodies, just a little more color on the underlying root cause there? Tom Hill : Yeah. I don't think it's external factors outside of the DOTs. It's really them being able to -- they got huge slug of funding, they got to mature into that and then they are going to have -- you got to get it estimated, permitted, let -- you got engineering that goes into this, a lot work for those DOTs, put projects out, while everybody has the pressures of workers and employment at -- this is not what's holding up the lettings, it is just -- it\u2019s holding up the states, it\u2019s just their ability to get that work planned and out and let and put to work. Suzanne Wood : Particularly as some of the projects are larger than they had been in the past. The larger the project that just adds a degree of complexity to the process. Mike Dahl : Okay. Thanks. Second question, just thinking about the incremental margins, if I look at 2019 and on the whole, the difference if my math is right in terms of the incremental margin and what you would target on as 60% would be about $60 million in EBITDA and so understand some of the one time issues or transitory issues that you've been talking about. But it's pretty big number and this is in a year where you had everything kind of working for you in terms of volume price and your internal initiatives. So, as we go into 20, I guess what I'm getting at is really just -- what's giving you the level of confidence that you can get back to the 60%? Is it actually -- volume was too hot in 2019? And so it gives you go into 2020, the stripping costs aren't as high or just trying to understand that bridge little. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. I will comment first and then I'm sure Tom will have a follow-up comment. I'm -- I can't say I'm quite sure about your math on the $60 million, but with respect to the 60% that is -- we say this often that is a long-term average, you're going to have some quarters and some years when you hit it some quarters, you're below it. We have had a couple of years where we were just above that. In fact, if you just look at 2019 for the trailing 12-month period ended in September we were right at 60%. So I think when you look at the flow through for this year it really does revolve around those three items that Tom called out, had it not been for those we would have been much closer to that number. And some of those were timing and mix related and to the extent it\u2019s timing and mix related, you won't have that pressure into 2020. Tom Hill : Yeah, I think, fundamentally, this is not an inflationary issue. It's more about timing. We talked about the remote distribution, that's a good -- that's really good, because it's more volume for us. The fill work will come in 2020. As far as what we did in Q3 and Q4 was stripping and preventive maintenance. I think those are just got that operating disciplines. First of all, the stripping is an investment and in pits. While it's cost -- it's a one time thing for a while as you develop pits and get ready for future volumes which we think are going to grow. On the maintenance side, it's really about -- we want to control our equipment, don't have the equipment control you and make sure you do in a timely manner. Let me just give you like a real life example of that. If you were to take a seven-foot cone crusher down, due to oil samples, it cost you $50,000. If you wait till it failed, it cost you $150,000 and that's just the tip of the iceberg cost because now you're taking the plant down which is very expensive. And if you look at underneath that where we are from really important metrics like tons per hour to a plant downtime or tons per man hour, you are seeing improvement. It's an investment. We started February with investment in our people operations -- through this operational excellence program, allows us to maximize the long-term efficiency of operations. And I\u2019d tell you that I'm confidence that these efforts will improve our profitability of the company. And I think we our folks have taken those into account as they created their plan and their guidance for 2020. Mike Dahl : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Rohit Seth of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Rohit Seth : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on if resident -- if residential construction grew faster than you expected in 2020, would there be any ASP or mixed benefits or maybe on the cost side? Tom Hill : No, I think it would you -- residential has a good mix of both base and clean stone. I think it would flow through like everything else. Although -- and that is something we'd love to see. So, we got our fingers crossed, but I wouldn't expect any big price mix change or unit margins mix change. Rohit Seth : Okay. And then on your incremental margins, just kind of building on some of the things you've already said, but last three years, it's come under the 60%. I'm curious how much of equipment failure has been part of that issue? Tom Hill : Well, I think as we do that -- we talked about same-store and same-store in 2018 finished 65%. 2019 was -- so we have years that are up, we have years below. I think as you look at it -- and I would point out to you the same-store -- and you could have times when it's higher, you're going to have times when it\u2019s lower, will guide you back to the 60%. Rohit Seth : Right. Suzanne Wood : The other thing -- I'm sorry, I was just going to add. I think the other thing for us is -- the real question is we look through some of these fourth quarter cost is, is there something there that is indicative of a significant shift in the cost performance of the company, is something going on there that has materially changed the cost structure of the company. And that to me would be the real important sort of carry forward question into 2020. And again, as we go back through those items, our view internally as we've talked a lot about them is, no that there isn't something that is a significant change in the cost structure of the company. And for that reason, even though there can be some volatility in it between quarters or years, we, on the long-term basis, guide back to a trailing 12 of 60%. Rohit Seth : Understood. And then on the M&A pipeline, can you provide any thoughts and what you're seeing out there and maybe your appetite. Tom Hill : Yeah. As always we've some projects both large and small that we're working. Again, as we always tell you its discipline. Everything does not fit us. It's got to be unique to have synergies for us, have the discipline that if it's too expensive won't be able to walk away from it. And really importantly is once you get it, make sure you integrate it very fast and very accurately. So, we've got a number of them working. We'll just -- again all of them don't fit us, so we'll be picky about what we buy. Rohit Seth : Any deals of size out there? Tom Hill : There are -- it's both. It's both -- some large ones and some small ones. I don't think there's any mega ones out there, but I would -- this full gambit. Rohit Seth : Understood. All right. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Wood of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Michael Wood : Hi, good morning. Suzanne Wood : Hi, Michael. Michael Wood : I was hoping you could quantify the repair and maintenance a little bit more. Curious if you could tell us how much it is as a percentage of COGS? And should we think about this is a purely variable next year in terms of increasing alongside volume, or could it maybe decline after being elevated this year? Tom Hill : I think what -- we would guide you to that -- this is that I think you may see a little bit more of this in the first few months of the year. And then, I would expect it to level off to meet the guidance that we've given you. And I would call that out is both some stripping and some repair and maintenance, but I think we're confident as we look at our hand for the full year guidance of how that flows through -- our cost flows through for the year. Michael Wood : Okay. In 2019, I know you were talking about throughout the year -- earlier in the year, some lower mixed ongoing on to the larger highway projects. I'm curious if you can give us an update on that? Is that continued, or you seeing kind of mix up as those projects mature? Tom Hill : I think what we saw in -- the mix that we saw in the quarter was a little bit of geographic and a little bit of product mix. As we called out, I think was that for the year our performance was right in line with guidance. The full year was 5.5, mix adjusted 4.8, and it was in the impact of asphalt size is it really driven by highway work. Geographic mix, a little bit higher volumes on the Gulf Coast and the Southeast. Michael Wood : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies. Phil Ng : Hi, guys. Tom Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Phil Ng : Good morning. Appreciating that there are some delayed lettings and potentially some downdraft from private, couple of tougher comps. Would be helpful, Tom, if you give us some color how to think about the shape of the year from a growth standpoint? Tom Hill : Yeah. Good question. I would expect -- first of all, you have got a really tough comp in Q1, because volumes last year were up 13% and it was really that you had the pull forward from 2018 into 2019. And other than that I would call it one of timing of large projects and timing of weather and we also had a very -- the weather in the first quarter of last year was -- with exception of California was quite good. So -- and you guys can look outside and see what's happening right now with the weather in first quarter this year. So, all-in-all, I think it's timing of weather in large projects. Phil Ng : And Tom, you're not calling for any delay of larger project at this juncture, which would you can't predict at this juncture, if I'm interpreting your kind of ...? Tom Hill : Yeah. So -- yeah, we're shipping a lot of big projects right now. We called out three in Georgia. We've got a number of different places. I believe it's going to be how fast the highways can get the jobs let and to work. Phil Ng : Okay. Tom Hill : And we talked about that a little bit where there was fast and we were slow what we call it out with Georgia and South Carolina, which slot. The second half of last year's lettings which flow into 2020 and slow, but the first half of this year they've got huge letting. So, we'll see -- how fast the work get started. Phil Ng : Got it. And then based on your guidance for your downstream business for 2020, it's a touch below what you thought actually, coming into 2019 initially, just given some of the project delays you saw last year and frankly a more manageable liquid asphalt price environment. I'm little surprised you're not expecting more strength. Can you give us some of the puts and takes? Tom Hill : Yeah. I think what we see is real strength in unit margin improvement in asphalt and up double-digit. We're calling for liquid being flat to slightly down. And our volumes are just up slightly. And the -- that again will be determined by the timing of this DOT work and how fast it gets started. You got to remember we had two -- we had big projects in asphalt in Tennessee and we had the big 202 project in Arizona, which neither one of those were repeating going into 2020. So, they were windfalls in 2019, they are not going to repeat, even with that we're seeing slight improvements in volume and so that get much bigger -- they'll have to accelerate work is in some of the lettings that I talked about. Phil Ng : Got it. Tom Hill : The thing I'm encouraged about -- I said in asphalt is -- you saw those margins turn in the fourth quarter, we have been predicting that kind of chasing that through the year 2019, now we see -- we carry that momentum into 2020. Phil Ng : And just one cleanup question, Tom. When you said flat to down liquid costs, are you calling sequentially or is that more on a year-over-year on \u2026? Tom Hill : But I think -- importantly with that we're going to manage what -- a number of what happens the last fall, we're going to manage that unit margin in asphalt appropriately. So, the liquid prices fall, we'll see that accretive to unit margins. And like I said the good news is -- we call it and keep growing it and I think we'll see that as we continue to perform in 2020. Phil Ng : Okay. Thanks a lot. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Seldon Clarke : Hi. Thanks for the question. Tom Hill : Sure. Seldon Clarke : Could you just give us a sense of how the margin differs on your shipments by rail? Is this a dynamic that's coming solely from higher demand in these particular areas, or has the cost of service provided by the rails change with some of the ongoing initiatives that they've been putting into place? Tom Hill : Okay. I would point out this way. In general, the rail tons is just going to be a little lower margins where -- and that's -- and higher price, higher costs, a little bit lower margins, but very good margins. So, it's good work. I mean, the volume being up is a good thing. I would point out that in contrast, the blue water tonnage is much higher margins, it would be higher price, higher cost and higher margins than the whole. So --- and what we saw in the quarter was just a timing of good work along the rail that happened to ship at a higher rate. Seldon Clarke : Okay. So, nothing to do with them putting process rail in place. Okay. Tom Hill : No. Suzanne Wood : No. Tom Hill : A simple thing with quarry cost versus rail distribution, you have rail distribution plus the quarry costs which just comes at a higher price and a higher cost. Seldon Clarke : Got it. Okay. And then just a question on the 2020 guidance, there is about 700 basis points of differential in the high and low end as it relates to the year in your growth. Could you just give us a sense of maybe what's embedded in the low end of guidance, and what would you really need to see to hit the higher end of that range? Tom Hill : I think -- I would tell you is probably going to be mostly volume. I go back to timing of shipments, I go back to do we get -- do you get hit with the tropical storm or two or three. Those would be the big variables, so I think between the high end and the low end and how it lines up would be the delta. Suzanne Wood : That's right. And that's a very similar approach to what we took at the beginning of 2019 when we gave the volume guidance then, a range of 3% to 5%. And luckily and happily we wound up being ahead of that for the year. But Tom is right, it really comes down to what happens with the timing, it's shipments and weather as to whether you're at the lower end or the higher end. And as Tom said, we'll continue to watch with interest how residential -- how those starts, continue to improve throughout the year. Seldon Clarke : All right. Thanks for the time. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Garik Shmois : Hi. Thanks. Just one more ... Tom Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Garik Shmois : Hey, good morning. So, just wanted to follow-up just on the highway outlook, just being an election year with the FAST Act expiring in the fall. Do you think that could lead to additional letting delays in 2020? Just curious how these factors might play into the highway outlook and some of the sluggishness that you can see? Tom Hill : Yeah. We talked about the cadence and highway lettings, and some that they have been slow and now coming on strong and the timing of it, I wouldn't think the election year would have any impact on state DOT lettings and the least I don't think it's going to have -- it won't -- for sure will have any an impact on the FAST Act or funding from the Feds. I think people in Washington are working hard towards the highway bill, a lot of progress made on that both on the build side and the funding. I don't expect to get a highway bill in 2020. At the same time, when the FAST Act expires, I don't expect any of that funding to go down, we'll just do an extension. So, I don't see a big impact on it. I don't see any impact on state DOT lettings due to this being election year. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks. And then, just given some of the repair and maintenance costs here and some of the other items that you called out, is this all -- just to be clear within your plan as you think about your $2 billion EBITDA target you laid out your Investor Day and thinking about how that could be potentially achievable once you reach 230 million to 240 million tons of volume. Tom Hill : Yeah. If anything -- I think the four strategic initiatives, including the operations excellence initiative are giving me more and more confidence in our ability to get to the $9 that we planned. I think that our operator -- if you look -- if you were to look beneath the surface in our operations, while the headline is higher stripping and repair and maintenance costs. Behind that, I think you're doing the right things in the investing in the business for the long-term. Really importantly though is you're starting to see the key operating parameters which we measure things like tons per hour throughput through individual plants, downtime individual plants, tons per man hour individual plants, we're starting to see improvement. I think we are teaching our young people the right things to do. We are leveraging the collective knowledge and experience of Vulcan across 350 plants. So, while we see some headline things, the ultimate work that goes into this from those initiatives is starting to gel. The commercial excellence initiatives is mature. It is working, and we're very pleased with our progress there. Garik Shmois : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning. David MacGregor : Good morning. Just getting back to the 2% to 4% volume guide, and just a question I guess on construction capacity and if we get a large increase in awards and lettings. What are the downstream bottlenecks that most concern use or constraint to your volume growth? And how you accounted for that as potentially conservative element within your guidance? Tom Hill : Well, first of all, for Vulcan internally, I don't think we see any bottlenecks we can handle it. We love to see it grow as much as it could, and we will be there both from an aggregate prospective and asphalt prospective or concrete perspective. On -- as far as if lettings were to increase dramatically, I think what you see is the work would happen. The big bottleneck as always the people ask about is labor and all the labor shortages, to answer that question is, yes. I don't think it's going to hold up work, but I think it will hold up is ability to catch up once work is delayed. So, if you had a month in the wintertime, which was all rain and really cold trying to catch that up or if you had a big tropical storm come through, it's going to take you a little longer to catch it up just because they don't have the firepower to do it fast. That's how I would describe it. David MacGregor : Okay. Have you factored that in your guidance? Is that -- there is an element potentially the discrepancy between 2% to 4%, which seems fairly conservative versus the story, which seems pretty bullish? Tom Hill : I think that -- I think when it comes to volume, as I've said we tried to pull all of those factors and as comparing last year the pull through, the weather aspect of it, a little bit of a air pocket and leading indicators in the rail side and the timings of highway lettings and state's ability to get that work and when we pull all that together and the upside potential, the risk piece of it, that's what we got -- we try to be thoughtful about the 2% to 4%. David MacGregor : Yeah. That makes sense. And then second question on mix. And if you could talk about the pace of growth in your backlog. And is as your backlog building faster in your higher margin products and geographies? Tom Hill : I think -- I would describe this. I think when we looked at the 4% to 6% is best we can. If you take the mix of products of -- when I say mix both geographic and product mix together. I think we have seen good improvement in base in our backlogs. We've seen good improvement in clean stone in our backlogs and our booking pace right now as we look at it both in price and in volume will support our guidance. David MacGregor : Thank you very much. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning, guys. What did shock you if EBITDA was flat to down in Q1? Tom Hill : Well, we -- we can't give Q1 guidance. I think as we said we are comping over a year in the first quarter of 2019 with -- which was very good weather and we had the windfall of pull forward of 13% volume from the year before. I don't think you'll see that pull through. You guys can look outside, know what the weather is doing in the fourth -- in the first quarter. So, again, we're halfway through it, we'll just have to wait and see. Adam Thalhimer : And then Tom, can you walk us through the demand you're seeing right now in California and Texas? Tom Hill : Sure. I would describe California this way, I think that the -- well, let me start with Texas. The public side is very strong. The TxDOT has done an excellent job of lettings and getting work out. There is big work -- there is shipping right now, there's big work on the horizon. And as we said next year they're going to go from a wow factor of $7 billion to $14 billion. On the private side, I would describe North Texas is being driven by non-res. I'd say res is fairly flat with some exceptions, some big development North Fort Worth. South Texas housing strong, non-res, a little bit soft. Coastal Texas everything strong. And you could see some LNG work start on Coastal Texas in the second half of 2020, a little bit going now. California, Northern Cal public is very strong both for aggregates and asphalt. Private side looks good, maybe a bit flat in the Bay. Non-res is a bit soft, but leading indicators were improving. Publics on Southern California, again public very strong, highway strong, non-highway is strong. On single private -- in Southern California, probably a little bit of a watch for us with leading indicators a bit, were a bit softer in the last three months of indicators, were up over 20%. So, all-in-all, I think pretty healthy growth in both states. And I would tell you that I would expect good margin improvements -- unit margin improvements in both locations, both in aggregates and in asphalt. Adam Thalhimer : Good color. Okay. Thanks, Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adrian Huerta of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Adrian Huerta : Hi, good morning everyone and thank you for taking my call, Tom and Suzanne. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Adrian Huerta : Good morning. Quick question on cash taxes -- can you tell us how they ended last year. I believe they probably ended way below what you were expecting early last year. And right now you're back into expecting $200 million. If there is any chances that there could be lower than your guidance? Suzanne Wood : Sure. And the main reason for the reduction in cash taxes through the year was that as we started the year. We have not made a determination as to whether we were going to take advantage of the bonus depreciation or not that's a calculation that we have to go through each year because there is some interplay between it and depletion allowance that we get, when we file our tax returns as well as some other things. So, there is an actual -- while it might seem obvious, you would want to take advantage of the bonus depreciation there is actually a calculation that you need to go to ensure you are selecting the calculation methodology that gives you the most tax benefit. So, we started out the year under one assumption. We determined in the second quarter and called this out at the time that we were indeed going to take the bonus depreciation, that resulted in for 2019 us paying quite a bit less tax than we had initially intended and the estimated -- the cash tax rate was between 7% and 8%. As we start off in 2020, we are guiding to an effective tax rate of 20%, we will go through the same process again and make a determination as to what depreciation methodology we're going to use. So, there is some chance the cash tax may be lower. But we will -- we'll work through that process in a similar fashion that we use this year. Even under the -- even under the assumption of having higher cash taxes in 2020 as compared to 2019, I just point out, we still would throw off about $800 million of discretionary cash flow. So very healthy, very substantial and that $800 million could be put on a discretionary basis toward growth projects, potentially M&A, if something comes along that meets all the criteria that Tom outlined, your dividends and share repurchases. Adrian Huerta : That was very clear, Suzanne. And if I may ask another question. Can you share with us any details on the quarry that is expected to open in California in terms of when and the size and potential volumes on an annual basis that that quarry could take? Tom Hill : Yeah. So it's, in Frisco, we're not -- it probably won't open until beginning of next year -- first or second quarter of next year. Size, we're not going to actually disclose that at this point. We have a closer to -- we will talk about those things. It's been a very good market. It was taken us some 10 plus years to get this done. The team has worked very hard, and now they're working hard to build it out into a market that is -- it is very healthy and quite profitable. Adrian Huerta : Excellent, Tom. So, it's totally new market for you? Tom Hill : No, it's a market we've been in before. Adrian Huerta : Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much Tom and Suzanne. I appreciate it. Tom Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Chabran of On Field Investment Research. Please go ahead. Paul Chabran : Hello, everyone. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. First of all, concerning the rail deliveries, I think you talked about that extensively already so and my apologies you already answered. But how should we think about it for 2020 the evolution of rail deliveries. Is there any chance that it could impact your margins as it did in Q4 2019? Tom Hill : I'm sorry. The beginning of your question -- I'm sorry, beginning of your question I couldn't hear. Paul Chabran : I'm sorry. The question was related to the evolution of rail deliveries in 2020. How should we think about that, does change -- they could impact your margin as it did in Q4 2019? Suzanne Wood : The repairs and maintenance, is that what you're asking about -- the connection was a little poor -- I just couldn't hear. I'm sorry. Paul Chabran : Yeah. Apologies. It's concerning the rail deliveries. They don't defense rail deliveries that had an impact on your margin in Q4? Tom Hill : I wouldn't expect -- the rail happen to be a timing issue of big shipments in the fourth quarter. And I would not expect -- I think we've got those -- the volumes that we do out of those that rail distribution network embedded in our 2020 guidance, and I would see very little impact. Paul Chabran : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Tom Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Brent Thielman : Hey, good morning. Just wanted to -- for I think for you, Suzanne, just on the SAG expense, can you help us understand the sensitivity to growth this year. In other words, if things are going to lineup well, through the year, you start seeing 5%, 6%, 7% volume growth, can we sustain SAG below 2019 level? Suzanne Wood : Yeah. I think we can. As I said, this is a matter of what's driving that cost reduction year-over-year or the changes we talked about. Some of that is being more efficient in the way we do things. So, it's not like -- it's a variable kind of expense. It's more what I would call on the fixed side that we are making some changes and so, I think that that would be sustainable, yes. Brent Thielman : Thank you. That's all I had. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Good -- I think afternoon. I think you may have gone into 12 o'clock. So, in light of that you've been very good job in answering and being very descriptive. So, all of my questions have been answered. Appreciate it. Thank you. Good luck. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the call back to Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks. Tom Hill : Well, thank you for your interest and support to Vulcan Materials. We've enjoyed talking to you today. As you can tell, Suzanne and I are very excited about 2020. And we look forward to sharing the team's news of how we continue to make progress toward our longer term goals of $9 a ton, cash gross profit per ton. We'll talk to you throughout the months to come. Thanks. Suzanne Wood : Thanks. Goodbye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Nicole and I will be your conference call coordinator today. All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] During the Q&A portion of this call, we ask that you limit your participation to one question, plus a follow-up. It will allow everyone who wishes the opportunity to participate. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your host Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning, everyone. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release issued this morning and a supplemental presentation posted to our website vulcanmaterials.com. Additionally, a recording of this call will be available for replay at our website later today. Please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and other information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation. I will now turn the call over to Tom to begin our prepared remarks. Tom? Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. As you all know, we're living and operating in times that challenge us all, both at work and at home. We hope you and your families are healthy and safe. It's been over two months since our company proactively began taking protective measures to keep our people healthy, while continuing to crush rocks, service our customers and run our business. I'd like to begin the call by saying thank you to all of our employees, for their patience, their flexibility and commitment to Vulcan, each other and to our customers, as well as to our communities. You are doing a great job, under difficult circumstances. I am very proud to be part of your team. We had a very good first quarter. It was in line with our expectations and we didn't experience much disruption other than some wet weather. Before Suzanne goes over the quarter results, I'd like to talk about the underlying strength of Vulcan's business model and then I'll speak to how we're proactively responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the economic uncertainties that this crisis has created across our economy. First, I want to emphasize that the underlying fundamentals driving our business remain unchanged. Our aggregates-focused business is sound, is resilient and more adaptable to demand shifts than any other products in our space. We have a strong and stable aggregates franchise that was built over 60 years. As a result, we remain confident about our company with its inherent strengths that will provide long-term stability and growth. In the near term, however, these are extraordinarily complex and uncertain times that are and will continue to test our resolve and our resilience. Our approach is to identify, prioritize and to focus on what we can control and to take appropriate thoughtful and decisive actions. At times like these the ability to make decisions quickly and accurately and to execute effectively is critical. I'd like to highlight a few of the priorities that are top of mind for our management team today. First and foremost, the health and safety of our people are of paramount importance to us. Early on, Vulcan implemented a robust set of COVID-19 protections, precautions and procedures. We are following the guidance of the CDC and other health organizations to keep us working in the safest environment possible. I'm pleased to tell you, its working. Second we are focused on our financial position. We entered this crisis with a strong balance sheet and liquidity. In addition, we have taken prudent steps to further enhance our financial position, including supplementing our existing revolving credit facility with a term loan and reducing our planned capital expenditures for the remainder of 2020. Next, continuous improvement remains vitally important to us. We are utilizing our four strategic initiatives, particularly commercial and operational excellence, to improve our execution capabilities and manage our business more efficiently. Fourth, we are concentrating on real-time communication. This ensures that the management team has immediate insight into what's happening on the ground, at our quarries, in our markets and with our customers. Our top operating and functional team leaders are constantly participating in calls where discussions -- where we are discussing and monitoring the health of our employees, the business and the impacts from the pandemic. This allows us to look around corners and quickly adjust our plans, particularly with respect to possible changes in demand or the timing of construction activity. It also helps us to cascade communication to align employees to accelerate the decision-making process and to promote the sharing of best practices particularly around health and safety. And finally, we're looking ahead and focused on contingency planning, from both the financial and the operational perspective. Now, I already mentioned a couple of proactive steps we took to enhance our already strong financial position. Operationally, each division has developed detailed contingency plans and trigger points to allow us to execute well ahead of the curve depending on the pandemic's effect on construction activities. These plans include among many other items, changing our production schedules, project timing and reducing costs. Certain elements of these plans are already underway particularly around cost reduction and project timing. As you can see, we are taking many steps to adapt to the changing environment. We are vigilantly monitoring this evolving situation. Now, I'll describe what we're seeing from a demand and shipment perspective and how that translates to an outlook for the remainder of 2020. During the first quarter, we were designated an essential business. As a result, the shipment activity was good across our markets, as customers executed on their backlogs and we continued to book both private and public projects. These conditions generally continued in April. However, on the private side, we have begun to see some project schedules shift including some postponements and cancellations. This adds to our uncertainty about near-term demand. We have sufficient backlogs to stay busy, but we cannot control future demand. So, given the lack of visibility, as to the duration and impact of the pandemic and to the quickly evolving economic situation, there is just a level of unpredictability with respect to project timing and new construction starts. When we provided our previous guidance, we try to strike a reasonable and a thoughtful balance between being realistic and being cautious. We now find ourselves in a more dynamic world in which we believe the balance should shift toward a more cautious approach. Therefore, we have decided to withdraw our previous earnings guidance for 2020. We will continue to monitor all aspects of our markets. As more data becomes available and our visibility improves, we'll resume our usual practice of providing guidance. Now, I'll hand the call over to Suzanne for additional comments. Suzanne? Suzanne Wood : Thank, Tom and good morning. I'll cover some highlights from the quarter and also comment on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter grew by 4% to $201 million. This included a foreign currency balance sheet translation loss of $6 million, resulting from the rapid devaluation of the Mexican peso in March. In the Aggregates segment, our gross profit improved by 5%. On a per ton basis that translated to $4.31 or a 6% increase year-over-year. Cash gross profit per ton also increased by 6% in the quarter to $6.02. Given the seasonality of the first quarter, we typically look at cash gross profit on a trailing 12-month basis. That number was $6.82 per ton, an increase of 7%, representing another good step forward on our path to $9. This quarter's aggregates shipments were 1% lower than Q1 last year, which was a tough comp. You'll recall that the first quarter of 2019 experienced strong year-over-year growth of 13% as a result of delayed shipments from the fourth quarter of 2018. There was also some negative impact from wet weather this year in the Southeast and the Southwest, but California, Florida, Illinois and Virginia realized solid growth. All of our key markets reported year-over-year price growth, up 4.5% on a reported basis and 4.8% on a mix-adjusted basis. Unit cost of sales increased by 4%. As expected, we continue to have some impact from higher repairs, maintenance and stripping. Wet weather inefficiencies also had an impact on the cost profile in certain markets. On the positive side, lower diesel fuel costs benefited the quarter by approximately $3 million. Moving on to our non-aggregates segments. I'll start with asphalt. Our gross profit this year was a $2 million loss compared to a loss of $3 million last year. Asphalt shipments increased by 2% and prices increased by 5%. In addition, the average unit cost for liquid asphalt was 6% lower than last year's quarter and this also contributed to the expanding margins. This represented the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year profit improvement. The concrete segment also saw better results this year. Gross profit improved by 8% to $9 million led by a 10% increase in shipments and a 3% increase in average selling prices. SAG expenses declined 4% year-over-year and as a percentage of revenue improved by 90 basis points. This resulted from adjustments to stock-based compensation and earlier-implemented cost reductions. Our return on investment continued to improve increasing by 110 basis points to 13.9% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. Consistent with past practice, this has been calculated on an adjusted EBITDA basis. Tom has already commented on our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, which we further enhanced in April with the $750 million term loan. Our available liquidity is now $1.6 billion. This is comprised of the term loan, the undrawn revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Our debt structure is very good with a weighted average debt maturity of 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%. And in terms of leverage our debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a gross basis was 2.2 times and on a net basis it was 2.1 times. Tom mentioned our contingency planning efforts. A part of these plans relate to our capital expenditures. We have reduced our expected 2020 spend from a total of $475 million to between $275 million and $325 million. The majority of this amount will be spent on operating and maintenance CapEx and most of our growth projects will be placed on hold. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. But in light of the uncertainty created by the pandemic, we are most committed to operating and maintenance CapEx to protect the value of our franchise, dividends and the overall preservation of our liquidity. From an M&A perspective, our evaluation of opportunities will be even more stringent and we will remain disciplined in this area. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you, Suzanne. Before we go to Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to again thank the employees of Vulcan for their hard work and their dedication. They've taken good care of our customers, and continue to improve our operating disciplines and efficiencies. Our MSHA/OSHA injury rate this quarter was 0.75 accidents per 200,000 employee hours worked, a 15% decrease from the same quarter last year. Simultaneously, our hard-working teams have followed strict COVID-19 protocols and stayed healthy. Our world-class safety record over the last three years underscores how committed our people are to superior performance in safety and health. Our culture of putting people and safety at the center of our decisions serves our shareholders and our employees well. We are committed to making decisions about our business that will protect the financial health of the business and will ensure strong growth for the long term. We entered uncertain times in a position of strength. We will exit uncertain times in a position of strength. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thank you guys for taking the call and good to hear to voices. Tom Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Stanley Elliott : Could you all talk, I guess kind of Tom high level? I mean, obviously plenty of uncertainty in the marketplace. I'd love to get your take on kind of, what you're seeing more broadly across the portfolio maybe even a little more detail on what to \u2013 what you're seeing in trends in April if you could please? Tom Hill : Sure. I would describe April as a continuation of the first quarter. I think volumes, we've seen them shipping kind of as usual. The one exception, I'd call out would be in the Bay Area where residential and non-residential construction were not deemed essential. We're seeing that lighten up though. I mean, they've lifted that in Napa and our customers in that area are telling us that they've got \u2013 when it lifts they're ready to go both in res and non-res. So, as far as April is concerned, so far so good from a demand perspective, again, lots of unknowns out there. We've seen some postponements and some delays. So we'll see how the rest of the quarter plays out. From a pricing perspective, I would tell you the cadence again is much like the first quarter. I don't see a big delta between April and the first three months. Stanley Elliott : In pricing, the pricing was obviously very good in the quarter. I mean, should we think about the demand piece obviously there's plenty of uncertainty out there. Is it fair to assume that kind of the structures you all have in place kind of what's being done at the ground level that maybe there's a little more visibility on the pricing side? Tom Hill : Yeah. I think that the visibility on the pricing side is particularly with the disciplines that we've put in on our commercial excellence piece is very clear. For the short term, I don't see anything that would throw me off of how we \u2013 again our cadence in the first four months. So, again, so far so good in the quarter you saw it --- we were at 4.8 mix-adjusted. The mix was in the Southeast where we had a lot of rain. Most all of our January price increases stuck. We have some price increases to fixed plants and ready-mixed that go in April. Most of those went through April 1. There's a few that pushed into May, but they're going to stick. So I think prices should hold throughout 2020. And I would tell you, they'll hold even if you see volumes slide a little bit in the second half. That's one of the unique characteristics about aggregates. And we've seen that prove out over past cycles. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. I will pass along. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Kathryn Thompson : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. First for the team just a bigger picture view taking a step back could you help clarify the differences between Vulcan today versus the Great Recession a little over 10 years ago? In particular, how has end-market exposure changed, geographic mix changed, structural costs adjustments and other important fundamental differences today versus the last downturn? Thank you. Tom Hill : Yeah. Good morning, Kath. Thank you. First of all, from a market perspective the markets are just fundamentally and structurally different. And actually, they're structurally better. You don't have the overbuilding that we had some 12 years ago. If you look at it from either a res or a non-res perspective, we're still below long-term averages. You've got much better highway funding. Our core states, Vulcan's core states have made big investments in infrastructure and we didn't have that 12 years ago. And then the fundamentals are just good. I mean you've got -- you don't have the overbuilding. You've got extremely low inventories of houses. You've got low interest rates. So, just fundamentally construction demand is in a better position today than it was 12 years ago. From Vulcan's perspective, we're just a very different company. Structurally, our product lines are different. We are uniquely advantaged in the Aggregates business. We don't have any cement. The little bit of ready-mixed we have is in great markets. Our balance sheet and liquidity is much better. And then we started earlier in this to ensure that our unit margins either continues to improve or protect it. And those are those four initiatives that we talked about : the commercial piece, the operating disciplines, logistics and procurement. And as we said last year, those initiatives which are very much maturing will in good times will help us grow unit margins. If we get headwinds, it will protect our unit margins. So, we're just in a lot better place and as are the markets. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. And I would just add to that too Kathryn. I mean from my perspective, when you go through uncertain times like these having a management team that has a deep knowledge of operations. It's just so important, because you have leaders who know how to exercise good judgment and how to make decisions that are right for the business, because it's really about striking an appropriate balance between short-term and long-term decisions. And as I think about my colleagues around the table on the senior management team, certainly Tom, Stan Bass and Tom Baker, I mean these guys were Division Presidents, out in the field in the last Great Recession running a business. So, they are absolutely battle-tested. And I just think that's very important. They've got the first-hand knowledge from having put together actionable plans to stay ahead of the curve back then and that experience has been brought forth now. So I think that that is something that gives me confidence that we will be in a position to make the right decisions and execute them well. And as Tom said, I mean I think, we -- and while this is a difficult time in many ways, from a structural perspective, we're much better off than we were in the last recession anyway. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. That's helpful. The next question is really a comparison and contrast between two end markets one that has more visibility versus one that maybe is a little cloudier. On the public side, you're seeing acceleration of construction work. But also you cited states that were outperforming, overall were Illinois and California. To what extent, the public really helped to drive demand at those states, because they do have more recent structural changes in funding? And then I guess the contrast against that. Help us understand how you're thinking about the non-res end market. Our contacts aren't seeing a wholesale cancellation of projects, but projects being pushed out in terms of start date. How are you thinking about that non-res exposure? Thank you. Tom Hill : I'll take the non-res first. In the vast majority of our markets, shipments to non-res projects, it just continues to be strong. Our bookings and our backlogs continue to be healthy. Again the exception we'd call out would be the Bay Area, which we think will hopefully is starting to start back up, and we'll get that back on track. I think Houston is a watch for us. We have seen along the coast the LNG projects that -- the ones that are started are going. The ones that haven't -- had not started are being pushed back. We also see a few other non-res jobs push back; very few cancellations. I can only think of one or two to come to mind. Our -- if you talk to our ready-mixed customers, they feel good for now. I think they probably have some pause or concerns passed getting through the backlog. So there's just a lot of unknowns from a non-res perspective with the impact of COVID-19 on non-res construction. Will work bid will it continue? But, so far so good, but we're watching it closely. The highway piece is a strength for us. Currently the state DOT work is shipping normal. We've got solid backlogs. We continue to have solid bookings. However, most states are projecting, as you guys know, a decline in revenues and AASHTO would tell you that's probably on average 30%. The vast majority of our states have continued construction and maintenance as expected. They expect the lettings for fiscal year 2020 to continue as planned. Exceptions to that would be Pennsylvania, which has halted construction; Kentucky, Mississippi, which has suspended lettings; and then North Carolina, we know, came into this year with financial issues although the legislation -- their legislators are trying to fix that. The flip side of that is some of our key states Florida, California, Alabama, Texas, are all accelerating work, and that's both efficient and safer. And now what we know on this is that shipments for now are strong and good. Lettings for the near term, three or four months are solid. We don't know what the future holds for these DOTs past three or four months out. There -- none of ours have released their budgets for fiscal year 2021. So again, so far so good, we'll watch what happens, and hopefully funding will get backstop from the Feds from AASHTO, and hopefully the world will start driving again, and we'll see gas taxes pick back up. Kathryn Thompson : And just one quick just a clarification. Illinois, California, you cited them as seeing increase in demand overall. How much of that was private versus public? Tom Hill : So in California it's across \u2013 California has been \u2013 in the first four months has been good shipments across all four end markets. Illinois is more on the public side both infrastructure with O'Hare work, toll roads. And then as you know, we've got new funding coming on in Illinois for highways. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. Thank you so much. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Tom Hill : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : Tom just a follow-up to that last question on state budgets. You indicated lettings were solid for the next three to four months. From a flow-through perspective I mean is there a time frame or a time line that we need to see federal aid to states to keep the outlook relatively positive in the second half of the year? Tom Hill : Except for maintenance work which goes very fast, most of those jobs we'd tell you that the backlog six to nine months on average before you start shipping them when you book them and you ship them. But again, they're all over the place. But just as a rule of thumb, we would tell you that that backlog ships six to nine months out. Big work may be a little longer but that's kind of a rule of thumb. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then you referenced Houston as a watch market. I'm just wondering, if you could talk broadly about the impact of maybe lower oil prices to your business both as maybe a potential, modest tailwind from derivatives, raw material perspective and then also maybe as a headwind from a demand perspective? Tom Hill : Yes. So from \u2013 directly we ship very little to the oilfield. It's just not a big play for us. It's not in our \u2013 really in our geography. So we won't see the direct impact from that. Indirectly, obviously lower fuel prices will help our aggregates cost. It could help cost from a long-haul freight perspective whether that's rail ship or barge. And then we'll continue, as I said, we'll continue to watch the impact on Texas volumes, particularly Coastal Texas. We're not seeing a lot of that yet but it's a watch for us. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital. Mike Dahl : Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on the kind of Q&A or exchange around some of the past cycle comparisons. And I guess, specifically thinking about on the private side you're talking about seeing some non-res projects kind of delayed versus canceled. I'm curious if you go back to last cycle, did the early stages kind of start out like this and you kind of push out the projects as long as you can before push comes to shove and gets canceled? Or did you see kind of quicker outright cancellations trying to draw some comparisons around what to take from initially just seeing a postponement versus cancellation? Tom Hill : I think that it was quicker and you saw more cancellations than postponements. It was more dire. And again it goes back to the overbuilding, you're not overbuilt right now. If you look at homebuilders there is \u2013 these markets have \u2013 don't have any inventories. And so people want to buy a house, they've got to build them. And people are trying to take advantage of the interest rates on the non-res side with the strengths we're seeing there or data centers, distribution centers, warehouses, online commerce, education and health care. And again, those projects \u2013 I'll give you some examples of what's pushed out. We've seen a dorm and a major university pushed out. A Google project get delayed, some office buildings get delayed, a couple of Carvana facilities we saw get delayed. The only cancellation that I can think of was that Dave & Busters in Lexington. Everything else is a postponement and we'll see. Now on the res side, we saw people push out new phases of subdivision three or four weeks ago. And now we're seeing them in a number of our markets saying we're going forward with them. So while people \u2013 it's kind of a mixed bag where people are pausing and then moving forward and then pausing and moving forward. Mike Dahl : Okay. That's interesting and helpful. Second question just on diesel. You noted the $3 million year-on-year improvement in the first quarter and presumably, it would get larger, especially as we work into higher volume or typically higher volume months. But curious, I understand that, there's no guidance anymore for this year but can you help us frame up, your diesel consumption for last year in aggs? And all else equal, if you were to assume current diesel pricing on last year's shipments, what type of full year tailwind would that represent? Tom Hill : Well our \u2013 last year our trailing 12 month I think we used about 55 million, 56 million gallons of diesel fuel. Yes, there is a drop in that but I think that we can't control the price of diesel. So what we'll always focus on is \u2013 and every operator at Vulcan would know it is your tons per gallon of fuel and every plant that we operate and that's their training and that's how they look at it. You guys can do the math. We dropped from $2.26 to $2.04. And since then it's gone down dramatically. So if it was $1 it's \u2013 assuming usage is the same, it's $50 million. But again that's one of those that \u2013 that's not our controllables. And we'll \u2013 our operators every day look at how they use it. Mike Dahl : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Tom Hill : Good morning, Trey. Suzanne Wood : Hi, Trey. Trey Grooms : Good morning, Suzanne. How are you? Suzanne Wood : Great. I hope you are? Trey Grooms : Doing well. So my first question is around the FAST Act -- it's expiring in September. I think the prior thought was that we would likely get some, sort of, a continuing resolution to kind of see us through the election and into next year and maybe revisit. Do you guys think that the current situation changes that at all and the potential that we may could get something maybe more meaningful than just the CR? Or how are you thinking about that given the -- in light of the current health crisis that we're in? Tom Hill : So Trey, I'd divide that into three buckets. The first one and probably the most pressing is AASHTO's request for $50 billion to backstop the fall in state funding. This really needs to be included at COVID-19 Phase 4 bill. And I think hopefully that's going to happen because it's a real need that was the impact of the pandemic. The second bucket of this is to your point the FAST Act reauthorization. Prior to COVID-19 there was serious work underway in D.C. on reauthorization. Earlier this year, the Senate EPW Committee passed the highway portion of the FAST Act. It was an increase of I think it was about 25%, 26%. Unfortunately, the pandemic interrupted that work. The good news is the prework has been done there. So they got had a good start to it. Again, it's been interrupted. But remember that if the reauthorization isn't done by September we will get extensions. So we're not going to lose that funding. It won't go down. It will just be pushed out. And then so it's either flat or if we were to get it -- it would go up dramatically. And then the third bucket would be the discussion -- kind of the continuous discussion of a big infrastructure bill. There's a lot of talk. There's been a lot of talk for several quarters about a significant act to address infrastructure. Again COVID-19 complicates this politically, but there's also -- this is also -- this is an opportunity for that and everybody recognizes the need both from an infrastructure perspective, but also to as a stimulus package. So we'll just have to see what happens. Trey Grooms : Understood. Okay. So -- and then I guess, the next question maybe for Suzanne. It sounds like things are holding in now, but clearly with all the uncertainty seeing some level of volume declines in aggregates over the next few quarters is not entirely out of the question. So in that kind of scenario, I know the long-term goal for incremental margins is 60%. Is there -- how should we be thinking about the -- in the case of lower volume just kind of the mechanics around the decremental margins in that type of scenario? And assuming that this is somewhat short-lived in duration if there is -- if we do come into some type of a downturn? Tom Hill : I'll start off, if you don't mind. I think that's part of the beauty of the aggregates business. A big key to that is from a margin perspective is staying ahead of the curve and making sure you know what's going to happen and hit it off. We've been -- we set trigger points in these markets that aren't just volume falling. It's quoting praise, how we're quoting, our job bookings, backlog levels, the shipping pace and that's the all-in markets. A big benefit to us is that commercial excellence strategic agenda, which allows in individual markets for clear metrics that are automated, they're consistent, they're accurate and they really give us a view to the future before volumes actually fall. At the same time, you look at timing and delays and critical inventory sizes, I think, that the team has done a really good job of putting those contingency plans in place for potential volume swings and they're detailed by plant and by market and setting those trigger points. And again, that -- this is you can take production in aggregates as you know up and down very quickly as a mechanical process. So cost is a piece of this. Price is a piece of this. But at the end of the day it's that management of unit margins and our goal is to maximize those unit margins and live up to our potential. Again those four strategic initiatives are really going to serve us well in this and as we said they'll help us grow margins in good times and protect in bad times. So we'll leverage that. And I think we're in a really strong position to protect those unit margins. Suzanne Wood : Yes. I agree, with Tom. And I would just add to that look, I mean, that's why we got started on these contingency plans very early so we would know exactly what we plan to do well in advance of any volumes beginning to fall because certainly as Tom said, we understand how to reduce costs. We want to make sure that we do that sensibly. But a large part of our costs are variable and so we do have the ability to do that. We want to make sure we do the right things for the business. We do want to protect our unit margin. And certainly, as you've heard us talk about many times we are well ahead of the industry on those. And so our folks in the field understand that well. You can always say that history will repeat itself, but just as a -- just as an indicator of the company's resolve and ability to reduce cost if you look back to the last recession when certainly there was a significant decline in volume our unit margins only went down by about 10% where -- while volumes declined much more than that. So that indicates that there is certainly room for us to manage those margins. Trey Grooms : Okay. Understood. Thank you very much. And good luck with the rest of the quarter and stay safe. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Stay safe. Operator : The next question is from the line of Mike Wood with Nomura Instinet. Mike Wood : Hi, good morning. Tom Hill : Good morning Mike. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Mike Wood : Could you give us some color in terms of maybe your top three markets in terms of how that revenue shortfall in transportation revenues looks compared to that 30% national shortfall per AASHTO? Tom Hill : I don't know that I have those specific numbers, but our top markets are going to be -- the top -- if you look at our top 10 markets our top 10 states the top three would be Texas, California, Virginia. All of them have kept their lettings the same through fiscal year 2020. The only one that has not the nine out of the -- the one out of the 10 that did not is North Carolina and we all know what's happening there and hopefully they'll get that problem solved. I would tell you that Texas is very healthy based on their current revenues. California continues to be pretty healthy as does Virginia. But specifics of those top three, I'll have to get back with you. Mike Wood : Okay. And I'm curious to get your thoughts in terms of -- your shipments lags the funding that the states are putting in on the public infrastructure side. Have you looked at in terms of if funding levels drop 10%, 20% from 2019 levels, what that would actually lead to in terms of the drop-off in your shipments? Tom Hill : Too early. The short answer is really too early to tell and a lot of moving parts. I think that if you look at those states and where we are and our backlogs again those things lag six to nine months. But I think this is one of the real unknowns and uncertainties that we'll have to put together of what's it going to mean. I would tell you that our states and the top 10 that we talked about nine of those 10 have much better funding than increased their funding over the last three or four years. Only one that hasn't has been Arizona. So, we sit in a better place than most, but too early to tell. Mike Wood : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank. Seldon Clarke : Hey thanks for the question. If you just take a step back and think about the business mix from a higher level you mentioned backlogs or some of the maintenance-type work and state lettings and obviously, you've got some ongoing projects in both the commercial and residential space. But when you try to contextualize this internally or when you do your stress test, what percentage of your revenue mix do you really think is at risk from a macro perspective over the next let's say three, six, and 12 months? Tom Hill : Again, I'm sorry not to give you a clear answer to that because I just don't think there is a clear answer right now on it. We just -- we don't know the short-term or long-term impact of the shelter-in-places and it's a very dynamic situation. Even today as people start to lift it we don't know what that means. We don't know on the private side. Again, we continue to see res. Homebuilders come back and build subdivisions. We see a few projects here and there postponed in the non-res sector. So on the private side it's really going to depend on is -- do these postponements get to be meaningful? So, far they have not. Or does -- what we have booked does it postpone? Again, which we have not seen much of that at this point. So, again, so far so good, but I just don't think we have clear information either on the public side or the private side to predict that either short-term or long-term. Seldon Clarke : Okay. Any color on the states that have looser restrictions in place that -- just to give us a sense of what the continuing business looks like over the next couple of weeks or months? Tom Hill : Yes. So, in general, as we said both on the public side and the private side through April, we're shipping as usual with the one exception has been northern California actually just the Bay Area and the seven counties up there. And we think that's going to lift which will give us a boost hopefully over the next 30 45 days. It's already started again as we said with Napa. But at this point, with the shelters in -- the shelter in place over the last seven or eight weeks we've not seen a falloff. So, we would think that as those lift it would only support the shipments we're seeing today. Seldon Clarke : Okay. Is there any way to just contextualize what you mean by as normal in April whether as it relates to comps last year if there was -- what type of delayed demand from late 2018 impacted April or you're talking normal seasonality? Or is there anything to help contextualize what April look like? Tom Hill : What I would tell you is it was -- it's fairly normal compared to prior April. Suzanne Wood : Yes. And that the spillover from fourth quarter of 2018 that was really a first quarter impact last year. So, that really has no bearing on what we're talking about for April. Seldon Clarke : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Hey thanks. Just wondering just on SAG, how much of the decline in the quarter was a lower base -- share-based comp versus the cost actions you took? And how to think about SAG moving forward both in a maybe a shorter or a longer downturn? Suzanne Wood : Yes. No, thank you for the question. Probably three quarters or so maybe 60% to 75% of the amount was share-based comp. I mean that's basically tied to the share price. So, we'll continue to report on fluctuations there. The other reductions that you saw in the SAG cost, I mean, we really teased those a bit in the fourth quarter when we talked about having looked across our corporate and field operational overhead base and we made some adjustments there, really around technology and looking for ways to be more efficient as well as ways from the corporate standpoint to better manage professional services. And therefore we said, back in February, that we expected SAG to be lower for the full year both, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. Certainly that guidance was lifted, as we lifted all the other guidance, in the release this morning. And I would say that, as we think about SAG, as we go forward in these times I mean we're always looking for ways to better leverage the overhead. Just like our operations group have detailed contingency plans by plant, we also have our contingency plans with respect to SAG. So we will -- as we go forward, we will see which of those contingency plans are executed on the basis of what we see happening in the business. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thank you. Follow-up question is I was curious if you're seeing any impact to your Calica Quarry in Cancun just given some of the shutdowns in various industries in Mexico. How you're thinking about the long-haul network, just given some of the watch points across the oil markets in the Gulf coast. Tom Hill : So, first of all our people have done a great job, keeping each other safe and healthy, both on the quarries -- in the Quarry and in the shipping lines. We continue to operate in Mexico. We've been deemed, essential business. Just like the U.S. we've implemented solid procedures and protocols to petro employees. Again, we're still operating. And we're still shipping. And at this point, we don't see any interruptions. Garik Shmois : Great, thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Thanks. Good morning guys. Tom Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Hi. Good morning. Adam Thalhimer : Tom, what percentage of your shipments comes from backlog? So if backlog is stable, kind of says to me that shipments could be flattish, as we move through the year. But I don't know if there's a lot of book and burn work that would come in over the summer. Or if that doesn't come in this year, then all of a sudden, you're minus 10% on volume, something like that. Tom Hill : So about 60% of our business is, what we call, bid work which is in the backlog. And about 40% of that is large to medium projects. The other 20% is small projects, because small projects go faster. The large to medium projects again is kind of in that 60 -- or excuse me six to nine month timeframe. The other 40% of our work is shipments to fixed asphalt and ready mix plants. The asphalt will be more driven by the public side. The ready mix is using more driven towards the private side. So I mean, we've got pretty good insight into, how we're going to look there. I would tell you that as I said earlier, the systems and the procedures and the disciplines that were put in with the commercial excellence. And this was still some three years ago. And that they've been perfected, actually that's really gotten pretty accurate both from a volume perspective and a price perspective. The things we can't control in both of these are projects being delayed or projects being cancelled and the unknowns around those. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. And then, what are your thoughts on, cash flow this year, because, with the pull down in CapEx you should generate a lot of cash this year, just curious how you're thinking about deploying that? Suzanne Wood : Yeah. I -- yeah to the capital allocation question, look, our priorities are basically the same, as when we've talked to you before. The order of the capital allocation priorities is unchanged. But in light of the pandemic uncertainty, I would tell you that we are most committed to operating and maintenance CapEx to protect the value of our franchise and keep all of that in good running order. We're very committed to our dividends and certainly to the overall preservation of liquidity. And you saw us take steps in the quarter to ensure that we not only preserved our liquidity, but enhanced it. As we think about growth in M&A, you're right. We did reduce some of the CapEx that we plan to spend on internal growth projects. Those projects are pretty easily turned on and off without a lot of impact on the business. M&A, we would -- didn't do any in the first quarter. We would continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise, but applying an even more stringent lens to that, just given the current economic environment. And so, we've always been very disciplined there. And certainly we will remain even more disciplined. And at the bottom of the capital allocations priority waterfall our share repurchases -- and look, we think share repurchase is an important part of the capital allocation structure. We -- its part of that for the long-term, and we did do a little buying very early in the quarter about $26 million pre-COVID. So we're committed in the long-term. But I can tell you in the short-term yes, probably not. We will focus more on preserving liquidity and the other items I mentioned. Adam Thalhimer : Okay, great. Thank you, Suzanne. Suzanne Wood : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Roger with Exane BNP Paribas. Tom Hill : Good morning, Paul. Paul Roger : Yeah. Good morning Tom. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Paul Roger : Hi, Suzanne, well good morning. I expect you all are doing well. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. Tom Hill : Yes. Paul Roger : Okay. Just a follow-up maybe, I mean you've talked a bit there about the cash flow. Maybe I'll just have a follow-up on that. I mean, obviously, you're cutting back on CapEx. I'm assuming, therefore, your business delaying your greenfields, is the plan essentially post-COVID-19 to start them again? And should we, therefore, when we think about the sort of medium term, should we be expecting CapEx to sort of ramp back up again? And just joined to that also, can you say a bit about working capital and whether there's much more to do on that front as well? Tom Hill : I'll take the CapEx first. It's market specific as always. Those are greenfields in California and Virginia and South Carolina and so we'll ramp up or down depending on those individual markets and the needs and the opportunities. So it's -- we'll have to play that just by ear. But if the need is there and the demand is there, obviously, we're going to invest because of good investments. And if not we will hold off until it's time to invest. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. And with respect to the working capital question, yeah, we're obviously looking at that and have taken some steps to improve that. As I said the -- our cash flows and the preservation of liquidity have always been important to the company. It's one of the core tenets of how we run our business. And so in times like these obviously we're going to ramp up those efforts. So we are making sure that our accounts receivable is collected timely, making sure that we don't let any agings or anything like that slip there. And we're also looking at carefully managing our inventory levels. That's all part of the contingency planning. And certainly we will -- if there's some steps to be taken on the payable side, we'll look at that as well. Hopefully that's responsive to your question. Paul Roger : Yeah, that's great. And just as a quick follow-up. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the outlook for asphalt margins? I mean, obviously, Q1 you had prices up, bitumen down. I guess, bitumen comes down by even more given what oil is doing. Do you think you can hold that price cost spread? And actually could it even get wider as we go through the year? Tom Hill : Well, I think I would describe it this way. Our prices will continue to climb. We saw -- and you've seen a number of quarters actually in all of last year prices climb as we chased liquid -- rising liquid costs. We caught it in the fourth quarter and we said we would catch it and go past it, which is what you've seen. So I do have confidence that our pricing will continue to go up in the hot mix portion of it. I think that the liquid piece for us is an unknown. On the surface so it went down some 6% as Suzanne said in the quarter. But the future for us is unknown in liquid and there's opposing forces there. The dramatic fall in crude prices would have a lowering effect. Flip side of that is right now you've got less refinery activity because of this demand for diesel and gasoline is down. And so does that -- the question is does that put pressure on supply of liquid? So what I'm confident is our prices will go up. What I -- the unknown here is what's going to happen to liquid prices as we go forward. Paul Roger : Understood. Thanks a lot. Stay fit guys. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Tom Hill : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Good morning, or maybe afternoon for some. I appreciate you taking my question. Tom, the implementation of COVID mitigation throughout your organization, through the plants, the facilities, how quickly did everybody adapt? Do you see that continue -- was there any productivity issues? Or could there be some enhancements to operations as you think about going forward if we're going to keep these types of mitigations for a very long period of time? Are you seeing that with the customer -- with your customers that you're talking to as well? Tom Hill : So I don't -- the short answer is I don't really see a big impact on our operations on our customers. I'd tell you I'm very proud of our people and the job they have done with this and they're doing a great job both -- they've done a great job of protecting themselves. But also you got to remember there's a dynamic of this that what happens out of work and so they've been very vigilant protecting themselves and their families. We started this really early and we continue to adjust as we get new information and new procedures. Out of our 9,000 employees, we've had minimal cases. And that's -- the script protocols and staying to that it has paid off. From an operating perspective, you saw in our -- in my opening remarks about our safety record for the first quarter was excellent and continue to be excellent through April. And I got to tell you that's a real feat from our operators in that they're under a lot of pressure and with the COVID-19 protocols, which were new, they still protected themselves. Our operating efficiencies in the first four months have been very good. So they've done a great job and we've not seen any hiccups and I don't expect to see any from our perspective. And I think the same can be said for our customers. We are deemed an essential business. All of us are and we have to earn that and protect ourselves and follow the rules. And I think the industry as a whole has done a really good job with that. Michael Dudas : Those are excellent thoughts. And just my follow-up would be the mitigation and the aftermath of COVID, do you think that there'll be some trends and opportunities that will impact where your plants and your business is located to see migration? Being here in the New York City area, you do talk to people thinking about their -- look they continue to look south especially after what's going on here. Do you think that could give some medium/longer term support to your business flows? Tom Hill : I think that from where we're located both in the markets we're in and where we're located in those markets Vulcan is advantaged and that's been built over six decades as we said. So I really like Vulcan's position moving forward. There's always the question of -- the recent question of do people want to move out of the metropolitan areas and go buy a house? Gosh, we hope so. We'll be glad to supply the stone to build those houses and those subdivisions. Michael Dudas : I\u2019m sure you will. Thanks for your thoughts. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Phil Ng : Hey, good afternoon everyone. Suzanne Wood : Phil, good afternoon. Tom Hill : Hi. Phil Ng : The LNG projects around the Gulf region that you've -- you guys have talked about, can you help us size how big of an opportunity that is? And then if you had to kind of like break down what percent of those projects have started versus not yet. And then with oil prices where it's at, do you have a view if that kind of moves forward? Tom Hill : So this was always a 2021 play. The LNG projects that we said that had started are continuing and we're shipping a number of those projects today both in Louisiana and in Texas. The big work was the work that was coming. It is tens of millions of tons. That has been postponed. Again, that was more to be 2021. It was kind of icing on the cake of everything else that was going on. I'm sure at some point in time those projects will go. I think there is demand throughout the world that will want that. I think the world has to settle down some. So the timing is unknown, but I think ultimately they'll go. Phil Ng : Okay. That's helpful. And on the commercial side of things, can you help us break out your major end markets by percentage? Some of the end markets like warehouse and data centers seem to be more solid footing going forward post-COVID, but maybe hospitality and office might be more at risk. Can you kind of help us break down the major buckets from a percentage standpoint? Tom Hill : Yes. So I think that if you looked at the heavy non-res and which is some of what has slowed the lighter non-restructuring, which we talked about data centers, distribution centers, warehouses, health care education, online commerce has very much picked up. I would describe that is probably in normal times maybe half and half, but it's just over a long period of time. But any moment in time one of those is going to be heavier than the other one. And right now, it just tends to be the lighter one that's heavier. Phil Ng : Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color. Operator : The next question is from the line of Adrian Huerta with JPMorgan. Adrian Huerta : Hi, Tom and Suzanne. Thank you for taking my question. Suzanne Wood : Hi, Adrian. Adrian Huerta : Hi, Suzanne. My question has to do with the maintenance cost. If you can just give us some more details on the incremental amount that you had this quarter that flow through the income statement. And what was the total amount of maintenance costs that you had last year? And what is your expectation for the full year for this year? Tom Hill : So we had called out in the last couple of quarters that we would see higher maintenance and higher stripping costs. We talked about that in the third quarter. We talked about that in the fourth quarter. We said it would -- we would see it again in the first quarter and then it would start to level off. If you just look at the cash cost, for aggregates, it was up some 3% or $0.26. Most of that increase was in parts and supplies. And stripping -- again, you got to remember this is the worst time of the year the first quarter to operate just because it's cold, it's wet. You have big inefficiencies. So we go in and try to finish a lot of those repairs and maintenance. So when the season comes we're ready to go. That is what you saw in Q1. That's what we talked about that was going to happen. I think x volume swings, we feel good about the balance of the year. We feel like our operating disciplines and our strategic initiative on those operating disciplines are in place, and they're maturing and doing well. So I feel really good about our operations and our operating efficiencies. Again, that is -- the fundamentals of that is maximizing through -- you're looking at the R&M piece, but the fundamentals of that are how do you maximize input, minimize downtime, how do you efficiently use manpower and then you proactively inspect that equipment and maintain it and then the last is employee ownership and engagement and effective leadership is key to all of that. Adrian Huerta : Thank you, Tom. That was clear. And if I may ask a follow-up question. Can you just tell us a bit more on what happened? I mean, I heard what you said that you're taking steps to improve our working capital, but can you tell us a bit on what happened in the first quarter with working capital? Suzanne Wood : Yes. With respect to working capital in the first quarter, we had a bit higher use of working capital, because we had a little bit of inventory build. I mean, not a whole lot but a little bit in the couple of areas we called out that were fairly wet in the Southeast and the Southwest. We also had a fair bit of mobile equipment, which falls into our operating and maintenance CapEx that we had ordered in the fourth quarter. That came in and was paid for in cash in the first quarter. And so that was another fair bit of working capital. That just was timing between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And in addition to that, we also expended $26 million of cash with respect to share repurchases. And those were really the biggest components in the first quarter. Adrian Huerta : Thank you, Suzanne. Suzanne Wood : Sure. Operator : The next question is from the line of Rohit Seth with SunTrust. Rohit Seth : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Tom Hill : Sure. Rohit Seth : I just on state DOTs, the AASHTO number down 30% and requiring about $50 billion. Let's say that number doesn't come in quite at the $50 billion. I was just thinking about -- it doesn't come at $50 billion and then states could look at the highway funds as funds that they can use to pay for other areas of the budget that are in shortfall. So I think the lockboxes might be a little bit important right now. Do you know offhand, which states in your markets have put in lockboxes? I believe California. I think Illinois has one. Do you know about some of the other top 10 states of yours? Tom Hill : Well, all of them have lockboxes. So all of that funding is protected and can't be diverted for other uses. So the funding is safe. And hopefully that funding will come back strong as we reopen up. But for now, any funding that's there is to be used only for highways. Rohit Seth : Okay. And then, today there's -- an unemployment report came out. It showed construction employment was down about 2.5 million jobs in April. Meanwhile, most of the companies reporting on construction this earnings season said April was not too bad. But the 2.5 million is an alarming number. Just curious, did you see -- are you seeing that? Are you hearing that? I mean, it took me by surprise -- Tom Hill : Yes. I think that is a national number and we did not see that kind of drop in our markets. I don't think we've seen that kind of drop in our markets in April. So I think it's more where that is. All these shelter in places have been different. For example, as we talked about the seven counties and around the Bay Area were restrictive on private. Well, Pennsylvania did not keep going with highway construction. As we know New York got hit harder. So some of the northeast probably got hit harder than most of our markets, got hit with this. So I just -- we didn't see those kind of drops in our markets. Rohit Seth : Okay. And then, just on liquid asphalt again. So as liquid asphalt does fall though, do you expect to realize the benefit? I know there's been about mixed responses on that in the past. Tom Hill : Yes. If history repeats itself, which we believe it will, as we saw the last couple of years, as mix went up we chased it. We've caught that now. So if you see a drop, we should -- you should see that benefit unit margins in asphalt. Rohit Seth : All right. So your asphalt business, given the highway is probably going to be the most resilient part of your business. I mean that should probably a pretty good business for you guys this year. Is that fair to say? Tom Hill : I would like most of this from a demand perspective, I would tell you. So far, so good. We think we're protected with highway demand for the next three or four months. After that hopefully the AASHTO will get what they need and it'll continue to grow as we move forward. Suzanne Wood : Yes. But, clearly, it's something we need to monitor. Tom Hill : Sure. Rohit Seth : All right. Great. Thank you. It's all I had. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The final question will come from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon. Suzanne Wood : Hi, Jerry. Tom Hill : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Battling connectivity issues this morning, so I apologize in advance if this has been asked. But can you talk about the pricing tools that you now have available heading into this downturn? And is there a way to quantify or better understand what they're going to allow you to do in this cycle compared to last one? So, obviously, not having cement helps in this downturn. But from pure aggregates standpoint, can you just talk about what the tools could potentially allow you to do here? Tom Hill : Yes. So the tools that we use, all give us visibility into that -- really into that 60% of the business that we're bidding that we talked about. And its real time that keeps up with our backlogs, our booking pace, what the prices in both of those look like, what sector the work is coming from, what size of the work is coming from. So you really have a real-time visibility and down deep into markets of the effective -- not only the effectiveness of our sales force and how they're doing on their disciplines, but also how the world should look going forward. And it just gives those management teams a lot better tools to predict, so that we can adjust our operations and our efforts accordingly. Jerry Revich : Yes. And Tom, in terms of what that'll drive from a market share standpoint, does that mean we should look for lower market share at the trough as you folks focus on -- you got more profitable jobs? Can you just flesh that out for me a bit, relative to the competitive landscape as well? Tom Hill : No. I wouldn't look at it that way. I think what it allows us to do is maximize our price and maximize our customer service to earn that price. So I wouldn't see a big market share swing in this. And you got to remember that is the beauty of the aggregates business, is the pricing characteristics that they are resilient. And we've seen this through multiple cycles. In fact, we've seen it for 40 years. I wouldn't think that this one would be any different. I think probably the industry, as a whole, is better off today than it was some 12 years ago. So I think the pricing disciplines, both within Vulcan and within the industry, are better today than they probably were 12 years ago, much less 20 years ago. Jerry Revich : And in terms of the metrics that you're managing, the individual 350 plant operators, can you talk about any changes in terms of the framework for evaluating their performance in a downturn compared to what it would have looked like a year ago? And how do we keep folks from -- who haven't seen this movie before, as the senior management team has, from getting up over those skis you have, from a cost structure standpoint? Tom Hill : Yes. Well, I think that we have a lot of experienced managers. We have a lot of new managers. I think that the -- again the operating piece of those four strategic initiatives of how do we run those operations the most efficiently and keep our people engaged to make sure we have appropriate training, so that you get that experience faster and further into the organization are very important and it will serve us very well through this. At the same time, we will look at all those leading indicators from our sales group to affect our operations as we look at critical sizes on those operations and adjust those accordingly. There's a lot of levers to pull in the operating side of the business, whether that's inventory or discretionary spending maximizing as we talked about those fundamentals of efficiencies. And I think that -- I know that our people are in a very good place here and they'll be able to handle swings in volume, as they would if it just marched up steadily. Jerry Revich : Appreciate the time. Thanks. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And with that, I'll hand the call back to Tom Hill for closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you. Thanks all of you for taking the time to listen to our call today. Clearly, these are very challenging times and they're challenging for all people throughout the world and for every business. So we greatly appreciate your interest and your support in Vulcan. Please stay healthy and we look forward to talking to you in the coming weeks and months and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call to John Kunz, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John Kunz : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to U.S. Concrete\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me on the call today is Ronnie Pruitt, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will make some prepared remarks, after which we will open the call to questions. As detailed on Page 2 of our accompanying presentation to facilitate today\u2019s discussion, today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to update or conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. For a list of these factors, please refer to the legal disclaimers and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC. Please note that you can find the reconciliations and other information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss on this call in the Form 8-K, which was filed earlier today. A presentation to facilitate today\u2019s discussion is available on the investor relations section of our website. Before I turn the call over to Ronnie to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and businesses results. Today, we are pleased to present our results for the second quarter. [The] volume disruptions that began in March continued into April, especially in the coastal markets we serve. These disruptions resulted in a significant reduction in revenue during the quarter. As the quarter progressed, we experienced a steady rebounded demand. We achieved substantially higher margins and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of aggressive cost containment, more efficient utilization of our plant and equipment, and the increased use of our proprietary technology. The improvement in our plant and equipment utilization and overall efficiency was achieved through the use of data analytics, greater use of \u2018where's my concrete technology\u2019, and reductions in cycle times. Our performance since the inception of the pandemic, including the strength of our second quarter results is a direct result of our team's rapidly response to this challenging environment and a testament to the strength of our business model. Our focus on building defensible vertically integrated market positions with an increasing concentration in aggregates helped us produce the robust second quarter results and demonstrates the strength of our business model during difficult times and market conditions. Our significant investments in aggregates, most notably Polaris and Coram led to record setting performance of our aggregates business in the second quarter. During the quarter, the impact of the pandemic, the related shelter in place requirements, and other restrictions were most acutely felt in our coastal regions. Even though we were deemed an essential business, many of our customer\u2019s projects were subject to disruptions and delays as the various shutdown orders were being rolled out and implemented. These restrictions impacted demand during the quarter resulting in revenue of $323 million, a 12% decrease, compared to the prior year second quarter. Despite the lower volume in revenue, our total adjusted EBITDA was $47.6 million, a 13.3% increase, compared to the $42.0 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.8% during the quarter versus 11.4% in the second quarter of 2019. This improvement was driven by both our aggregate and ready mixed operations. Our aggregates adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.6%, which was up 1,500 basis points versus the prior year, and our ready mixed adjusted EBITDA margin was 14%, which was an increase of 190 basis points, compared to the prior year. Our material margin was flat at 47.6% compared to the prior year quarter as we were able to recover modest material price increases. Our EBITDA adjustments for the quarter relate primarily to stock compensation, contingent consideration, realignment initiatives, and purchase accounting adjustments for Coram inventory. For 2020, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 27% and our interest expense to be in the $44 million to $47 million range. Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet, during the second quarter we generated $40.1 million of cash provided by operating activities more than double the $18.7 million in the prior year quarter. We generated $33.3 million of adjusted free cash flow during the second quarter, compared to $14.1 million in the prior year quarter. Our operating performance and cost containment efforts during the quarter contributed to this improvement. Our focus and effort with respect to working capital added $7.7 million to these results during the quarter. Our solid cash flow allowed us to pay down debt and reduced our net debt by $22 million as of June 30, compared to the March 31 quarter-end, resulting in $741.4 million of net debt at the end of the quarter. The increase in our trailing 12 months EBITDA, along with lower net debt position reduced our leverage at 3.9 times for about a quarter of return, compared to the March 31 leverage ratio.  As of June 30, we had total liquidity of $335 million, including $17.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $137.3 million of availability under our revolver, plus $180 million of availability under our delayed draw term loan. During the second quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $6.9 million in capital expenditures, compared to approximately $10.9 million for the same period last year. For the full-year 2020, given the improving business environment and the opportunity to allocate capital to both high return and high growth projects, we\u2019re planning for capital expenditures within a range of $30 million to $40 million, but we could reduce this amount if circumstances change. Similar to 2019, we are targeting free cash flow for the full-year to once again be above $100 million. While we had our share of challenges during the quarter, we are very pleased that our management team and employees rose to the challenge by controlling costs, and leveraging our technology, data analytics, and asset base, which led to our improved operating performance during the quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Ronnie. Ronnie Pruitt : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining the call. I know this continues to be a challenging time for many people. So first and foremost, I hope you're all staying healthy and safe. With the onset of COVID-19, we immediately committed ourselves to the following guidance of global healthcare leaders with a priority of taking care of our people and continuing to serve our customers. We continue to monitor government related mandates and commit to maintaining our focus on these important priorities. The second quarter of 2020 was a very dynamic environment due to the number of COVID cases across the country, and government imposed restrictions put in place that affected our business. We adjusted our operations on a daily basis to serve our customers and their projects that were deemed essential. We witnessed a direct correlation between the number of COVID cases in our markets, and the impact and timing of construction projects in those markets, most notably in New York and California. We witnessed a geographical shift in our revenue due to the operating restrictions in our markets with the West and East regions representing 30% of revenue during the quarter, and the central region comprising the balance of 40%. Turning to our performance, we generated $322.7 million of revenue during the second quarter of 2020, with revenue increasing from 29%, earned in April, 32% earned in May to 39% earned in June. Each month during the quarter, we saw sequential growth in construction activity across our markets as the definition of essential services evolved in each market and restrictions were modified. We are pleased to announce that U.S. concrete\u2019s aggregate operations had record setting quarterly revenue of $55 million with almost 3.2 million tons sold. Our adjusted EBITDA for aggregates operations was $22 million during the second quarter, with an adjusted EBITDA margin net of freight of 51%. Revenue production and EBITDA for our Texas aggregate operations were up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and we saw a significant increase in volume led by our Greenfield at MW Ranch, and the modernization of our plant and Mobile Equipment at our Amarillo sand and gravel operation. Both of these strategic investments supported robust construction activity in their regions during the quarter. Our aggregates segment performance was further enhanced by the first full quarter of Coram Materials, our sand and gravel operation on Long Island that we acquired in February. We are very pleased with the integration of Coram, the pull-through of volume to support our operations and the external sales to third party customers in the New York area. In addition to our internal consumption in our New York ready mixed operation, Coram shipped 217,000 tons to external customers during the quarter. As previously discussed, Coram is on target to achieve a post synergized multiple of 7x. Our ready mixed concrete segment delivered nearly 2 million cubic yards of concrete during the quarter, generating over $272 million of revenue and $38 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our ready mixed concrete ASP was up in each of our markets during the quarter, but on a consolidated basis was down slightly due to geographical and product mix. The employees at U.S. Concrete were diligently and efficiently to manage the business and implemented cost cutting measures all while actively re-engineering the business so that we could respond to the changes in each of our operating environments, our proprietary technology platform WheresMyConcrete and its CRM provided valuable real time data and analytics to respond to the changes in our business. During the second quarter, we generated an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.8% as compared to 11.4% in the second quarter of 2019. The key to delivering the improvement to our operating margins is two-fold. The variable nature of our cost structure for example, in the form of materials delivery labor and fuel, and the agility of our managers showed in each market by resizing and scaling their assets to mirror the market conditions. Our team continues to be focused on the following initiatives : labor management, improved processes, use of internally sourced aggregates, mixed optimization for our concrete, back office consolidation, higher asset utilization, management of plant cost, converting what were traditionally fixed expenses to the sum of variable, and delivery efficiencies with a focus on enhanced customer service and yards for driver hour, with our technology platform WheresMyConcrete. We also benefited from lower fuel cost and lower traffic volumes during the quarter. All of these measures are driving improvements to our cost structure and profitability. Our focus continues to be on operating margins and operating efficiencies. As restrictions were lifted during the quarter, our operating performance also improved as evidenced by our results, as June's performance was substantially better than April's.  In the future, where people live, how they commute to work and what a traditional work environment will be, either remotely or in an office setting, are all still unknown. These trends will impact the residential, commercial, and infrastructure markets that we serve. We're fully prepared to pivot within our markets to address changing demand patterns as exhibited by our second quarter performance. While further volatility and restrictions are clearly possible, and the pandemic's economic impact is still difficult to quantify. I am certain that all companies are evaluating their business and the changing landscape to assess future demand. Based on what we know today, our view is that business and construction restrictions will be limited, which should result in healthy activity levels in our markets resulting in an adjusted EBITDA anchored in the 50s for the third quarter. Looking forward into 2021, a detailed MSA analysis of construct connects U.S. Construction spend for the markets we serve projects a 17.5% increase in put in place commercial construction spending over 2020. Please refer to Slide 8 in our supplemental presentation provided. As a market leader, we participate in all sectors of the industry and have expertise with materials and mix designs and have the relationships, the plant locations, and the assets to support any type of construction project. We continue to support the very large complex projects that we have consistently discussed. It is also important to recognize that we have thousands of customers with thousands of diverse projects across our operating platform. This portfolio diversity highlights the capabilities and our versatility to handle dynamic market conditions and a wide variety of commercial and infrastructure projects in large markets with underlying favorable conditions.  We have the knowledge, ability, and agility to support the projects and in-markets for whatever drives aggregates and concrete demand, whether in residential, commercial, or infrastructure. With attractive and desirable locations, our markets represent over 20% of the U.S. population and are seeing increased population growth, with rates higher than the national average. Due to the proximity of infrastructure projects to our markets, U.S. Concrete has been and will be well-positioned to support these projects. We are even better positioned now to support infrastructure with our aggregates and distribution terminals located near many major markets. This confirms our strategic alignment of aggregates and concrete and attractive markets that are coordinated with our proprietary technology platforms, all of which will be a formidable foundation for any contemplated infrastructure bill. We continue to be laser focused on our strategy. We have diverse operating assets across major metropolitan regions in the United States and further diversified with our robust aggregates portfolio to provide vertical integration for our ready mixed assets, our focus is on maximizing our margins through cost management and operational efficiencies, and as exhibited by our second quarter financial results, we have a variable cost structure. Every employee U.S. Concrete is operating with a sense of purpose to deliver durable, long-term results for all of our stakeholders. We crossed an important operating milestone in U.S. Concrete\u2019s evolution as a company with our second quarter results. We have successfully proven that we can maintain and even improve our operating margins during times of pressure. We have significantly grown the impact of our aggregates business, which represented 36% of total reported segment adjusted EBITDA generated during the quarter.  We have improved our liquidity with the generation of free cash flow. We reduced our leverage to 3.9 times and we recognize stable and even improving pricing of our products during difficult market conditions over the quarter. We are a company focused on delivering aggregates, we are a company focused on delivering concrete, and we are a company focused on delivering results. If you noticed, I emphasize the word \u2018we\u2019. This is a team effort, and I want to thank all of our employees for their leadership and dedication. U.S. Concrete\u2019s financial results are tangible evidence of their hard work and efforts. Operator, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Paul Roger - Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Paul Roger : Hi, good afternoon from London, guys. Congratulations on the results. And as always, thanks for taking my questions. And I'll just start off with two of them, please. Obviously, the big story today, I guess is about the excellent margin performance. Now, clearly, demands will be whatever it is in the second half, but when we think about those margins, do you think they're sustainable and that's a realistic level that you'll get again in the second half? And then my second question is on the ready mixed pricing, looks like they fell, I think let's say about 5% sequentially in the quarter. Now, you've mentioned mix. So, is it possible to tell us what that was on a mix adjusted basis? And how concerned should we be about that? Obviously, the industry typically pricing historically has been quite volatile. Ronnie Pruitt : Yeah. Thanks, Paul. Good afternoon on your side of the pond. So, I'll take the first question on margin. So, I'll give you a couple of data points to think about. And I really want to talk about sequential quarter-over-quarter, so if you look at our Q1 volumes, we were right at around 2 million yards. Our volumes in Q2 were very similar right at about 2 million yards.  So, if I look at those comparable on the quarter-over-quarter, and then I\u2019d take, what I'm going to talk about is our total plant cost, which is really our labor and our repair and maintenance at our ready mixed operating facilities, as well as our total delivery cost, and when I look at those in a total dollar amount, quarter-over-quarter, our total plant cost was down a little over $4 million. On a percentage basis, if I look at our labor cost at our plants, they were down about 16%. Our repair and maintenance was down an additional 16%. You know, on the on the delivery side, we were down about $11 million in total on a Q-over-Q sequentially. If I take that and I really look at fuel, we had a tailwind on fuel. Obviously, everyone has talked about the tailwind on fuel, but fuel only made up about $2 million of that. And so when I think about the other things that go into our delivery cost, our delivery labor was down about 14%, our delivery R&M cost was down 23%. So those are things that we control. Those are decisions we made. And, you know, I just, I want to emphasize that fuel has been a tailwind. Traffic congestion continues to be a tailwind, but we're also really driving with the help of our technology and planning. And, you know, every dip manager out there watching the labor side to me is where we have the most control over that, and we will continue to focus on that. And I'll let John give you a little insight on the pricing side. John Kunz : So Paul, with respect to our ASP, the short answer to your question is on a mix adjusted basis, our ASP is actually up 1.3%. Now, if you think about that, just conceptually, you know, obviously, the Atlantic region was the hardest hit, they have one of the higher ASPs. So as that volume drops, that's going to have obviously pull down the ASP, but when you look across the regions, our regions and just do them individually, we're really up in every region. We really didn't see a decrease in the quarter for the region, but you know, 1.3% is what we saw on a mix adjusted basis. Paul Roger : Okay, that's good. And just going back to Ronnie's answer to the first question, and linking it to UseMyConcrete [sic] [WheresMyConcrete], what lines does UseMyConcrete [sic] [WheresMyConcrete] really help you address? Is it the delivery down logistics or is it labor? And what proportion of your network is actually using this tool now? Ronnie Pruitt : I think you referred to WheresMyConcrete? WheresMyConcrete is our\u2026 Paul Roger : Apology. Ronnie Pruitt : That\u2019s okay. We spend a lot of money getting that name right there, Paul. So, WheresMyConcrete, our entire Atlantic region is on it. In the first half of the year, we rolled out all of our DFW ready mix on it, and currently we're installing it in West Texas that our Ingram ready mix. The next phase of it will be rolled out into our California footprint. And so if you think about it on, we're a little over probably three quarters of the way done as far as the number of yards we're running through the system. The thing that the system allows us to do, it\u2019s our scheduling, it\u2019s scheduling of our customers orders, it\u2019s scheduling of our labor, it\u2019s scheduling of all of our delivery, and so when we think about the efficiencies we try to drive and using analytics to do that, it's getting out ahead of us and estimating the impacts of what would have historically taken eight trucks to serve a job now takes four trucks to serve a job, what would have historically taken, you know, 10 hours to serve a job is now taking 6 hours to serve a job.  So, the system's ability to predict that and be real time learning is critical to us. Because if we were going back in old way of doing business, we would have, you know, been estimating that on our own, and maybe it would have taken several weeks to estimate that and we didn't know traffic patterns, and we didn't know, you know, the things that really drive our efficiencies. And so that's what the technology allows us to do. On a real time basis, it's making adjustments to predict demand and predict traffic and printing labor needs, and so that's what we use it for to \u2013 it also schedules all of our in-bound materials. It adds a lot of functions to it, but from the most part, it's really a predictability model that we're trying to be more predictable with our needs and in managing those labor and assets. Paul Roger : That\u2019s really interesting. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Please go ahead. Kathryn Thompson : Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. Wanted to look more on the concrete side of your business, for margins on a go forward basis, how much of the efficiency \u2013 how much of the margin improvement in the quarter was really driven by efficiency or shortened drive times from lower traffic, but also the tools that you have internally versus cutting other variable costs, and you know along that with the other costs with labor, could you give more clarity in terms of changes you may have done on the labor front and including cutting back on guaranteed times, and what does that mean for the future? John Kunz : Yeah, good morning, Kathryn. Thank you. You know, going through some of the numbers I just talked about, and breaking those down even further, and, you know, at a high level, yes, we did reduce guaranteed hours in our in our non union footprint here in the Texas market. We implemented that early on in April. And I would tell you, you know, we've talked in the past about, you know, how that guaranteed hours was more in-line with our ability to attract consistent labor and you know, we talked about those pressures in the first quarter call, also in the fourth quarter of last year. You know, one of the things we have seen is those pressures on the labor lifted dramatically during this time. Our driver turnover is really a lot better during this time, but from a cost perspective, when we talked about our delivery labor costs being down 14% sequentially, again, I think there's a lot of that that has to do with our predictability, our managing of those driver labor hours. Now, does this traffic help that? It does. And I would say the most impacted markets on the congestion is definitely New York and San Francisco, but at the same time, you know, I've had comments as well, you know, those markets are never going to do this or never going to do that, but you're not going to be able to sustain those kind of efficiencies. I guess my only argument would be, you know, you can't argue that both ways. If they're never going to build another office building in New York then there's not going to be traffic back, if they are going to build those office buildings and there will be traffic back. One way or the other, I can either sustain in for a long time, and the market may shift, and like I've said, we've have the ability to pivot whether that's infrastructure, whether that's commercial, whether that's residential, whatever concrete demand is, we don't make the demand, but we will meet the demand, and you know, the \u2013 I think the most positive thing I've taken from these results is our ability of our managers to adapt to predicting what that labor needs are going to be, and really managing down to the daily needs of our labor. And so in a variable cost model, you know, we took cost off. Are some of those costs going to come back? You know, it just depends. There's a lot of factors out there that influence that, but I'm extremely pleased in where we're at. And I'm extremely pleased in our ability to continue to drive the margins that we delivered. Kathryn Thompson : So, it\u2019s fair to say that the \u2013 perhaps not all, but there is a decent portion of the margin upside that could be classified as a more structural change outside the kind of the labor element. John Kunz : Yes. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. John Kunz : Yeah, I think you look at, I mean, you've pointed it out in the past, as you look at the growth of U.S. Concrete, and the acquisitions that we've done over the last, you know, eight plus years, I mean, what that did give us the ability to do is manage assets. And so if you think about our ability to serve these major metropolitan areas, we have multiple assets in these big markets, that ultimately, we just, we can take a plant down. I mean, when we take a plant down, our labor cost at that plant goes to zero and we can serve the market. I mean, if there's less needs, I don't have to operate all my plants, and when I take that plant down, and I don't have any labor costs there, and really that's what we saw, especially coming out of April into May, and then as we opened those plants back up in June, obviously that labor cost is going to come back, but we're doing that in a way we're predicting the demand on that plant. And so we're are looking at this from an asset management standpoint as well, not just as a delivery company, but also as a production company that we operate these plants in many locations. Kathryn Thompson : Okay, it's helpful. Shifting to California, could you give us an update just between Northern and Southern California? Because the understanding that Southern California got back a little bit faster than Northern, where are you now just in terms of shelter-in-place routes and where are you in terms of not just volumes now, but kind of, what are you seeing in that activity trends in both of those markets? John Kunz : Yeah, so, you know, Southern California, obviously, we're just there with our Long Beach terminal and we supply that from Polaris. I would tell you that our business during the quarter was pretty steady in Southern California with less or \u2013 less interruptions because of the type of work that we are on there. We were more project specific deemed essential. So, we saw very little interruption in Southern California, but obviously a much smaller presence for us. And a lot less opportunity to disrupt because we don't have a wide variety of different projects like we are in Northern California. And Northern California, I think it was very similar to New York as far as the immediate impacts of early on with the restrictions that were put in place, and then as the market opened back up, and those restrictions were lifted, we saw the volumes recover pretty quick and pretty steady. I would tell you we're, you know, from a bidding perspective and pipeline in all the different analysis that we do, as far as how we look forward, in our demand side, we haven't seen a tremendous amount of shift, residential has been steady, we obviously have a lot of technology spend out there, that, you know, I think that's the thing in that market that is, it's tough to predict on a financial model, because there's a lot of liquidity out there.  So there's, I mean, we did a MEDPOR downtown San Francisco on an office mix use tower two weeks ago. And so it's not like, wow, you're just not seeing nothing, everything's come to an end. We're still seeing very good activity. We're still having a lot of interaction with our customers. And I think there's still a lot of, you know, a lot of blurriness and a crystal ball to say, you know, how far ahead of it are you willing to get? I think that's why we said we're confident in what we say for our third quarter and we'll re-evaluate as far as guidance looks after that. Kathryn Thompson : Okay, very helpful. And just final point, and once again, looking at a key geographic market for you for Texas. Your thoughts, you know that \u2013 in that market, you're a little bit more exposed to kind of private side. So, resi and non-res to some extent, what are you seeing in terms of trends in that market and what are your thoughts specifically on the resi end market in terms of debt activity? Thank you very much. Ronnie Pruitt : Yeah, thank you. Yeah, as far as Texas goes, we've seen the resi side pretty much just stay really consistent. I would say the most impact was early on and some of that impact was mixed with both COVID and weather, and so we had some early on weather and so it was really hard to distinguish on the resi side because a lot of the customers we have told us that all the houses that were under construction, were going to continue and they initially were not going to start any new and then that got flipped pretty quick. So, we've seen very consistent results on the resi side. On the non-resi side, I think we continue to see the same trends. We have not really seen anything, as far as the word major cancellations. We've seen words like delay, words like pushed out, but we're also seeing jobs that are bidding on a daily and weekly basis. And so, you know, I think that's going to be the piece to me that we're in the right markets, and so where the people are matters. When you look at per capita consumption and that equation is based on where population is. And so, I would much rather be where I'm at today than in the middle of nowhere, hoping that they're going to build something and my ability to pivot again, whether that's infrastructure, whether that's commercial or whether that is residential is extremely easy for me, extremely easy. I mean, the assets are in the right place, we've got the expertise. So, whatever the demand is, we're in a position to meet. Kathryn Thompson : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please go ahead. Trey Grooms : Hey, good morning. John Kunz : Hi Trey. Trey Grooms : And congrats on the quarter. Nice work, especially on the margins. And I know that's been touched on quite a bit, but the on the aggregate side, it seems like a lot of the things we\u2019re talking about was on the ready mix side, but on aggregates, massive increase there in the gross margin. Can you talk a little bit more about that specifically on the aggregate side and how much of that is due to Coram coming on, you know, and how much of that is more just kind of structural changes that you've made, there would be my first question? John Kunz : Yeah, Trey. I think definitely a benefit from Coram. Definitely continued benefit from Polaris and also, you know as I called out MW Ranch, our Greenfield investment that was really fully online in the first of the year, but really maximizing that through the quarter was also you know, a very big toe in-force on the margin side. You know, I guess the way I would look at it Trey and when we talk about net of freight 51% margins on our aggregate side. You know, I think the lack of credit we get is people look at sand and gravel as kind of a stepchild to hard rock. Hard rock is good, hard rock is necessary. We have hard rock quarries in New Jersey, but if you look at a yard of concrete, there's also fine aggregates needed. In every single yard, there's fine aggregates needed and when you look at the operations I have today with Coram within MW Ranch, with Rainbow, with Red River, with Chatfield, with Polaris, and I\u2019d go on down the list of sand and gravel plants that I have. My cost structure, there is just so much different. I don't have drill and blasting. I have very, very little quarry cost. It's extremely efficient, and how we mine the sand. And if you look at the ASPs for our aggregates, I mean, they're just really steady. And so as we continue to put those improvements in our operations we continue to invest in a mobile equipment that also has a really good payback for our efficiencies. I just think we're in a really good position with our aggregate strategy, and what we've done, and we talked about from a location matters and so everything we've done has been coordinated around our pull-through strategy. And so what we did at Polaris is the exact same thing we talked about at Coram and Coram is another example that we buy it, we integrate it, and we can pull through and control it. We did the hard work on the downstream assets. Once you have the downstream assets, the rest of the work is a lot, lot easier. And that's the story we continue to try to tell. And I think that's the story that we continue to not get credit for. So hopefully, you know these results we can continue to deliver. And, you know, people will give us credit for what we've done in aggregate. It's a tough business, but I believe we're in the right place with the right locations, and definitely have the right operating teams and I'm very proud of what our teams did. Trey Grooms : And seeing, you know aggregates now 36% of EBITDA in the quarter is definitely worth noting. And I guess to follow-up still just kind of sticking with aggregates just for a second, you know, Coram you closed on that and then, you know, right out of the gate you had, you know, COVID hit. So, I don't, clearly I don't think we've seen, you know, its full potential. So, how are you thinking about that aggregate mix, you know, as a portion of your total EBITDA as we go forward? Ronnie Pruitt : I think that 36% as, you know, as we see the interruptions in COVID, it interrupted both sides. So it did interrupt the concrete side, too. So, as we've continued to see the markets, month-over-month sequentially improve, we've continued to see both sides of it improve. I would tell you on a, you know on a margin side and an EBITDA side, obviously the aggregates is going to have a much greater influence. You know, on a revenue side, the Coram is a lot of FOB sales and so it's really, really clean operation that has just a lot of FOB customers. You know, the other side of that is that, you know, one of the benefits of being vertically integrated in that market is just the visibility it gives us into the entire market. It's just a really good fit for us with a pure pull-through into that New York market. So, it not only supports our own internal operations, but we have a lot of really good third party customers there that are also diversified in other markets there, and so it really diversifies us in all those other markets in residential and smaller commercial stuff and in infrastructure as well. So, I think it gives us a better cushion around any volatility in the New York market as well. Trey Grooms : Got it. And then switching gears to the, you had a little bit of commentary around 3Q, just to make sure I heard you right, it sounded like adjusted EBITDA in the 50s range. I was having some technical difficulties and it was breaking up around that time, I want to make sure I heard that right first off? And secondly, if you can maybe give a little bit more color about, you know, kind of what you're what you're seeing that drives you to that number and, you know, kind of what's your saying that grabs you to that number and you know, kind of what\u2019s backed into that, I guess? Ronnie Pruitt : Yeah, Trey, you did hear, we should have anchored in the 50s. And so we're trying to get a little range there. And I will tell you what we see and what gives us confidence in that is; one, on the margin side durability side, the things I've talked about the things we've put in place to manage this business through the pressures that we see; and two, the continued sequential month-over-month-over-month improvements. And so I think we're far enough into the Q3 that we can have that visibility, and I think we're going to be really patient around getting too far out ahead of that.  I can tell you that we're confident in our ability to manage the business, and we're not trying to get out and predict the demand side, but we will absolutely maximize our assets and absolutely be in a position that whatever drives concrete demand and aggregate demand that we can meet that demand. Trey Grooms : Understood. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Hi, good morning everybody. Congratulations on a nice quarter. I apologize if you mentioned this, I have been juggling a bunch of calls this morning, did you guys provide any commentary on Trent in July? I heard the 50 million plus for EBITDA, but I was just curious kind of, if you had said anything about July? John Kunz : No, we did not. I think Stanley what we have said is, we just continue to see sequential improvements in our business. So, as markets have stabilized and opened back up, we continue to see the same trends that we did, as I gave you the example of the difference in April, the difference in May, the difference in June, we've continued to see just a small steady increase in how the markets look more stable as we've gotten into July. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. Did you guys provide any contribution from acquisitions in the quarter in terms of that nice ramp on the aggregates piece? Ronnie Pruitt : Now, I mean, we called out kind of, what the external influence on Coram was, and we called out where we believe Coram is exactly in-line with where we had originally said. Even through COVID, even through the timing of announcing that at the end of February and all the difficulties that everybody said we were going to have, we were absolutely on pace on a post-synergy of 7x multiple in that acquisition, so you can model that however you would like, but I think that absolutely we\u2019re confident in that. Stanley Elliott : And lastly, you did just a nice job on the cost side, in delivery cost. Is it pretty well split between kind of your union and non-union markets? Just curious kind of how those costs trended, and if there were any different between those two? John Kunz : Yeah, I would tell you using from a modeling perspective, what we said was there was a shift regionally from 30% of our revenues came in the east, 30% west, and 40% in our central. So, I would say from a volume perspective, cost perspective, those kind of things. That's a pretty good model to use. Obviously, there's some higher labor costs on our union contracts and things like that, but I think, if you use that kind of model in the quarter, most of that will wash out. Stanley Elliott : Perfect guys. Thanks for the time appreciate it. Best of luck. Ronnie Pruitt : Thank you, Stanley. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead. Adam Thalhimer : Very good morning guys. Congrats. John Kunz : Hey, Adam. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, I'm just curious, like on the visibility front, I know a couple months ago, you know, it\u2019s hard to have faith and kind of your concrete schedules, just with client\u2019s kind of moving things around during the pandemic, has that improved at all just your disability in general? Ronnie Pruitt : I think our visibility from a standpoint of, you know, we have a CRM system that we use that we've \u2013 is part of our WheresMyConcrete technology that we developed. In the CRM, we've actually rolled that out everywhere. We put the CRM in place ahead of dispatching technology and what the CRM does is it allows us to be way more specific down to the customer level. So, we track a lot of things on customer trends, because at the end of the day, our customers are the ones that we see the biggest impact as far as inflows and outflows of jobs. And so when we really start predicting year-over-year customer trends, I mean, I think we have a real pretty good visibility into where they're at and if there's shifts in the market because we have customers segmented in residential, customers segmented in commercial, and customer segment in infrastructure. So I, you know, we're just trying to get so far away from the typical backlog that people talk about, because backlog to us was Stone Age, and people that still want to talk about backlog, there's a lot more data out there that we can use and we think we can be smarter around planning our asset, planning our labor, planning our investment, planning our CapEx, playing those things around, more visibility into what forward looking things are going to look like. And so, I would tell you again, I mean, we what we are going to be disciplined in is our pricing side. We do not \u2013 we did not create demand on our product with pricing. It never has and it never will. So whatever demand is going to look like, we're prepared to supply that, but I would say you know in the construct connect information we gave you, even if you think about the way a lot of whether it's construct connect, whether it\u2019s \u2013 a lot of these guys are reporting, you know, we're always going to be a lag because a lot of those projects get reported right up front. And then we may be pouring on the job three, four, five more months, but we're also a lag on the front-end. So, you know, it kind of balances out, but I would tell you, you know, I think from our perspective, we feel good on continuing to see the sequential improvements that we've seen, you know, really starting from mid-May when a lot of the restrictions were lifted. Adam Thalhimer : Yeah. Okay. That's my key point. Like, as the restrictions were lifted, how would you characterize kind of customer behavior? I mean, as we sit here in July, are you seeing customers saying, and you alluded to this in San Francisco, but saying, hey, rates are low. I got to move on this stuff? Ronnie Pruitt : Yeah, I think it's been a combination of both. I think some of them were more impacted by restrictions depending on what type of work they were. So some of them immediately started back to work on jobs that they already had. And they hit the ground running. I mean, it was full speed ahead, you know, the hole was already dug, whatever dirt work was done. And then we've seen a certain amount of customers that said, you know, we don't know what's going to happen. And then two weeks later, you know, jobs came back, if they thought we're going to be delayed for a long time. And so there's market-by-market, segment-by-segment residential has been very consistent. And I wouldn't say, you know, I don't want to use the words of, you know, records or blah, blah, blah, but it's been very consistent. And I think that's the ability for us to continue to push, the efficiencies that we've built-in and controlling our cost is, it's a consistent model that we can get ahead of and really manage that labor, as well as, you know the [R&M] and the things like that, that we said we control during the quarter. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. And then just from a sense of like, your guys on the ground, the activity they're seeing, the bids they're seeing, maybe the easiest thing to do would just be kind of, you know, rank your big geographies New York, San Fran, Dallas, kind of, you know, where you feel the most confident the next kind of 6 to 12 months and maybe where you feel the least? Ronnie Pruitt : Yeah, I would say from a confidence standpoint, we've talked about it in the past, Texas is very diverse. Texas has a lot of growth. Texas has a lot of land and affordability is obviously a big piece of that. And so I think, you know, Texas is one that probably can pivot the most to whatever demand there is and whatever economic factors influences it. I would say from a standpoint of both New York and San Francisco and New Jersey and D.C., and Philadelphia, that, I mean, the positive thing is there's so much infrastructure demand, and it's not infrastructure from a standpoint of, you know, how we're going to pay for, what's it going to be bah, bah, bah, there's a lot of that political stuff that's going to still happen. From a demand perspective, those markets have been starved for infrastructure dollars, and you know, when you think about our footprint, I mean, it's where the infrastructure dollars are needed. And I don't care if we talk about well, there's going to be a transition out to the suburbs from the city. We can reach the suburbs. We're in Westchester. We're in New Jersey. We can reach those markets. And it's not like oh, well, everything leaves that city. And you're done there. Now, we can pivot and go to the suburbs too and we've got really good assets to fit that, and so I'm confident in all of our markets, all of them will look different. All of them are going to have different demand drivers. And again, I think location matters and where people are matters, and I just feel very confident and we pick and pick the right locations, because population and per capita is a very big driver of what concrete and aggregate demand is. Adam Thalhimer : Okay, great. Okay, great. Thank you, Ronnie. Ronnie Pruitt : Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Brendan on for Larry. Just wanted to ask about looking at the aggregates margins year-over-year, how much, could you speak to how much Coram attributed to that benefit? John Kunz : We don't break out Coram. I would tell you Coram\u2019s aggregate results are similar to our other sand and gravel results. I mean, I think they were all very good from a production side. They were all very good from a sales price being consistent and movement on that. And so, you know, looking at Coram, it's just another really good aggregate play for us that has really, really good pull-through and obviously as we put more volume through it, those margins are going to just improve. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just looking at your pipeline, you talked about some that you've seen steady fairly quickly, looking beyond, I guess [the price] you're working on now, I mean, how are customers approaching, you know, feature large projects, you know, are you having similar amounts of conversations with customers about that stuff that's I guess, not necessarily backlog, but potential looking more out like potential backlog? Are people just kind of sitting and waiting, are you still having those projects conversations? Ronnie Pruitt : No. We're having lots of project conversations and the same amount of planning that goes into these complex projects are still haven't changed even though those maybe virtual planning meetings now, instead of in-person, the planning still goes into that. And I would tell you that, I think our customers are taking the same approach we are \u2013 they're pleasantly surprised by the amount of work that's come back and they're being cautiously optimistic about what's to come. They have their relationships just like we have our relationships with developers, with owners, with key projects, and I think so depending on which segment you're in, and which markets you're in. Those customers levels of confidence are going to vary, but I would say overall, the tone is pretty positive. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you. Ronnie Pruitt : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Zane Karimi with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Zane Karimi : Hey, good morning guys. Congrats on the quarter and hope everyone is staying healthy and well. John Kunz : Thanks, Zane. Zane Karimi : So, first off, I think was off of Katherine's question earlier, but to what degree have you guys been able to \u2013 employees back to job sites in New York City in the Bay Area, and how much of a recovery should we assume [into 3Q]? Ronnie Pruitt : So, as far as job sites and restrictions, we have no restrictions as far as government imposed or local restrictions on job sites in New York or in San Francisco. So, the restrictions have been lifted. I mean, we have a lot of safety things we're doing with our own internal employees, and then we have safety things that are also being done by our customers on job sites. So, there's a lot of, you know, things that we're doing from a safety perspective, but as far as restrictions as far as being on jobs, we don't have any of those right now on either market. So, I would say that from a natural progression of the jobs we're covering, it's just all about now the customers and the job and what our ability is to actually start those jobs back. So, it's nothing that is from a governance perspective being restricted. Zane Karimi : Thank you. Then, how much longer can you guys sustain CapEx at these levels? I think it was below DD&A and can you remind of the true maintenance CapEx run rate? John Kunz : Yeah, so, for our CapEx, you know that 30 million to 40 million range isn't too far below our depreciation, as you refer to that, there is depletion and amortization in there as well. So, the depreciation there was by \u2013 in the mid-60s, so our forecast is a little bit lower than that. We think that we can sustain it, and obviously for the remainder of the year and then as we go on to next year, it will evaluate how we think about it, but we do want to allocate capital to the high growth, high return projects going forward. So, it's something that certainly can be managed. Zane Karimi : Okay, well, thank you guys very much. Ronnie Pruitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Julio Romero : Hey, good morning. Hope you all are well. John Kunz : Thanks, Julio. Julio Romero : Guess my first question is on ready mixed pricing, John I appreciate you calling out the mix adjusted price being up 1.3% on the quarter, can you just talk about pricing trends you're maybe seeing today, and you know are your geographic markets still holding price on a standalone year-over-year basis? John Kunz : Yeah, I would. I would tell you, what we're seeing today is, very little pressure on pricing, very little pressure on what a normal economic downturn would look like. You know, and I think as you think about that, Julio, the markets have changed. I mean, we did a lot of consolidation. There's been other consolidation to help and there's been a focus over the past, you know, 8 to 10 years ever since Bill started the strategy of ruling up a lot of these assets that the investment community to \u2013 all sides of it hammered on us about how the importance of pricing was. And so when you look at the PPI, and you can go back over the last five years, and you can look at it currently, ready mix pricing is holding really well, really strong. And you know, there is a very, very strong correlation between ready mixed pricing and aggregate pricing and cement pricing. And I've told you in the past, and I'll reiterate it, I'm in a position that I'm not trying to beat up suppliers every day. I've told you, I'm not going to give up material margins and I'm not willing to give up material margins, but I'm going to support those increases. I'm in the aggregate business, I don't do any good trying to find one source of beating someone up and then it all gets given away, and so, you know, our role as a leader in our markets has continued to do the things we do. And pricing being stable is one of the things we\u2019ve said in the past, that was our focus, and it's going to continue to be a focus. And I'm not saying there won\u2019t be ups and downs, but strategically with the systems we have, the analytics we're using, with our CRM tool, with our WMC tool we're going to make the right decisions from a profitability standpoint with pricing. And if we have to walk away, we walk away, but we're just not, again, we're not going to create concrete demand with the price of concrete. Julio Romero : Thank you. I appreciate the caller. And I guess that dovetails into just my follow up question is, you know, you do have some healthy share in the Northeast of California and you've got some defensible positions in those markets, have you, I mean, do you think you maybe have gained any share or seen any broader changes in the competitive landscape, just given the volatility in the quarter in those markets? Thank you? Ronnie Pruitt : Yeah, I don't think in the quarter, and I think because of the restrictions because of the type of work because of the choppiness and how those jobs opened back up, and we're down, that there was really, really hard to get visibility into what market share was because it just really depended on what job you had going into it and how that job was affected. So, I think it's too early to say, you know, you're going to go out and really think that someone gave up or took market share. As the market stabilizes, and as we continue to see consistency in the markets, we evaluate that normally. It's not something we overreact to because it can ebb and flow with large projects and if you lose a large project for whatever reason or you get a large project for whatever reason, you know, your market share could really take a big jump. It's not something that I measure from a standpoint of being aggressive or being more on the pricing side because it's just too many moving parts. Julio Romero : Understood. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. John Kunz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call to Ronnie Pruitt for his final remarks. Ronnie Pruitt : Thank you. [Cameron]. From all of us at U.S. Concrete, thank you for joining our second quarter call.

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I hope that you and your families are continued stay safe and healthy. Today, I'm going to discuss our record setting results for the quarter and in share perspective on how the evolving construction environment is shaping longer term demand for our products. Building on our excellent second quarter results, we continue this momentum into the third quarter with record setting financial performance. As we will detail today, we believe our business is well positioned to continue to deliver strong financial results, both in the near and long-term. The transformation we've undertaken over the past several years to reshape our portfolio, and capabilities for growth and improve margins have proven critical in enabling us to respond to the changing dynamics in the current environment. Our diverse portfolio, commitment to innovate an agile culture has allowed us to respond to the construction demand in the markets that we serve, and position us to deliver meaningful financial results into the future. Our performance reflects the great work our team has accomplished during these challenging times. In particular, I want to commend the hard working U.S. Concrete team members within all of our operating regions. Their extraordinary efforts in keeping safe, while simultaneously focusing on our operating performances have made it possible for us to continue to meet the demands of our communities, customers and projects, and I could not be more proud of them. Shifting to the business, we generated $374.2 million of revenue during the third quarter of 2020, as referenced on Slide 3 in our earnings presentation. On a consolidated basis, we saw geographical shift to more normal levels, with each region representing 34% of total revenues for the quarter. The central region was 35% and 31% in the West region, where results were impacted by a constrained cement supply in Northern California.  During the quarter, we recorded sequential increases over the second quarter in segments and total sales, as well as increases in segment and total adjusted EBITDA. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins were 17.1% for the third quarter as we continue to drive significant margin growth in each of our operating segments. Our execution in the quarter enable us to exceed our EBITDA expectations. This is in large part due to aggressive management of expenses, asset utilization and process reengineering of our existing platform, as well as gains from our acquisition of Coram earlier this year. We are pleased to announce the U.S. Concrete aggregate operations had record setting quarterly revenue of $64 million, which is a 20% increase over last year's third quarter with almost 3.7 million tons sold. Our adjusted EBITDA for aggregates operations was $27 million during the third quarter, as we spend it our adjusted EBITDA margin, net of freight to 54% as compared to 42% for last year's third quarter. Continuing the trend from our second quarter, our aggregate segment generated 37% of total reported segment adjusted EBITDA revenue, volume and EBITDA for aggregate operations were up in virtually every market year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as we saw strong demand for our product and a significant increase in production. We continue to increase the internal consumption of aggregates, which increased to 41% on an LTM basis through September. Our financial performance for our aggregate segment set historical records during the quarter for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins. Strengthening our aggregate portfolio and our operations has been an area of focus for us and we're seeing the fruits of our labor. Our ready mix concrete segment delivered 2.2 million cubic yards of concrete during the quarter, generating $313 million of revenue, and $46 million of adjusted EBITDA. Benefiting from the markets in which we operate, our consolidated ready mix concrete Asia-Pacific was up sequentially over the second quarter, and up over the third quarter of 2019. Even with the fluctuations in volume across many of our markets our ready mix operating teams delivered solid adjusted EBITDA margins of 14.7%, which is 20 basis points higher than last year's third quarter, and up from 14% for the second quarter of 2020. Our robust performance has also helped us to delever at a faster pace. As John will outline later, our net leverage ratio decreased to 3.65 times at September 30 due to adjusted the free cash flow generated during the quarter. Maintaining reasonable leverage metrics across the cycle is a strategic goal of ours and we are proud of the growth of our company over the past decade. Taking advantage of an attractive interest rate environment, we refinanced $400 million of our senior unsecured notes in September, which reduced our annual interest expense by 1.25% or $5 million annually. We are committed to long-term growth, which requires strategically investing in our operations, because we remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business. Even during these challenging times and we remain committed to delivering innovation to our customers and their projects. Our growth is rooted in innovation with strategic acquisitions that complement our historical operating portfolio. And we are driving transformation and efficiencies in our business as discussed in detail during our second quarter call. For example, we've applied the proven strategy to Coram, the sand and gravel operation we acquired back in February of this year. To fillers as we continue to pursue the BlackBerry expansion to the back office consolidation efforts of our business, as well as gaining efficiencies with dispatching of concrete with Where's my concrete, our proprietary technology application.  Our National Research Laboratory was also highlighted this August in a New York Times article about industry innovation, and the adoption of our technology such as carbon cure for producing low emission concrete with a reduced carbon footprint.  I would now like to turn the call over to John for additional financial commentary. John Kunz : Thanks Ronnie. As mentioned, we are very pleased with our record setting financial performance. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $63.9 million, the highest we have ever reported for any quarter, compared to $62 million in the prior year quarter. Our aggregates and ready mix business continue to show their resiliency during the quarter as demonstrated by their outstanding results in light of the economic climate. Our aggregate volumes were up 17.6% compared to the prior year third quarter, driven primarily by the addition of Coram with our base aggregates business up marginally.  Ready mix volume was off 13.2%, compared to the prior year third quarter, with each of our regions experiencing some reduced levels of demand, our consolidated revenue for the quarter was $374 million and 8.5% decline compared to the prior year third quarter. Our cost containment efforts continue to result in adjusted EBITDA margin improvement for both businesses. With aggregates adjusted EBITDA margins improving to 42.1% led by Coram and Polaris and ready mix adjusted EBITDA margins improving to 14.7%. These improvements resulted in a consolidated EBITDA margin of 17.1% for the quarter. We were able to achieve higher margins through continued cost containment actions, more efficient utilization of our plants and equipment and the increasing use of technology based data driven decision making. Our material margin increased by 90 basis points to 48.4%, compared to the prior year quarter. Our EBITDA adjustments for the quarter relate primarily to stock compensation, contingent consideration of pension liability settlement, realignment initiatives and purchase accounting adjustments for Coram inventory. Our SG&A was 8.6% of revenue for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 7.8% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted SG&A excluding stock compensation, acquisition related costs and realignment initiatives was 7.3% of revenue in the third quarter, compared to 6.3% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our cost control efforts offset by higher incentive compensation expense, and the impact of lower revenue. Based on the company's strong performance in 2020, it is expected that incentive compensation will be earned at levels above the nominal amounts awarded in 2019, resulting in higher expense during the quarter. We recognized 10.2 million of tax benefits in the quarter relating to the finalization of the interest limitation provisions contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the net operating loss carry back provisions of the CARES Act. For 2020, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 27% and our interest expense to be in the $44 million to $46 million range. As a result of our September notes offering, we expect to see a reduction in our quarterly interest expense of approximately $1.3 million or $5 million annually on a perspective run rate basis. However, in Q4, our expense will include one-time cost of approximately $12.5 million of fees and unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the October redemption, which are not included in the previously mentioned full year range. Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. During the third quarter, we generated $61.3 million of cash provided by our operating activities, $9.8 million more than in the prior year quarter. We generated $58.6 million of adjusted free cash flow during the third quarter, compared to $41.5 million in the prior year quarter. Our operating performance and cost containment efforts during the quarter contributed to this improvement.  Our working capital management activities at $1.2 million to these results during the quarter. For the nine months period, our free cash flow was $129 million, exceeding our 12-month target of $100 million. Our cash flow performance allowed us to reduce our net debt position by $44.1 million as of September 30, compared to the June quarter end, resulting in $697.3 million of net debt at the end of the quarter. The increase in our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA along with lower net debt position reduced our leverage to 3.65 times or about a quarter turn compared to our June 30 leverage ratio. We are also very proud to report that we have reduced our leverage by half a turn in the six months since the completion of our acquisition of Coram and are back at levels close to where we ended the year. As of September 30, we had total liquidity of $826 million, including $406 million of cash and cash equivalents, $240 million of availability under our revolver plus $179.6 million of availability under our delayed draw term loan. Our liquidity includes $413 million, which was used to pay principal and redemption premiums on our six and three eight nodes in early October. During the third quarter, we invested approximately $3.3 million in capital expenditures compared to $10.5 million for the same period last year. For the full year 2020, we are planning for capital expenditures around $30 million. While we continue to manage through these challenging times, we are very pleased with our record results. These results would not be possible without the dedication and effort of our employees and management team to control costs and leverage our technology to improve the operating efficiency of business, leading to outstanding performance in this challenging environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Ronnie. Ronnie Pruitt : Thanks, John. I'd now like to address our perspective on the evolving environment and what we see going forward. While we hope the most acute and severe impact of COVID-19 is behind us. We believe that recent shifts in behavior coupled with macroeconomic trends suggest the residential, commercial, and even the infrastructure markets will be evolving with the changing work and lifestyle trends. During the third quarter, we observed a 6% shift from commercial work to residential work, respectively representing 55% and 27% of our total projects, with infrastructure capturing the balance of 18%. We continue to monitor the efforts in Washington with respect to the federal infrastructure bill, and are also hopeful that one will be passed by Congress. We believe the U.S. Concrete is uniquely positioned in the markets that we serve, to benefit from any infrastructure bill and from these work and life style shifts, including the current shift to suburban markets due to our geographical footprint, our portfolio of aggregates and ready mix assets, our experience, our relationships and ability to support the technical standard of the sometimes complex projects. While we we\u2019re pleased with our recent performance, we want to emphasize that our focus is on the future market conditions, opportunities and strategies that are required to optimize performance and shareholder value. Fortunately, the markets we serve provide some natural diversification and hedge on market specific issues. Naturally, Texas and New York and New Jersey metropolitan area all have different market fundamentals. Even San Francisco has different attributes when compared to San Jose. Like many other companies, we are consistently analyzing all data, feedback, and information so that we can best assess what is the new normal, especially in our urban markets as you know, opinions vary greatly. And we also must be cognizant of the prior to the pandemic of the U.S. economy was well into its near 10-year expansion. At this point, we are cautiously optimistic regarding next year's conditions in each of our markets. Although we do not believe it is possible to offer specific quantifiable judgments for volume of activities. What we are confident in, however, is that based on our success, in the past two quarters of unprecedented uncertainty in our country, our team will be able to manage the business effectively and profitably in a range of future scenarios. Our team has proven its ability to adapt to a variety of scenarios in a rapidly changing environment. We continue to see long term demand for aggregates and concrete and we will continue to invest in our platform. Our proprietary system Where\u2019s my concrete empowers us to make informed decisions using data, interact with our customers and gain insights into and manage our pipeline with a CRM. The major lesson for us for 2020 is that significant percentages of our expenses are variable, or highly variable. We built our company to take up costs during changes in an economic cycle. Our results and margins over the past two quarters support this thesis and we believe it is an important dynamic in evaluating our business model. Based on the normal seasonality our industry experiences in the fourth quarter, we're projecting our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between $40 million and $45 million with full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA between $186 million and $191 million, which would post ahead of the $184 million generated in 2019. As discussed last quarter, every employee U.S. Concrete is operating with a sense of purpose to deliver durable, long-term results for all of our stakeholders. We set many new financial records during the quarter, which include record aggregate revenue, record average adjusted EBITDA, record total adjusted EBITDA and record adjusted free cash flow generated. We have communicated over the last several quarters that we are focused on managing our operating margins and the results we have reported today highlight that promise and our performance. We're also pleased to announce a virtual Investor Day with a presentation and conference call that scheduled for Thursday morning, November the 12. We look forward to your participation during that call. And hope to form allows for fresh insights into the company, our financial performance, our management team, and strategies. With that operator, I would like to open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes in Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Your line is now open Kathryn Thompson : My first focusing on the aggregate segment. What were the primary components for the margin that side? In particular, how much was driven by lower energy costs versus other structural changes? Really what we're trying to get through is understanding perhaps more one-time and what is more sustainable going forward? RonniePruitt: I think Coram was obviously a very big benefit until we're in the margins. When I think about what's sustainable and what's one-time. I think we have lots of benefits around our operating procedures, especially in when we think about Coram, it's a very simple process, it's a very easy mining operation. Very similar to Polaris in a way that sand and gravel, it's a low cost way that we would produce those products. So I think those operating probably things that we put in is very sustainable. Pricing has also been a lift on that. And I think we're just at the front end of what we think our pricing strategies could be both on the West and East Coast. And then I'll layer that in with the investments we've made in the central side with MW Ranch and MW Ranch has been really our first full two quarters back to back of operating. So we're still working out the budget, that plant. But that's seen significant improvements in margin as well. So like I said in my prepared remarks, I think all three regions central East and West contributed to that. And so it's not just one area that we said we just picked up in this one place. So I think those things are very sustainable. Kathryn Thompson : Understanding that California was disrupted by fires and there's a cement shortage in the state due to a bit one point time to plants being down or unable to serve the market. Could you quantify the impact of the California fires to results. And even if it's just high level looking at what the top-line impact is, but just the cost of operating? And is that demand just pushed out? And where are you today? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes, great question. I think the demand is pushed out. The fires were definitely an impact with rolling power interruptions. But the bigger interruption was the lack of cement supply, which was really, from one of the plants being shut down permanently. And the reaction to that is going to be more imports and those imports to take time. I do think over the next quarter, we'll see a more consistent supply on the cement side, which, again, I think will help us. On the cost side, I don't, other than the unpredictability of that and pushing out the demand side. And so we saw some daily interruptions in cement supply. I don't think, it was a big issue on the cost. But I do think on the demand side, and when we said to more normalized, distribution of our revenue by region in the West Coast was still impacted by that. So we said, 31%, I think more normally, we would see a pretty even split of our revenue by region. So I think there is some recovery that we have to do. And I do think those volumes will be pushed into the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year. Kathryn Thompson : And final questions before I hop back in the queue and thank you for answering my questions today. It's just high level, when you look at the year-to-date, having the impact of the pandemic on major markets and you think about in New York, Texas and California. Where do you see, and they are unable to give specific for guidance. But what's the net impact you see to those three regions? As you look over, not just next year, but say over the next 12 to 24 months? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes, great question and we look forward to giving some more insight into that in our Investor Day presentation. But I would say 12 to 24 months out each region specifically. I think infrastructure plays a big role in all three regions. I think of all the regions that have lacked infrastructure, the Northeast is one that's probably been the most dramatic, over the last four to five years of lack of infrastructure spin. Obviously, in Texas, we're seeing a lot of residential and a lot of shift to residential. But we're also seeing infrastructure spend continue. And so I think Texas has been more of a balanced market. And then with the cement shortages in Northern California has been some impacts. But we've also seen shifts there as well, on the residential side and that's where, when I talk about that natural hedge of all of our markets, having different drivers and our ability to pivot within those markets. And I even called out that even in one quarter we saw a shift from commercial to residential of about 6% difference. And so again, as I talked about on the second quarter, and I want to reinforce. We're a concrete supplier and an aggregate supplier. And at the end of the day, whatever the market demand is, we're going to meet that market demand and whether that comes in residential, whether that comes in infrastructure, whether that's in commercial. We're here to service the market, we're here to service our customers, and we're going to service whatever those demands are. And so, I think, I like our footprint still like where we're at, and we're able to pivot to whatever that domain would be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Roger with Exane. Your line is now open. Paul Roger : Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So obviously next week is a big week deal action. And this is difficult to know how it's going to span out. And do you have a view on what the different outcomes could mean for U.S. Concrete in the industry whether it's President Trump and President Biden. And irrespective of who wins next week and if we get a highway sale? Is there a risk anyway that you have this sort of ad hoc hit in early 2021 before anything new kicks in and demand is a little bit lacklustre on the infrastructure side? Ronnie Pruitt : I don't want to get into predicting the outcome of elections. I think we're well positioned with either outcome that infrastructure is a big need, and infrastructure is a need for our country, throughout all of our regions. And so I'm confident that infrastructure will be a critical -- not only need for the spin, but also for job creation for economic stimulus, it plays multiple roles in there. And so I think there's going to be lots of support for that under the outcome either way. Pass that, I think the financial markets, the interest rates I think our country is wanting to see stability. I think our country is wanting to see economic growth. And I think both parties realize that. And so, I think we'll have to just take the wait and see approach and see what happens. But we're well prepared for any scenarios that come our way. Paul Roger : I think it's quite interesting. Because obviously, Mr. Biden is proposing quite a green agenda. And I think actually within his proposal $1.3 trillion of infrastructure spending, there is a big emphasis on more sustainable products. So I think I'm going to say U.S. Concrete does have a low CO2 product in California. Do you see a situation where the penetration of this type of product that may actually increase if there is more focus on the green agenda? And what could that do to margins and pricing if anything? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes. Every region is different. And it really comes down to the local specifiers and DOTs and the push for those greener initiatives. Carburetor is great product and we're definitely an early adopter of that. And we're going to be rolling that out into other regions. Flash is a great recycled product as well. There's also flash shortages with as you think about taking down Coalfired power plants, there's more issues there. Slag is another product that we use throughout all of our regions. It's also a green product. So we have lots of initiatives for recycling, we're using more recycled aggregates in all of our operations. And we continue that focus. But at the end of the day, the specifiers the local DOTs, the local architects and engineers are responsible for specifying those products. And all of them have different levels of potential margin improvements. And I think again, we're here to meet whatever the market demand is. We've put the technology in place where we're adapting quickly to that greener wave that's coming. And I think we'll be able to meet that demand no matter what it is. Operator : Gentlemen next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open. Trey Grooms : Nice results and great job, getting a stuff environment especial on the margins. I guess on the 4Q guide, I think, I heard was it $40 million to $45 million, I heard that right? Are you seeing or are you assuming any change in the demand picture baked into that range there? Or is it more kind of the same on the demand front? Ronnie Pruitt : I think we've baked in a lot of different scenarios into that number. And normal seasonality is what we refer to it first. And so as you know, seasonality affects our business and in our markets, obviously, the Northeast can have a wide variety of winter weather, and Texas can be dry or wet. And then with California, we're trying to bake in a more normal supply side, and that's been our biggest issues there. And so I think, it's a combination of what we see in our pipeline, and what we believe a normal weather pattern would contribute to that. And so we've always seen a drop off in the first quarter, because of those normal weather patterns. And so I think, as a visibility today, we like what we see. And we believe that those results would be delivering a very good year for U.S. Concrete. Trey Grooms : John, during your prepared comments, I think you mentioned that each region has seen some declines in demand. So, North Texas has been relatively strong. Did you guys, was there any change in that market? Or any other colors you give around that? Ronnie Pruitt : I'll take that Tray, because I mean, at the end, we continue to see sequential improvements as the restrictions were lift. And we talked about that in the second quarter and I would say in North Texas market, and really our Texas Supreme because West Texas would be included. And I think we had a good quarter and I'm very pleased with our results and I don't want to use weather as an excuse. But in September, we had nine weather days. And last year, September, we had zero. Literally zero weather in Texas last year in 2019. And we just weather in September and so I'm not using that as an excuse, but it does impact and volume will shift. And we will see those shifts continue. But it was, it is something that definitely impacts our day in and day out volume when we have that kind of dramatic difference year-over-year in one month. Trey Grooms : But no change in kind of the underlying demand that you've been seeing there and that well in Texas, I guess overall. I know West Texas has probably seen some slowing, but I guess on a sequential basis from 2Q outside of weather sounds like things are still kind of as they were? Ronnie Pruitt : Again, I think we'll continue to see shifts in what those segments are. And I think as we continue to see more residential, it'll lead. And the good thing for us in these suburban markets that we do serve, including not just West Texas, and we serve a lot of rural areas and our ready mix footprint as well as we stretch out from the DFW Metroplex. I think we'll see the continued underlying demand there. It's just going to be formed in different ways. And so as residential now takes the lead on that, obviously as you see these residential pockets that are in these outlying areas, we'll see like commercial and other support of whether those are schools or churches or other things. But I think overall, we've continued to see very consistent demand cycles. Trey Grooms : Got it. Thanks for that. And, John this one kind of goes back to you just as a housekeeper. I think you mentioned -- excuse me incentive cost to increase in 4Q. Is there any more color you can give us around that? John Kunz : Yes, I mean, last year the incentive compensation numbers that we paid out are relatively nominal for the year. Our expectation is that we will have a payout this year associated with them. So we had to accrue. And we included a higher number a couple million dollars in expense more this year than what we ultimately recognized last year. I really can't tell you what a full year number is, because it's going to depend on our performance in Q4. We have to perform in Q4 and to be able to earn a bonus, or earn a incentive compensation. But that situation may persist as we go into Q4. Because again last year, it would be a much lower number than what would otherwise be anticipated this year. Trey Grooms : I got it. Okay, that makes sense. And last one for me. You guys did a great job on free cash flow exceeded your targets there? How are you thinking about free cash flow generation going forward maybe 4Q and maybe beyond that? John Kunz : Sure, the color on Q4 Ronnie said, our EBITDA ranges that $40 million to $45 million. So you can sort of work back. Our CapEx guidance is around $30 million. So there's -- that delta between year-to-date and that guidance is one. And then what you shouldn't overlook as well is we do pay the premium on the notes redemption. So that's an incremental $12 million.  So we'll have the normal interest expense and $12 million of incremental expense for the fees associated with the redemption. So you can do the math around that sort of gets to your cash flow number. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open Stanley Elliott : Nice work in a very tough environment. Could you talk a little bit about some of the things you're learning from the where's my concrete? Some of the best practices metrics whether it's how long you're on location, or any sort of these internal improvements that you're gaining insight to that I think can be transferred across all the regions. Ronnie Pruitt : Yes. Good morning. And great question. Stanley as we look at the full integration of not just where's my concrete, but the CRM piece of that along with our Driver app, along with our Customer app. We're measuring like you say on job times, we're measuring in plant times, we're measuring time for the drivers to check in, we punch in in the cab. So we're measuring so many different things today that a year ago, two years ago, five years ago were unheard of. The more critical thing to me is we're capturing that in a way that as we load that information into our CRM and then our sales force is out there looking at how we quote jobs in the future. We're no longer in a position that we're just quoting something on material margin and then we have a rough estimate of delivery cost. And then we think that here's the margin that can be. Now we know down to the customer level, how does that customer order? What's their behavior? How do they place concrete? How do they hold our trucks? How do they use our equipment? And we're feeding all that into a system. And now we're literally specifically going down to the customer level and being able to quote jobs based on what we have, I would say, a much higher confidence level in what margins we'll be able to generate, who is no longer just a price in a material margin. And so as we take all this data, it goes into our scheduling, it goes into the way we dispatch, it goes into the way we anticipate labor, most drivers, plant labor, raw materials, it just flows for a whole system that. Again, I've talked about it in the last quarter. We're a very, very, very good company that reacting. We react extremely well. What we're trying to be as a better company predicting. And if we can get to a company that is really good at predicting what will happen instead of reacting to what will happen. Obviously, we can be way better at driving margin improvements when we anticipate and predict and not react. Stanley Elliott : And then switch gears a little bit on the pricing on the ready mix side. I apologize if you mentioned a conversation. But with California being down, Texas doing good, New York sound like it's good, too. How much of the improvement was regional mix? And then I guess the other question is with residential looking like that, it's going to be probably the strongest market for most of the materials space in 2021. Does that have a negative impact in terms of your reported price or margin, as we're looking forward? Ronnie Pruitt : There could be some definite mix in that. And there's obviously differences in strengths in residential versus your higher complex commercial and infrastructure projects. I think the most exciting thing for me was that we were able to move pricing in all of our markets. And we talked about that was achieved in all markets. And so even with a drop off of volume in one of our higher priced markets and more of a shift into Texas, we still were able to show pricing improvement in all of our markets. And I think that gets back into your previous question about technology, how we use that, how we are smarter the way we price. And then as John mentioned, the material margin across our footprint was up as well. And so, we're able to see where raw materials are going to influence, we're able to see where logistics influences, and then we're able to, obviously target those margins. And so I would continue to tell you Stanley that EBITDA margin, that material margin, those things we're measuring will be a much better indicator of how we're running the business. We're going to continue to push pricing everywhere, and we'll push pricing as hard as we can. But at the end of the day, there is going to be fluctuations in use markets and shrinks and mixes and all that stuff will be noise. But if you focus down to our material margin, you focus on to our overall EBITDA margin. I think that's where you'll see how this technology and our ability to be smarter and what we do will continue to pay off. Operator : Our next question comes from Rohit Seth with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Rohit Seth : I just want to talk a little bit about the shift from urban to suburban. I spent for the past cycles, a lot of focus on your urban footprint and a lot of your production capacity is in the New York and San Francisco region. And so, how do you think about your positioning and enables a strategy to run the business in this upcoming cycle where there might be a secular trend going the opposite direction? And then given the capacity you already have, and maybe outside the very city cores is that enough production capacity to sustain sort of the earnings level that you're doing right now? Ronnie Pruitt : So that's a great question. And, as we look at those footprints, specifically in those reasons as you highlighted and I was able to travel a couple of weeks ago up to New Jersey and New York. And, as I look at what's happening in those markets, we've talked about this in the past. I mean, a lot of our production capacity is a rolling stock. And so when you think about some of the rural areas that we service in the New Jersey market, and even around our New York footprint, that production is really shifted by our ability to move trucks. And so we can move those trucks pretty easy, like literally in a day. And, in the borough's we're seeing a lot of activity around affordable housing, we're still seeing a lot of activity in our pipeline. We're still pouring concrete in Manhattan, and even though everyone thinks Manhattan is completely shut down, we're still -- we did projects there yesterday. So we are so important anchoring in those areas. I think the San Francisco San Jose market is a -- it's an interesting one for us as we look at how we projected normal data around permits and data around other economic things in the tech money there's just one that is really hard to predict. I think there's still a lot of money in that area. We're still doing a lot of projects there. But we're also able to put in that area to further out around the San Jose markets to those residential as well. And again, I mean, we have capacity on wheels. And so we move those wheels and we can meet that capacity, we have plenty of plant capacity. So it's really our ability to shift with the drivers and the trucks where we need them. And I think that's the flexibility we have. Rohit Seth : And so but I mean, you still have to have your own plant network, because the trucks can only move so far, to keep that concrete in the mixer within spec. So there is a transportation limitations they're not? Ronnie Pruitt : I mean, I think there's a transportation limitation. But when you think about, where a lot of our plants are we were traveling, 15 to 20 to 30 miles into metropolitan areas. You flip that around, and you're going 15 to 20 to 30 miles outside of metropolitan area, that's a pretty big reach. And so when you think about these big urban areas and you say, okay, well, you could go 30 miles in or 30 miles out, so you got a 60 mile circle there, that's a pretty good reach that we can still hit them. And we've got trucks from West Texas, that will grab over an hour, one way to get the job.  So we have the expertise, we have chemicals, we can do things with concrete today that we couldn't do two years ago that we couldn't do three years ago. We have technology on our trucks to control swamp, we can add mix on the flight chemicals, while the trucks going down the road, we can be adding chemicals to it to again anticipate what the concrete needs for the customer to control the swamps, to control the set times to control all kinds of opportunities there.  We're just doing so many things different than what's read mix business is historically been. And I think we're going to go into way more detail on that at our investor presentation on November 12. I'm going to break it down and really show people the differences of concrete today and I think it's just a misnomer that you only got an hour. And that's all you can do. And if you don't get it done an hour, I mean you're in trouble. That's just not the case today. We partner with a lot of our chemical companies to put this technology in place. We're constantly maximizing and optimizing our mixes. So I think we have a lot of versatility around pivoting to those urban areas or rural areas of whichever direction we want to go. Rohit Seth : And given those developments, you can effectively compete with some of the smaller guys? And then on Polaris, can you usually provide an update on your expansion plans of Blackbeard Cory and 2021 could be a significant year in that regard. So just remind us, what the plan is? How much capitals required and expected grants? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes, I appreciate that. I would tell you that on our Investor Day, November 12, I'm going to break down that entire project and what they mean could be. So I would like to say that for them. But we continued on the path of the opportunities we've talked about and Blackbeard, one of the bigger opportunities that we have, and I'll be giving a lot more color of that on the removed flow. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : I'm working with Brent Thielman today. Question for you about your Coram aggregates business. I'm wondering how your expectations for that company has changed since you acquired the company in February? Ronnie Pruitt : I don't think our expectations have changed at all. I think when we acquired that company, although it was right at the beginning of, and anticipated pandemic. We had done business with that company for a long time. The operation has been critical to New York for a long time. And our expectations were absolutely that it was a very strategic purchase for us. And I don't think nothing through this has changed other than the fact that, it's probably been even more strategic through this interruption in different pandemic related things. But long term, it's meeting or exceeding all of our expectations. Unidentified Analyst : And then, I'm wondering, are you cultivating a pipeline of potential acquisition candidates right now? And have you observed any more willing sellers since your last earnings call in August? Ronnie Pruitt : I would say, we're going to give a lot more color into our longer term strategy on our November the 12 call was with investors. But at the end of the day, I don't see it as cultivating, because we're not out there cold calling people to see if they want to sell. I think at the end of the day, we're going to present our investors with long-term strategic value and what we do. And we're going to be very disciplined around what we do. And we're going to let a lot of different factors around our capital structure around our leverage, around how we trade or on our multiples and a balance between our aggregates and ready mix acquisitions. And so I would say we have lots of opportunities that we'll be going into more in-depth with on the call in November. Unidentified Analyst : I look forward to that call in a couple of weeks here. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Great, thanks. Good morning, Ronnie and John. Congrats on the quarter ability to certainly navigate through a tough environment. Can you maybe just parse out a little bit more on the pricing on the aggregate size of near 13% increase at symptoms that was certainly mixed. And can maybe just help us pocket some of the drivers there. Is that Coram? Is there, I assume maybe the NW Ranch is helping there as well. Can you maybe help us with? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes, Larry. Great question. I would say yes, obviously Coram helps. Coram is a closest suppliers. And when you think about pricing in the way we look at the closer to the market. So the higher the FOB prices so Coram has definitely been a contributor of that. I would also point out that we -- for the first time ever, we exceeded over a million tons of shipments through our Long Beach terminal from Coram which Southern California, that Long Beach terminal is a very good price point as well. So we're getting lift there. And then yes, I mean, the Texas market has been solid. And so, I think there's obviously on a like for like basis Coram was a very big lift. But we've seen very momentum in all markets. I'm pleased with where we're at in all of our markets.  And I think again, as we look at our focus strategically around more growth in our aggregate side, I mean this is what the expectations would be from our investors that aggregate is more disciplined. Aggregates is more reliable, and aggregates is more sustainable through any whether that's a pandemic or any other economic down headwinds. And I think we're proving that out. Larry Solow : Right, okay. Great. And then similarly on the ready mix side. I assume mix probably may have actually impacted your pricing, but you still were able to 2% year-over-year gain. So was pricing actually up in all your markets? Ronnie Pruitt : Yes, it was up across the board. And again, I would -- I think, as you think through the headwinds that we've faced through the pandemic and what normal reactions would be or could be during economic downturns in ready mix. And I think again the industry is tagged with being undisciplined and all these other things that happened in 2007, or '08 and '09 and now we're trying to overcome those things from 10 to 15 years ago.  There's been a lot of consolidation and a lot of markets and not just the markets we're in. There's been a lot of consolidations over the last 10 years. And I think there's just more discipline out there in pricing. And I think technology is a big piece of this. And I still, there's a big difference in the way concrete priced in the way cement is priced in a way aggregate is priced. And concrete is literally priced on a daily basis with good jobs every single day. And we have an opportunity. And we have an opportunity that we can take it either way. Our choice is to continue to be very disciplined around our pricing strategy.  And so I think a lot of those processes and the way we look at things during this time is paying dividends around the way we choose the price. Larry Solow : Just anecdotally discussed, sort of any changes in sort of levels of pipeline or sort of level of bidding activity as we sort of look out. And I don't want to do -- ready to give any guidance, but is that remained fairly constant any material changes over the last few months. Ronnie Pruitt : It's interesting, we track a lot of different data points. And when pipeline, bidding activity tracking different metrics of all kinds. And obviously, we've seen lots of activity on the residential side. And the residential piece of our markets are a lot more shorter timeframe from quote to execution. And so literally, if we're executing on those on a daily basis. I would say we're still seeing a lot of activity in our bidding activity. And if anything, we continue to see a slower pace from actual business start. And I think those are the trends we'll just have to overcome through the next of several months of getting the election path system and figuring out what's the next opportunities there as the market starts to rebound? Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Ronnie Pruitt, President and Chief Executive Officer for any closing remarks. Ronnie Pruitt : Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. And we look forward to your participation in our Investor Day on November the 12. Until then, stay safe and be well. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude your program and you may now disconnect.",

Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We hope you and your families are and will continue to be safe and healthy. 2020 represented another year of strong earnings growth for Vulcan, despite the many challenges associated with the pandemic. Our results demonstrated the strength, flexibility and resilient nature of our aggregates business. But most of all, 2020 demonstrated the commitment of Vulcan employees as they face uncertainty and had to make adjustments both in their professional and their personal lives.  Our team stayed focused on operating safely, servicing our customers and making progress on our 4 strategic disciplines. Congratulations on a job well done. In a few minutes, Suzanne will share some fourth quarter highlights with you, but first, I'd like to summarize our full year 2020 accomplishments and discuss broad themes and where we are headed.  Our full year financial results were strong. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $1.324 billion, and EBITDA margin expanded by 150 basis points. Cash generation continued to be strong with operating cash flows increasing by 9% to $1.1 billion. And finally, one of our principal measures, return on invested capital, improved by 40 basis points to 14.3%. These results were particularly noteworthy considering our annual aggregates volume declined by 3% as compared to 2019. Higher average selling prices and effective cost control were key drivers of this performance.  Aggregates pricing improved by just over 3% on both a reported and mixed adjusted basis. Importantly, these pricing gains were widespread across our footprint. Our total cost of sales per ton increased by 2%, while our unit cash cost of sales, which is more controllable, only grew by 1%. This led to a 5.5% gain in our aggregates cash gross profit per ton. At $7.11, we are making good progress toward our longer-term goal of $9 per ton. This improvement in unit profitability was supported by our 4 strategic disciplines : Commercial excellence; operations excellence; logistics innovation; and strategic sourcing. We also experienced improvements in each of our non-aggregates business segments. Collectively, gross profit improved 12% across these 3 segments. Europe profitability increased in both asphalt and concrete. Asphalt gross profit increased $12 million or 19% over the prior year, even though volumes declined 7%. This improvement in profitability resulted from stable sales prices and lower liquid asphalt cost. Our ready-mix concrete unit profitability increased 8%. Average selling prices increased by 2% and volume declined by 5%, primarily as a result of the cement shortages in California. The higher profitability in each of our business segments and our improving overall EBITDA margin set us up well for 2021. We are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities in our geographic footprint. The demand environment is also improving, particularly in residential construction and highway construction. Let's take each market segment in turn.  Residential continues to show strength, especially in single family. The market fundamentals of low interest rates and reduced supply suggests that the growth will continue. This represents a clear opportunity for us as both permits and starts are growing faster in Vulcan-served markets.  Highway lettings and awards returned to growth in the fourth quarter. State DOT budgets have stabilized, with most of our states showing budgets flat to up from 2020. The caution in this market segment is that it will require time to turn awards into shipments given the midyear 2020 loan awards due to the pandemic. While timing of shipments is a variable, we will see improvement in highway shipments throughout 2021. As we said in the third quarter, the near-term outlook for the nonresidential construction sector provides the least forward visibility. Dodge construction starts are still down year-over-year, but certainly, indicators are beginning to improve, perhaps signaling that potential improvement is just around the corner. Weakness lingers in the office space and hospitality related sectors, but there is growth in the heavier nonresidential categories like distribution facilities and data centers. In fact, warehouses are now the largest nonresidential category as measured by square feet and represent approximately 1/3 of construction awards. These projects are typically more aggregate intensive, and 90% of the near-term growth in this sector will occur in Vulcan serviced states according to Dodge. The administration and Congress are committed to an infrastructure-led economic recovery and have indicated that they will focus on an infrastructure built next after the COVID-19 relief package. Clearly, our leading market positions will mean broad participation in infrastructure-related spending. We believe demand for aggregates will continue to improve as we progress through 2021. That being said, the timing of shipments to highway projects and nonresidential construction projects remains a variable. We consider these factors as we thought about our 2021 prospects and guidance. That said, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.34 billion and $1.44 billion. We anticipate 2021 aggregate shipments could fall in a range of a 2% decline to a 2% increase as compared to 2020. Regardless of volume swings, we will improve our full year unit profitability in aggregates. We expect aggregates freight adjusted average selling prices to increase by 2% to 4% in 2021. And gross profit in our non-aggregate segments was forecast to improve by mid-single to mid-high single digits. To sum it up, 2021 will turn out to be a year of solid earnings growth. Now I'll turn it over to Suzanne for further comments. Suzanne? Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. Before I discuss fourth quarter 2020 highlights, I'll fill in some additional details on our 2021 guidance. We made significant reductions in our selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020. We expect to further leverage our overhead cost in 2021 and anticipate our SG&A expenses to be between $365 million and $375 million. We anticipate interest expense to approximate $130 million for the full year. Barring any changes to federal tax law, our effective tax rate will be about 21%. The category of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expenses will be around $400 million. Now with respect to capital expenditures, we invested $361 million in 2020. We expect to spend between $450 million and $475 million in 2021. This includes fully restarting and advancing growth projects that were delayed last spring, such as the opening of a new quarry in California, capacity expansion at other quarries and improvements to our logistics and distribution network. It also reflects a catch-up of operating CapEx that was postponed at the start of the pandemic. As always, we'll carefully monitor the economic environment and adjust our capital spending as necessary. As you model, you'll note that the combination of our assumptions for 2021 leads to another healthy year of cash generation. I'll now give a little color on the fourth quarter of 2020.  Adjusted EBITDA was $311 million, up 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Aggregates volume declined by 1%, while reported pricing increased by 3% and mix adjusted pricing by 2%. Costs were slightly higher in the quarter due to additional stripping costs in advance of future shipping growth and the timing of repairs. There were 2 items that affected the comparability of our fully diluted earnings per share in both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 as compared to those same periods in 2019. First, we recorded a onetime noncash pension settlement charge of $23 million or $0.13 per diluted share in connection with a voluntary lump sum distribution of benefits to certain fully vested plan participants. This liability management action will benefit future pension expense and funding requirements. And second, the tax rate for fourth quarter and full year 2020 was higher than in the comparable periods in 2019. Last year, the tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and R&D credits were greater than the same benefits in 2020. The resulting EPS effect was $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $0.18 per diluted share for the full year.  Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position remains very strong, with a weighted average debt maturity of 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.6x as of December 31, reflecting $1.2 billion of cash on hand. Approximately $500 million of this cash will be used to repay a debt maturity coming due next month. As Tom mentioned, our cash flow was robust in 2020 and contributed to year-over-year leverage reduction. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the resulting slowdown in economic activity, M&A was lighter than usual in 2020. We returned $206 million to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. Our capital allocation priorities which have helped to drive an improvement of 220 basis points and our return on invested capital over the last 3 years remain unchanged.  And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thanks, Suzanne. Before we go to Q&A, I would like to thank our investors our customers and our Vulcan family for their support during a challenging year. We will continue to operate Vulcan for the long-term and our focus on building an even stronger and more profitable business. We know that our leading market positions and our aggregates-focused business are strengths, along with our strong balance sheet. When combined with the execution capabilities that we demonstrated in 2020 as well as solid long-term fundamentals, we are excited about our future. While there may be challenges in 2021, we have confidence in its potential. Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc. Trey Grooms : Tom, I appreciate your comments in the prepared remarks there on the end markets. But maybe if you could walk us through some of the puts and takes around the aggregates volume outlook for this year of a 2% decline to a 2% increase and maybe how you can get to the low end versus the high end of that guide? Tom Hill : Yes. I'll start with just kind of stepping back and looking at the year 2021. As you saw, our guidance was negative 2% to positive 2% on volume. I would tell you that the aggregate demand outlook is improving and it seems to get brighter kind of week in and week out. And we would expect shipments to continue to improve sequentially as we march through 2021. Residential construction is very good and continues to grow. At the same time, heavy nonresidential construction is good, and it's important because of its aggregate intensity. At the same time, light nonresidential construction has been a challenge, and I think will be a headwind for us in the first half of 2021 probably getting better later in the year. And then highway lettings are much better. They were much better in the fourth quarter, and we think they'll continue to be strong throughout 2021. So this all adds up to starts and demand picture improving and will continue to prove as we march through the year. But as you know, the demand outlook environment due to the pandemic has been quite volatile. So as we set our guidance to you, for 2021, we try to be both transparent and thoughtful about 2 really important things with a given that we know residential is strong and growing. So the first one of those is nonresidential construction shipments. We know warehouses and distribution centers are good. They're growing. They're intensive. They're aggregate intensive. We believe that overall, non-res has stabilized from the fall we saw throughout 2020. Now how fast that returns, we don't know. The other thing that we're seeing now, which is a bright spot is we're seeing the LNG projects start to pop up on the Gulf Coast that were postponed from last year.  So we'll just have to see what transpires with the rest of nonresidential construction. And then the second thing we try to be thoughtful about was the timing of highway work. Lettings were -- if you remember, were light in Q3 of last year's DOTs tried to assess their funds or what was going to happen to their budgets. As once that stabilized, Q4 saw great lettings as should Q1 and the rest of 2021 as most DOTs have verified that their budgets will be up to flat to up. And so the question is, how fast are those lettings and those projects go to work. As I said, we think it will be back half loaded. All said, in all markets, our outlook is improving kind of week-over-week as the pandemic improves, so getting better, but still some things we got to watch. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Tom, could you talk about maybe expectations for replacement of the FAST Act in terms of potential timing, magnitude and when that could ultimately impact your volumes? Tom Hill : Yes. So we believe that Congress is going to pass a new highway bill with an increase in funding in 2021. And I would probably give you that in 3 buckets. One that the Biden administration, their agenda has infrastructure next on the list after the COVID-19 build. So it is a priority.  Second, if you go to the House and Senate, Senator Carper, who is Chair of the EPW Committee and then Congressman DeFazio, who's Chair of the House T&I Committee, both have said they want draft bills out of committee before August -- before the August recess. And the reason they want to do that is they want to target passing a bill before the expiration of the FAST Act at the end of September. So the administration is on it. The Congress and House is on it.  And then third, remember that funding should increase as highway funding right now is starting from a position of strength. So in 2021, the funding is up $12 billion year-over-year to $59 billion. $2 billion of that is an increase from appropriations, $10 billion of that is from COVID relief. This starts the highway funding baseline from a higher point and no one on the hill wants to reduce funding for highways. So we believe that we'll see it before the end of the year, hopefully before the expiration of the FAST Act, and we'll think it will be at higher levels. Anthony Pettinari : Great. Great. That's very helpful. And then just maybe switching gears. We're obviously seeing historically cold weather in the U.S. South and some middle parts of the country. As well as some power outages in states like Texas and some other places that you operate. Understanding the situation is very dynamic. I'm just wondering if you could help us understand what you're seeing on the ground and maybe potential impact if this could be more along with. Tom Hill : Well, in Central Alabama, it's snowing this morning. But look, it's the first quarter. It's January, February, March. It's the smallest quarter. You're going to have weather. I would tell you that this is not a lot different from a big week of rain. You just -- you have an interruption, the demand doesn't go away. It is interrupted in the first part of the year, and we'll catch it up. So I chalk it up to the first quarter and would not read a lot into it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Thompson : Really focusing a little bit more on the state DOT side, our state revenue report which focuses on many of your states are showing much better general fund collections. And you also noted in your prepared commentary of the better. DOT trends. From our perspective, California, Georgia, Illinois, are looking pretty good going into '22. I wanted to get your thoughts on that? And could you give color on these states, other states that are important for you, like Texas, Virginia and Florida. And layering on top of that, what if any impact does the current administration's green focus have on how state dots are planning their future projects? Tom Hill : I'm sorry, I missed the last part, are planning what? Kathryn Thompson : Their future projects. So just with the Biden administration folks on green. Tom Hill : As we said, we've got a little bit of a gap with lettings down in Q3. They came storming back in Q4. If you look at the trailing 6-month and trailing 3-month starts, they're up double digits. So that's really good news. Based on the state DOT budgets, which you pointed out, improvements in those budgets, we should see growth, we should see improvement in highway work and should grow as we march through 2021, particularly as we see those lettings in the fourth quarter talk to mature the shipments.  The majority of our 20 states will see funding and lettings up for fiscal year 2021, particularly as you pointed out, important states like Texas and California, and really importantly, our southeastern states, which are either up year-over-year or they're flat from '19, which was -- excuse me, flat from '20 which saw a big jump from '19. So really good solid funding. We're past the interruption of the pandemic. And then you've got the $10 billion of COVID-19 relief funds for highways. More than half of that $10 billion will be spent in Vulcan served states and support growth. Some of that in 2021, although it presently appears that the majority of those funds will support shipments in '22, maybe going a little bit into '23. So all of this, I'd tell you, is good news, and we still have to let the shipments catch up with the recently improved lettings. So we could see this, I would tell you, probably a little better in Q3 and Q4 maybe within Q1. But good news, and it has stabilized, and now we're starting -- the funding is growing, and we think the Feds will support that later in the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood of UBS. Nishchal Sood : So I wanted to ask first about the SAG, the guidance for roughly $370 million. So returning to 2019 levels, can you just talk about some of the dynamics there? Are you assuming a full return to pre-pandemic cost structures? I'm sure there was some unusual reduction in expenses last year, or do you think there are some expenses that you're anticipating will be sustainably lower going forward? Suzanne Wood : Yes. We are definitely not expecting a return to the prior cost structure. I mean, for the year, we reduced our SAG costs by $11 million or 3%. And we talked about that previously. I mean, basically, we benefited from some cost reduction actions that we took right at the end of 2019 as well as some ongoing initiatives that we put in place during the pandemic in 2020 and certainly contributing to some of that certainly not all of it was lower T&E. And as we talked about in the third quarter, I mean that's really an area where this year, depending on what happens with vaccine distribution, et cetera. I mean, we may see a little bit of an increase, but we certainly are not going to return to the old normal there.  We've learned a lot during this time as have a lot of other companies about different, more efficient ways of communicating and accomplishing what we need to do. So we are always looking for ways to leverage SAG. I suspect we will continue to find some more of those as we go through. The range that we set if you look at the midpoint of the range in terms of SAG as a percentage of revenue, that's 7.3%, just a tick under 7.4%. So we'll see where we get to in the year. But certainly, as we did last year, we continue to look for ways to reduce that, and that improvement really sort of accelerated through the year. And if we find that we're doing a little better-than-expected as we go through the year, then we'll update the guidance. Nishchal Sood : Got you. Got you. And then also on the non-aggregates businesses, you had a very strong performance in 2020 with the increase in gross profit despite the lower revenues, the mid-single-digit to high single-digit continued increase. So building upon that. Can you just walk us through -- I imagine you're assuming some resumption of revenue growth. Some of the input costs like liquid asphalt might be a little bit higher. So just wondering if you could walk us through some of the drivers on that mid- to high single-digit growth in the gross profits. Tom Hill : Sure. That mid-single high digit -- mid- to high single-digit growth is really driven primarily by asphalt, and I would tell you, it's really driven by volume in asphalt, which is improved DOT work. And what happens in those states where we're producing asphalt, places like Texas, California, Arizona, Alabama and Tennessee. And it's just -- it's bigger jobs and more work, simply that. Ready-mix, we have it up slightly with -- and it's really more unit margin-driven than volume-driven. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : I just wanted to ask, really impressive outlook for aggregates gross profit growth of $70 million on flat volumes, so essentially pricing dropping down to the bottom line. But I know you're going to be facing a headwind from diesel costs, labor inflation. So can you just talk about what's allowing you to offset those inflationary items of, call it, $50 million, $60 million that still allows you to drop down the pricing straight to the bottom line? Tom Hill : Yes, I'm not sure I'd go headwinds. I think our headwinds are less than that. But if you look at our guidance for unit margins and the cost piece of unit margins, it's underpinned really by our focus on our operating disciplines and processes. We -- if you look back, we saw our aggregates operating efficiencies last year, whether that's throughput, plant availability, later efficiencies improve. At the same time, we had -- if you look at yield and energy efficiencies, they were mostly flat to slightly down, really due to production volumes being volatile and some product split issues on yield all of which were, I would tell you, pandemic related.  So as we look forward to 2021, we'd expect a headwind of the diesel prices that impact us in some -- I'd tell you some $10 million to $20 million. But in spite of this, we would expect our unit cash cost for aggregates to be flat to maybe up a little bit. And it's really supported by our operating strategic disciplines that we've been working on in those processes that we've been putting in for the last 2 years. I would tell you that I'm really proud of our operators, first of all, for keeping each other safe and healthy in a tough year and working through a tough year, but also their relentless quest for continuous improvement in those drivers of our operating efficiencies that drive your cost savings. They make -- really are making an impact on what we're seeing on our unit margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl : A couple of things you just answered, especially on the cost. So that was helpful color. I guess just on the volume piece within aggs, you gave some good commentary on kind of end markets. But if we're thinking about cadence through the year, any comments around kind of cadence that we should be thinking about first half versus second half from a volume perspective in aggs within the guide? Tom Hill : Yes, I would expect second half will be heavily loaded. But I would also tell you, Mike, that I would think as we progress through the year kind of month in and month out, week in and week out, that we'll see improvements. And what you're seeing there is improvements of the overall view of the world. And so whether it's nonres projects, that people have confidence in to start back up or whether it's highway projects that are maturing because they've been let and now they're kicking in. I think you'll see that sequential improvement as we march through 2021. Michael Dahl : Okay. And just a quick follow-up on that sequential improvement. Obviously, there is still some seasonality, right? And I think there was a question earlier around the weather. But just to be clear, in terms of sequential improvement, that's not a comment that we should expect volumes up sequentially each quarter relative to 4Q, right? Tom Hill : No. What I would -- what I'm comparing it to is the quarter in the prior year. So Q1, Q2 may be up a little more than Q2 last year versus what Q1 was and so forth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies. Philip Ng : I guess, a few of your peers on the heavy side have reported, actually, they're expecting low to mid single-digit growth in 2021. Appreciating the range you've provided is quite wide. But would have thought just based on your footprint and just your comments on resi and highway being up, you could see a little more growth. Are you baking in a little conservatism? And then when should we expect volumes to be up year-over-year? Is that more back half? Or could we see that happen as soon as 2Q, Tom? Tom Hill : I think, as we said, the variance in our range is more timing of work. And the key timing is, number one, on highways, we know it's gotten better because the lettings have gotten better. The question is the timing of how fast are those lettings go to shipments. And we've seen projects go really fast, and we've seen projects over the last 2 or 3 years get delayed. Hopefully, the DOTs are mature, and we have less delays and it kicks in and goes faster in the year than we would anticipate. Weather is always an issue in the first quarter. But as the year progresses, in Q2 and Q3, things get better. Hopefully, that lines up with that highway work. On the nonres side, again, we see the strengths in the heavy, the light. We know we've got some headwinds. We think it's stabilized. How fast the private money has confidence in the economy goes back to work is to be seen. I think as we watched the first -- we're in the seventh week of 2021. And it's better in week 6 than it was -- in week 5 than it was in week 4. So things seem to get better. A lot of this is pandemic related that, that is getting better as that goes, the private money goes. So hopefully, it will go quicker than anyone anticipates. But to be seen, and as we said, with the visibility as best we could, we may -- we try to be thoughtful about how we plan for it. Philip Ng : Got it. But Tom, to be clear, you're not seeing any incremental bottleneck per se. You're saying, hey, we're giving us some cushion here just because we just don't know how quickly these DOT projects show up, but you're not seeing any incremental bottlenecks per se? Tom Hill : I'm not quite sure I understand your question. I'm sorry. Philip Ng : My question is, you made the point that you had visibility in terms of bidding activity, but how quickly this stuff ramps up is unclear. My question is, are you seeing any incremental bottlenecks that could delay this? Or it's pretty steady like what you've seen for some time. Tom Hill : No. I don't see any big bottlenecks delaying it. In fact, if anything, from the DOT perspective, the DOTs have matured over the last 2 or 3 years, into increased funding. And so they have the firepower, whether that's engineering or permitting or letting work. So I don't see any bottlenecks holding up. It's really just -- it needs to move through the process and the contractors go to work. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Great. You highlighted some of the stripping cost expenses that you saw in the fourth quarter. Just curious if you can quantify that. Does that imply some pull forward costs into -- from next year or from this year, if you will? And how should we think about incremental gross margins in aggregates in 2021? Tom Hill : Yes. So specifically, the stripping cost was up about $4.5 million, $5 million. But overall, the cost was up about $0.30 a ton in Q4. And if we look back at this, based on -- as we went into the fourth quarter, based on the success that we had for the full year and the pandemic getting better and markets getting better, and you couple all that -- you put all that together, and as we look forward to 2021 and the DOTs getting better, we made a decision to pursue some preventive maintenance projects on both fixed and mobile equipment. At the same time, we decided to reengage our larger stripping projects because we felt like that longer term, when I say that, we just don't look a year, we look 24, 36 months out because these are mines and you can't move very fast. We decided it was time to reengage the stripping project. So based on the visibility to demand factors improving and the fourth quarter being smaller from a volume perspective and us having the firepower and the people in the time to do the work, it was time to pull the trigger on the projects. Garik Shmois : Great. And can you provide some color on how you're thinking about incremental margins in 2021? Tom Hill : Yes. Incremental margins in times like this at this inflection point, incremental margins are probably not as meaningful. And I would encourage you to really turn to unit margins as a better metric. And we saw mid single-digit growth in 2020 even with volumes going down 3%. And we should see that kind of growth, mid-single-digit margin growth or growth in cash cost fund in 2021. And I think as you look at the factors of this and what we have in the plan, that's what we expect and continue on our March towards our $9 per ton of cash gross profit per ton regardless of what headwinds or tailwinds we see out there. Suzanne Wood : Yes. And I would just add to that, Tom's right. I mean, when there's volatility, when volumes are flat and/or declining you just get really strange math when you try to do these numbers. If you look back at 2020, we had quarters where the flow-through number, if you calculated it, could be 40% or it could be 240%. And so as we said all through 2020, and until we get back to the point where volumes are fully positive and moving forward, we're just going to continue to talk about the drivers and the cash gross profit because I just think that's more meaningful than the flow-through numbers just because it's just volatile and they're just strange numbers that really don't necessarily mean a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners of Bank of America. Timna Tanners : I wanted to just probe a little bit the infrastructure opportunity. Just a little bit more detail on if we do see this new infrastructure focus manifests itself in kind of more green energy or green projects. Can you kind of give us more detail on how that can affect your product mix and what the opportunity can look like? Tom Hill : Yes. I think if you kind of just step back and really simplify this, Vulcan is going to participate in all new construction. You just have to. Our rock has to go in the foundations. It has to go to the infrastructure. So as we see new green construction, aggregates demand will benefit, particularly if it's green projects where there are aggregate intensive construction projects, so things like water, sewer, alternative energy sources, all of which are going to be supported by this administration, those are pretty aggregate intensive and we'll benefit from that demand growth. Timna Tanners : Okay. Are there any that are more or less? I'm just trying to get a flavor of if we get an announcement, how to think about that? Tom Hill : The three I would point out that are quite agg extensive are going to be water sewer and wind energy. And then on top of that, if you look at -- obviously, ports and airports that are -- how you consider those green or not, but the green ones, I would say, are water sewer and wind energy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas of Vertical Research Partners. Michael Dudas : Encouraged to see your guide for cap spending this year. It looks like you -- just to clarify, are you -- the growth capital you're allocating is projects you deferred in 2020 pre-pandemic? Are there any new or expanded ones in that mix? And I guess a follow-on to that, how, Tom, are you seeing your business development team working and is 2021 an opportunity given where your balance sheet is to look a little bit more carefully at some opportunities relative to towards organic growth? Suzanne Wood : Yes. Sure. I'll address the CapEx question first. You're right. These are internal growth projects that have a good return and are important to us that we did defer when the pandemic hit last spring. You saw that we spent a bit more money in the fourth quarter than initially guided on CapEx, and that related to the restarting of a couple of these growth projects that we just wanted to get the jump on before we went into the new year. But really, they are principally the projects that we had in place last year, we'd like to go ahead and finish those as soon as we can since we lost a year on them and start reaping the benefit of that. And you're right. I mean, with respect to M&A, as we've talked about many times, 2020 was just a year of inactivity because things sort of shut down as a result of the pandemic. We are beginning to see some deals come to market. We're beginning to see a bit of a pickup there.  Certainly, given our position in the industry, if anything is coming to market, I mean, we're going to know about it, get contacted, and we're going to have a look at it, and we will continue to use the same disciplines that we've used in the past as we think about those deals. They've got to fit us strategically, they need to be returns enhancing, they need to be accretive. And look, when you look at our balance sheet, we have the firepower to do about anything we'd like to do. But we're going to be sensible about what we do and do deals that, as I said, fit the strategy and the returns criteria and don't lose all of the financial advantage that we've worked hard to create from a balance sheet position over the last few years. Tom Hill : I think that was well said, Suzanne. I think that, as Suzanne said, there was just a desert for M&A. In 2020, nothing happened, and you would expect it to come roaring back in 2021, and it's busy. And we -- as always, we'll be involved on those, and we'll do the deals that make sense to us, make sure we understand the markets we want to be in and what product lines those markets make attractive and the ones we're going to be in. As always, we'll be picky about them, but we'll also find the ones that fit us. Operator : Your next question comes from the lane of Courtney Yakavonis of Morgan Stanley. Courtney Yakavonis : Appreciate the comments you guys gave about how the first half versus second half cadence really depends on how those lettings turn into shipments. But can you give us any insight into how you're thinking about the cadence for pricing through the year? Will that be more consistent? Or is that also going to trend with how shipments trend? Also, any insight into pricing for your non-aggregates business? Tom Hill : Yes, good question. I think that -- first of all, fundamentally, the conditions for price increases continues to improve. The market is able to have visibility to improving demand really helps this. As we said, res is very healthy, continues to improve. Nonres, while it's seen its challenges also with doing the light side, that seems to have stabilized and it's got the -- you've got the heavy side that's doing very well. And you're laid on top of that. We're starting to see bubbling of LNG work. That's helpful. The lettings and visibility to lettings picking up is really good because everybody knows that work is coming. So I would -- all of this is good for pricing. I would expect price increases to build as we progress through 2021.  But remember, and I would -- that will also, I would tell you, you'll see that -- you'll see prices start to accelerate starting in Q2. We have some -- that's when the majority of our fixed plant prices go into impact. And so I would -- as you start kind of into Q2, I would see it accelerate throughout the year. And remember, while pricing is really important, the most important component of this is unit margins. And along with cost, we saw those grow almost 6% last year, with volumes being down. And I think we have confidence that we'll grow both price and unit margin again in 2021 regardless of what happens with outside volume forces. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. David MacGregor : I just wondering if you can talk about the sort of the regional disparities and the 1% decline in fourth quarter aggregate volumes, and maybe how you're thinking about regional disparities within that -- the shipment guidance for 2021? Tom Hill : Yes. So if you look at the fourth quarter, I would tell you that the Southeast was a strength for us. Kind of all the states in the Southeast, I would tell you that Arizona and Illinois were on the weak side. I would tell you that even though we had the challenges from fires and pandemic and cement shortages in California, it matched prior year, so improving things in California. As we look forward to volumes in 2021, I would tell you that most of our markets, we're seeing kind of marked -- we're seeing improvements. Again, the southeast is going to be a strength. I would tell you that Texas will be strong. And I would tell you that California is improving. California had so many headwinds last year that now a lot of those are gone. So we will see improvement there. But those will be strengths for us. David MacGregor : Right. Maybe you can talk about kind of just to build on the pricing question prior to me. Just help us understand the nonres pricing situation right now. And is pricing up in that segment? Is it close to comparable with the average? How are you thinking about '21? Tom Hill : There's really not a lot of different pricing variance by market segment. It's really more geographic and if you look at our footprint, we're planning on price increases across all of our footprint. So I wouldn't call out, it's hard -- really hard to call out pricing between res or nonres or highways because it's more along product line by geographic area. But I would point to it being fairly widespread both geographically and across all product lines, for us, as we look out to 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Wilson of Raymond James. Joshua Wilson : I wanted to ask some cash questions as well. Given your plans for CapEx, and we know you're going to pay down the $500 million maturity, but you're still carrying quite a bit more cash on your balance sheet than you did pre-pandemic. So Suzanne, can you give us your thoughts on how much of a war chest you want to maintain versus when you might consider restarting share repurchases or something like that? Suzanne Wood : Yes, sure. It's a good question. And I think as we went into the pandemic, there were certainly no intention or desire on our part per se to build a war chest. Because I think that's just having your cash sitting around on the balance sheet is not -- certainly not the best use of it in the long term. But given the uncertainty we faced as we took some of those decisions to delay CapEx, et cetera, I certainly think that having a bit of cash there for safety is certainly the right thing to do. You're right, the first use of the $1.2 billion will be to pay down the $500 million maturity in March. I mean, that's been long-planned and taken care of. I think as we think about the capital allocation priorities we've had in place for a long time that have really, I think, served us well. And are well understood by the market. If you think about the waterfall of those priorities and the order of them, the sort of other than maintaining and improving our dividend, which is critically important for us.  We want to make sure that, that can absolutely be sustained through the cycle. We are beginning to open up and spend a bit more cash on growth. That's the second priority in that capital allocation policy. And so we're going to be spending more on those internal growth projects. And look, as I said on M&A, we'll be looking at opportunities as they come down the path. I would say that, again, going back to that waterfall, those growth projects and dividends are of a higher priority to us than share repurchase. So I think we just need to wait a bit and see what materializes on the growth front. And then as we go through the year and see how the cash plays out and what other opportunities arise, then we've got plenty of time to consider the share repurchase. Joshua Wilson : And if I could follow-up, in terms of the CapEx guidance, is that pretty evenly spread through the year? Or is that back-end weighted? And for like 2022, is there some catch-up in '21 that makes it unusually higher? Or how should we think about the long-term CapEx rate? Tom Hill : First of all, there is some catch up. And I think Suzanne pointed that out, the catch-up is... Suzanne Wood : Yes. I mean, again, if you go back to the beginning, and maybe this is the easiest way to talk about it. If you go back to the beginning of 2020, our guidance then was to spend $475 million. We wound up only spending $361 million in 2020 as a result of the delay of those projects. So we're guiding to that $450 million to $475 million number. The intent there is to catch up a bit on operating CapEx and the growth projects. So there is a bit of catch-up there. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a material amount, but we do intend to restart those growth projects. Tom Hill : As far as the timing through the year, I'd tell you pretty evenly spend, it usually is more in the hot summer months where you can bill for the construction projects where some of the build is. The rest of it, the repair -- the replacement capital is evenly spent, the growth capital probably will be a little heavier in Q2 and Q3. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : A quick question for you, Tom. The states that you saw some weak volumes in Q4. So California, Arizona, Illinois. What's the outlook for those states specifically this year? Tom Hill : So California wasn't actually -- as it wasn't weak. It was actually -- it was flat. And flat with some pretty good headwinds. If you really kind of step back, California is an import state for us. So if you step back and look at that -- and look at California, the fires are out and the cement shortage is over. So already, things are better in California. And the 2021 demand is improving. Northern Cal -- is really kind of -- you got to separate northern California, Southern California, Northern Cal is recovering. But remember, it had the longest -- it has the longest recovery because it had the most severe shelter in place on top of that, you had the fires and cement shortages, which really hurt us that whole market in 2020. So we'll see improvement in 2021, but a little slower. Now if you look at the highway piece, which affects the whole market, SB1 lettings are going to increase -- or increasing this year by 14%. So we'll see growth, both growth in -- both improvement in aggregates and asphalt. And then in Southern California, we're going to see single -- excuse me, high single-digit to double-digit growth in residential and nonres is recovering with the warehouses and distribution center and even the like. So -- and I think if you step back and look at -- remember, look at California from last year's perspective, in spite of all the demand challenges and the pandemic and the fires and cement shortages. In 2020, we were still more profitable year-over-year than we were in 2019. So that unit profitability sets us up well in 2021 as we start to see -- now we're starting to see volumes improving along with unit margins. So California will be a better place without the challenges they had in 2020. Arizona, I believe that, again, the residential fee sector is good. I think it is -- the highway is solid, nonres improving. So Arizona is a pocket of population growth, which supports that. If you look at Illinois, it has its challenges, highway work will probably be -- if you pull in toll work, will be solid, but the other sectors and res is okay, but the other sectors still see challenges as does non-highway infrastructure. So somewhat of a challenged market for us. Operator : Our final question today will come from the line of Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Stanley Elliott : A question for you guys. Nice job again on the inventories. As we sit here today, kind of right on tracking towards kind of 2018 levels. You're talking about the highway business potentially picking up in the back part of the year. Do you anticipate any sort of mix issues from a production standpoint? Or should -- kind of where you're sitting here would be a good sign from the flow-through on that side? Tom Hill : Yes. I think you'll see somewhat improvement. You heard me talk a little bit in our cost comment about mix with yields. And with new construction, you get more basin fines which helps your yields. Granted it's at lower price, but you need that for the overall unit margin improvement. So if anything, I would tell you that I think the mix will be improved in 2021 over 2020, just because you have a better flow of new construction. And remember, on the residential side, you're going -- now you are at new subdivisions, not just build out subdivisions, which is, number one, is more aggregate intensive. Because you've now got to put it in the roads and the utilities, but it's also a better mix because you've got the substructure of basin fines under all those roads and utilities and under those slabs. So I think we'll see improvements, which will help pushing the margins as we look at 2021. Operator : I would now like to return the call to Tom Hill for any additional or closing comments. Tom Hill : So thank you for everyone for joining the call today. Thank you for your continuing support of Vulcan. I think we're proud of our 2020 performance. And we made good progress in 2020 to our longer-term goals. We believe we're going to take that momentum into 2021, and we look forward to sharing that news with you over the next few quarters. I hope all of you stay healthy, keep your family safe and healthy, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks. Suzanne Wood : Yes. Goodbye.

My name is Christie and I will be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now, I will turn the call over to your host Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our website vulcanmaterials.com. A recording of this call will be available for replay later today at our website. Please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks along with other disclaimers are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation, and other SEC filings. As the operator indicated, please limit your Q&A participation to one question. This will help maximize participation during our time together. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark and good morning to everyone. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. I want to begin by saying that our performance in the first quarter was a very promising start to the year. Demand in our markets continues to improve and our team executed well as evidenced by our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the gain on sale from our reclaimed quarry in California, was $244 million, up 22% compared to last year. This strong growth was driven in part by a 3% increase in aggregate shipments. Despite weather impacts across Texas and parts of the Southeast in February, we experienced a pickup in shipments and March proved to be a strong month. Residential starts continue to accelerate and highway starts also increased due to improved lettings in the third and fourth quarters of last year. We've experienced an increase in both the number of jobs and the shipping speed in the heavy nonresidential space which is also the most aggregate intensive. And finally, some of the jobs that had been postponed last year have started. With year-over-year improvement across our footprint pricing was the second driver of our EBITDA growth. Freight-adjusted aggregates pricing increased by 2% in the quarter. Adjusted for mix, the increase was 1.3%. This was as expected since we were shipping work that have been bid in the middle of the pandemic when there was uncertainty and a lack of demand visibility. As our 2021 price increases gain traction, we will see pricing improvement throughout the year. The third driver of EBITDA growth and the one most within our control was our exceptional cost performance in the quarter. Aggregate total cost of sales per ton was 2% lower than last year's first quarter. And cash cost of sales per ton declined by 3%. Cost control like this is an accomplishment and requires considerable discipline from our operators. The team focused hard on operational execution. And as a result, all of our operating parameters in the quarries improved year-over-year. We were pleased with the meaningful impact from our four strategic disciplines, which will continue to mature. The most compelling metric, continues to be our strong unit margin gains across the footprint. Aggregates, cash gross profit per ton, increased by 9%. This demonstrates the attractive operational earnings power of our aggregates business, when demand is combined with strong execution on our four strategic disciplines. Overall, our operating results this quarter, helped drive a 90 basis point improvement in our return on invested capital. Suzanne will provide further comments on this and other aspects of our financial performance. Let's now turn to our view of the end markets and then we'll cover how, that influence our outlook for the full year. Broadly speaking, the demand environment improved considerably over the last few months. Construction starts, as measured by Dodge, got better along with other leading indicators, like the Dodge Momentum Index and ABI. Construction employment levels continue to improve as well. Residential construction remains the strongest end market. There is pent-up demand for houses and new subdivisions are being built with more to come. The market fundamentals of low interest rates and reduced supply are still in place, which foreshadows continued growth. Housing starts are growing faster in Vulcan-served markets. The outlook for our nonresidential end markets remains limited. However, our quote activity has increased and leading indicators are improving, which suggest that a turnaround is happening. The strongest nonresidential sector relates to e-commerce and technology and encompasses data centers, warehouses and distribution facilities. According to Dodge, 90% of the growth in this sector will occur in Vulcan-served markets. Majority of non-res starts currently fits within this category, but we believe, a strong residential market combined with an increasingly open economy will drive additional demand in other nonresidential sectors. With respect to highways, state budgets and lettings are progressing as anticipated. We are seeing the improvement in lettings from the second half of 2020, now turning to shipments. The COVID-19 relief funds have provided a backstop for any loss transportation revenues for highways. Our country's leadership continues to work on an infrastructure package. Both parties have proposed substantial increases in highway funding and this is a priority for both the Democrats and the Republicans. To summarize, our view of end markets, demand is improving. We see evidence of this both on the ground with our customers and in the data from leading indicators. As a result, we've upgraded our aggregates volume guidance for 2021 to a range of 1% to 4% growth compared to 2020. Excluding the gain on the sale of the California property, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1.38 billion and $1.46 billion. As we look forward to consider opportunities, we have three paths to growth, with higher returns. Those paths are organic growth, M&A and greenfields. I'll take each in turn. First, organic growth is a critical part of any strategy, because it offers the most attractive and compelling value proposition on a risk-adjusted basis. We have the best geographic footprint in the industry and the best operators in the industry but we are not satisfied.  Our four strategic disciplines are designed to accelerate this organic growth strategy. And the benefits are clear as we grow our unit profitability. Second, we regularly review an active list of M&A targets. Last year the M&A market basically shut down. But it's reopened this year. We have a long history of making both large and small acquisitions when they are a good strategic fit. Since 2014, we've completed more than two dozen value-enhancing acquisitions in some of the fastest-growing markets in the country. And finally, we had a long and successful history of developing and opening new aggregate locations. This allows us to pinpoint the location of aggregates reserves in growth quarters where there is no acquisition opportunity. Additional benefits include more control over timing of capital investment and not paying a premium for the assets. We like having a balance between organic and inorganic growth. It provides a high degree of flexibility and is an important part of our capital allocation process and our ability to increase our return on invested capital. I'll now turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments. Suzanne Wood : Thanks Tom, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by highlighting four key areas to consider this quarter. Our aggregates unit profitability expansion, return on invested capital, balance sheet strength and the California land sale. First, unit profitability. Our aggregates gross profit per ton increased by 12% to $4.82. We believe this is important because improving the operational profitability of existing locations generally comes with limited capital investment as compared to other growth engines. When the improvements are both sustainable and widespread across the footprint, significant value is created. Our strategic disciplines are making an impact and we have a good track record of execution. Over the past three years our compound annual growth rate for gross profit per ton was 7%. The second key area is return on invested capital. As Tom mentioned, the 90 basis point improvement in the quarter pushed our return to 14.8% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. While a higher returns profile is always good, the way in which the improvement is achieved is also important. As an example, the first quarter's ROIC gain was comprised of a 1% increase in invested capital and a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This further highlights the importance of the unit profitability discussed earlier. Over the past three years, our trailing 12 months ROIC has improved by 280 basis points, driven by a 4% compound annual growth rate in invested capital and an 11% compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA. The third area is the balance sheet. Our balance sheet strength has created significant optionality and flexibility as we consider our capital allocation priorities, our balanced approach to growth and shareholder returns. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.4 times, and we have nearly $900 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our debt has a weighted average maturity of 15 years, with no significant maturities in the near-term. And as always, we will continue to operate the business for the long term. We will not rush decisions to invest, just because extra capital is available. The last of the four key areas, I wanted to highlight, was the sale of the reclaimed quarry in Southern California. The sale generated $182 million of net proceeds and a pre-tax gain of $115 million. One of the strengths of our aggregates-focused business are the multiple opportunities to create value, and the life cycle of this quarry demonstrates that well. Now so far on the call, we focused entirely on the aggregates business. So let's shift briefly to non-aggregates. Gross profit in those segments collectively was $5.6 million in the quarter or $2 million less than last year. The severe weather mentioned earlier affected both asphalt volumes in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas, and concrete volumes in Virginia. Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I'll touch briefly on two more topics; diesel fuel costs, and a change in our effective tax rate. With respect to the cost of diesel, it really wasn't much of a factor in the quarter, because the unit price of diesel was relatively unchanged from last year's first quarter. For the full year, we now anticipate that the cost of diesel fuel will be a headwind of approximately $25 million, reflecting higher prices since the start of the year. The last time we spoke with you we expected that our effective tax rate for 2021 would be 21%. We now expect the full year rate to be between 23% and 24%, following a 27% rate in the first quarter. The higher rate in Q1 and the revised expectation for the full year resulted from Alabama's recent change in the law, which modified the methodology by which a company apportions income to the state. This change had the effect of reducing our ability to fully utilize certain net operating loss carry-forwards in Alabama. And as a result, we recorded a $14 million charge in the first quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments. Tom Hill : Thank you, Suzanne. Before we go to Q&A, I want to again thank our employees for their hard work, for keeping each other safe, and for their dedication to servicing our customers, embracing our strategic disciplines, and making Vulcan better every day. We will continue to operate Vulcan for the long-term. This means, staying focused on our strong local execution, driving unit margin expansion, maintaining a strong financial position and improving our returns. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Good morning, everyone. Thank you guys for taking the call. Can you talk a little bit about what's happening on the cost structure? I mean going back to the Aggregates Day, you guys had a framework for volumes and EBITDA. Where you're tracking, kind of, the midpoint of the guide would imply that you're at least a year ahead of what you would talk about on the cost side. I don't know if that's just the last year pricing with COVID being the anomaly or something else that's driving it, but it is certainly nice to see. Thank you. Tom Hill : Yes. Good morning. It was an excellent operating quarter. The cost of -- cash cost was down 3% on flat production volumes. And what we're seeing Stanley is our operating disciplines at work. Most importantly, we kept our folks safe, but there were just good fundamental improvements in our key operating parameters, things like throughput plant availability, yield or labor and energy efficiencies. For example, I'll give you an example there 31 of our top 50 plants showed improvement in plant availability. And that's a big lever when it comes to cost. So my hat goes off to operators. Congratulations on a great start to the year. And we appreciate all the hard work, but it's a lot of smart work too. Suzanne Wood : Yes. And Stanley, I'd just add to that. We -- one of the themes of the Investor Day when we had it was that as Tom said we're going to focus on what we can control because you don't always have control over volumes and we certainly saw that in the last year with the pandemic and the uncertainty. So we've really pushed and our operators have embraced these operational efficiency initiatives and that discipline that Tom talked about. And that's really what you see coming through in the quarter because you should always have some measure of control over your cost. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research. Tom Hill : Good morning, Kathryn. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Kathryn Thompson : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions today. And 12 years ago today Tom, Suzanne we started TRG and you guys were our very first earnings call as a company. So happy birthday to TRG. Suzanne Wood : Outstanding. Kathryn Thompson : Switching to our DNA, which is infrastructure and public construction focus. Just one year after COVID began how would you describe state DOT health and outlook? And tying to that your thoughts on the infrastructure bill and the extension of the fab stat. What this means for Vulcan going forward? Tom Hill : Yes. So I would describe the state DOT budgets and lettings as simply back to normal. If you remember we saw a slowdown in lettings in the third quarter when revenues fell in Q2 of last year then lettings ramped back up in October and have stayed up. So the 2021 DOT budgets and lettings basically return to normal. You saw gas tax revenues return, you got the $10 billion of aid from the first COVID-19 relief packages. So basically 2021 back to normal. As we look forward to 2022 which in most states starts -- fiscal year starts July 1, it appears -- now they haven't finalized their budgets, but it appears the budgets again will be back to normal or as planned with overall growth. I would point out that four of our five top states will see funding growth we think in fiscal year 2022. So back to normal. On the highway bill, on the federal highway bill, I think, for me, the good news is, that our nation's infrastructure problem and potential solutions are on the front page of the paper every day. I think it's too early to say how much funding will be up. But regardless of whose plan you like, both plans show a considerable increase in funding for roads and bridges. And also, remember that in any definition of infrastructure, if its new construction, aggregates is going to be in the foundation. So it will help us, whether it's roads and bridges or other forms of infrastructure. So the bottom line is that we are -- I think we're likely to see an infrastructure package get done by the end of the year, with substantially increase in funding. And again, going back to your first question, don't forget that the state funding is up and will continue to get better. So, it looks like a bright future from an infrastructure perspective. Kathryn Thompson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Tom Hill : Good morning, Jerry. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Jatin Khanna : Good morning, everyone. This is Jatin Khanna on behalf of Jerry Revich. We are hearing in other industries that concerns over drastically higher capital gains taxes are driving private players to the market this year. Are you seeing that dynamic play out? And can you also update us on your M&A pipeline overall? Tom Hill : I'm sorry, I think, your question was about capital gains taxes. It was -- the connection wasn't great. Jatin Khanna : Yes. So we are hearing in other industries that concerns over drastically higher capital gains taxes are driving private sellers to the market this year. Are you seeing that dynamic play out? And I also asked that, can you update us on your M&A pipeline overall. Suzanne Wood : Sure. I'll let Tom comment on the update on the M&A pipeline. But with respect to whether or not capital gains tax and the potential changes proposed by the Biden Administration are driving sellers to the market, I mean that's something that you often hear come up as tax law potentially changes and as there's a pickup in M&A activity. In our view I mean it's possible. I certainly wouldn't say that it would have no impact. But in our experience, we typically see the driver, I mean, particularly in some of the small bolt-on acquisitions, as being sort of generational changes with ownership, as certain of the business leaders that have been running some of these smaller to mid-sized businesses decide that they want to have a look at succession planning, are their children going to be involved in the business, et cetera. We see that as the more typical driver of a potential seller into the M&A market. Tom Hill : Yes, I don't think it will have a big impact on M&A. I mean, M&As picked up, but I don't think that's the catalyst. Jatin Khanna : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Tom Hill : Good morning, Garik. Garik Shmois : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to understand the guidance raise a little bit better. How much of the guidance is related to the 1Q strength, maybe relative to your initial plan? And then you did take up your volume outlook, but you also took up the view of diesel costs. So should we think of those two netting out the rest of the year. So, I guess, just trying to understand what's incremental in the overall EBITDA guidance this year relative to the 1Q performance. Tom Hill : Well, I think the volume -- I'll address volume, it was up obviously 3%. It was driven by the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. I think that at the end of the day, works just returning faster than we had expected. You heard us say on our February call that the big unknown in 2021 would be how quickly the jobs start back up. Good news is, it started faster than anticipated really in the non-residential and highway sector, and those were the big unknowns for us. So, as we got a little more clarity to that and how fast jobs are starting and what our backlog look like, it gave us confidence that we could up our volume guidance. So that was -- it was just -- the work -- we knew the work was there. It was how fast \u2013 how fast was it going to come back, and it just came back faster than we had expected. I think if you look at the cost guidance and there right now, we would say, low-single-digit built in our projection. That includes -- I think what you're seeing there is the inflationary pressures. Obviously, we call it out fuel. I think we have been around $10 million or so. We're now at $25 million and that's simply the price of diesel went up. So, the goal with cost is always flat costs. And I know our operators have a passion to do that and we think we can beat inflation. But right now, I think, we're -- that's our best estimate on cost to be low-single-digit. Suzanne Wood : Yes, Garik, I'll just add something with respect to the volume guidance. As Tom said, when we last spoke to you in February, it really was around the fact that we wanted a bit more visibility around starts and what was coming in the market, because we were still a bit early in the process. And so, it really for us was a combination of seeing the growth in the first quarter. As Tom said, some of those postponed jobs starting to come back online, input from our customers what we were seeing across the footprint in all the markets, but also from a macro perspective, we have a number of leading indicators we looked at, that are all turning in the positive direction. And just, as examples, we look at construction, unemployment. We look at ABI, the index, as kind of a trend indicator, even though it can be volatile month-to-month. We are a big believer in Dodge starts on a total dollars basis. That's growing again in our markets, and we also look at the Dodge Momentum Index, which is sort of an indicator for non-res. So, when you put all that together, including our own internal metrics, it gave us the confidence to look at what happened in the first quarter and take that forward based on some of those indicators that I mentioned. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets. Tom Hill : Good morning. Mike Dahl : \u2026 for taking my question. Suzanne, I actually just wanted to follow-up on the volume questions and maybe Tom as well. I understand that 1Q is seasonally a relatively small quarter for you, but given the strength to start the year, some easier comps over the next couple of quarters and your comments about the moment in the business. The low-end of that volume guide actually still seems fairly conservative. Can you just walk through kind of why wouldn't volume be even stronger at this point given what you're talking about and maybe some of the puts and takes you could elaborate on? Suzanne Wood : Sure. No, it's a very good question. I mean you've heard us say this lots of times. I mean we always try to be thoughtful in our guidance. We like to give a range and then talk about what would put you at the lower end of the range or what might happen and put you at the upper end of the range. And as always, when we look at that lower end of the range the plus one on volume, I mean it's really driven by your comment. I mean look, it's first quarter. That's typically the smallest quarter. It's seasonally affected. And when you look out toward third quarter you do have the severe weather events that could potentially have some impact. So we want to be a bit cautious about that. On the higher side of the volume, the plus 4% again -- if we see the starts and other work opportunities, job opportunities out there come to pass I mean we could definitely be at that level. So it's really around non-res and just exactly how quickly that comes back. So could we be a bit better? I guess possibly. But I think that for now based on what we know and what we see in all those internal and external indicators, we are comfortable with the one to four range. I think we thoughtfully considered everything we know and I think it's exactly the right place for us to be as we sit here on May 4. And as we look forward in second quarter look, we'll have a look and see where we are then. But I think it's important not to get ahead of ourselves and it's a quarter-by-quarter process of looking at it. Mike Dahl : Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Tom Hill : Good morning, Trey. Trey Grooms : Thanks for taking my question. So I guess on pricing here you mentioned that pricing improved sequentially in March and you expect this to continue through the year. And you also increased your outlook for diesel costs this year which typically leads to more pricing. So similar to Mike's question a minute ago on the volume, is there opportunity for pricing to maybe move to the higher end or maybe even above the higher end of the range that -- you didn't adjust the pricing range of up 2% to 4%, but is there - could there be opportunity there? And how should we be thinking about the price cadence given the timing of fixed price -- excuse me fixed plant pricing? Is there step functions, or would it be fairly linear as we look through the year? Tom Hill : So Trey you called it out. Always, if you look at inflationary pressures and diesel coupled with better visibility to rising demand that's always good for price. And I mean that's like two of the fundamentals things that are really good for price. So I'd call pricing in the quarter as expected. Q1 we're working off work that we bid in the middle of pandemic, when price increases were not as robust because of uncertainty, and there's a lot of uncertainty if you think back a year. And as we said in Q2 we would accelerate prices through the year. Our April fixed plant prices are now in effect and went as expected. So prices will continue to grow through the year. And that's what we expected. And that's what we're seeing. I do think that pricing will -- as you say will climb, due to both, fuel and inflation and demand returning. Our bid work pricing is moving up faster now, because of inflationary pressures particularly diesel and logistics challenges. And then, we're now having more conversations about a second price increase or a mid-year price increase, depending on the market with our customers. And they get that based on both, fuel and inflationary pressures. And I would like to say, their profitabilities are now -- their bid work is -- their price is going up because of both the same thing both, inflationary pressures and visibility to demand. At the same time, and we all know that pricing is critical for all of us, but at the same time, remember, it's only part of the unit margin arithmetic. Unit margin is still the most important metric. And I believe, our teams have done a really good job implementing those four strategic disciplines. Our cash gross profit per ton went up by 9% in the quarter. And that's a good job. Because it was a combination of volume, price and cost. Trey Grooms : Yeah. Thank you for the color, Tom. I appreciate it. And best of luck. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Keith Hughes of Truist. Keith Hughes : Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked. But I just want to turn back to the nonresidential comments. You've given some color of -- in the industry, what kind of projects could be coming. I guess my question given the outlook and the type of projects are there variability in terms of when those actually become shipments for you whether it's a data center versus an office building? And any kind of aggregate intensity that you would find amongst those different projects that could be coming in the market? Tom Hill : Yeah that's insightful. So non-res is definitely improving. And as you point out, it's led by the e-commerce, and warehouses, and distribution centers and that heavy part of non-residential construction is more aggregate-intensive just because, it's flat. And there's a lot of flat work. And so the aggregate intensity is higher. But what's interesting in what we're seeing in that heavy side is those jobs are going faster. So the time from when they're let or when their bid to the time they're working, is much faster than what we traditionally see in non-res. And that was a little bit of the change in our outlook for the year. We saw those non-res jobs just starting faster than we expected. Now, we're also seeing jobs that were postponed in the pandemic start again -- start up. And you couple that with -- we're starting to see green shoots on traditional non-res that's following subdivision construction. So in general non-res is on the min. But to your point, the heavy side is more aggregate-intensive and it does tend to start faster. Keith Hughes : Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Josh Wilson of Raymond James. Josh Wilson : Good morning, Tom, Suzanne. Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Josh Wilson : Most of my questions have been answered as well, but on the inflation side of things, could you also address maybe what you're seeing on the labor side and also in asphalt costs? Tom Hill : Yeah. So while our market outlook is really exciting with the growth from a volume perspective, there's always there's going to be challenges and right now it's inflationary pressures, labor and logistics. And we're addressing these now. And our four strategic disciplines will allow us to mitigate these challenges faster. And I'll take them in turn. Inflation, the aggregates business has the ability to beat inflation for a couple of reasons. It allows us an avenue for price and we own \u2013 our largest cost, which is the rock in the ground. And we believe that our good operating efficiencies supported by our operating disciplines will help offset inflation. Labor, again our operating excellence program improves efficiencies. But also we've really accelerated employee training and development. And that retains employees, that attracts employees and gets new employees up to speed faster, which is very important and keeps them safe. And then on the logistics front, if you remember future truck shortages were one of the catalysts behind our logistics innovation efforts. And that allows us to truck more efficiently and we can beat those challenges actually with technology-driven efficiencies. So our \u2013 those are four strategic disciplines are designed to take advantage of tailwinds but also to dampen the effects of headwinds, so that we can live up to the potential for our shareholders. And I think that's what you'll see over the next year. We'll take advantage of the volume and potentially pricing tailwinds but will offset the headwinds of inflation, labor and logistic challenges. Josh Wilson : Thanks. Good luck with the next quarter.\\ Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Tom Hill : Good morning. Collin Verron : Hi. This is actually, Collin Verron on for Phil. A great start to the year. Thank you for taking my question. So you called out cost control as a driver of gross profit margin and unit margin improvement in the ags business in the quarter. Just given the increase in volumes and pricing you're expecting, as well as your outlook for higher diesel fuel costs, can you provide color on how you're thinking about the year-over-year change in aggregates gross margins and unit margins through the remainder of the year? Tom Hill : Yes. So I would probably call out in the range of mid-single digit. And if you put that together that meets our range in price that's out there. I would call out probably low single-digit \u2013 flat to low single-digit in cost. And at this point we think all that's achievable. Collin Verron : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Tom, Mark, Suzanne. Tom Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Tom, I was intrigued about your comments about your balanced look at allocation and talking about the greenfield opportunities. Maybe you could share a little bit more on timing. What's in like current plan in your CapEx budget for this? Are the projects \u2013 I assume they're much longer dated size, scale, of what could happen? And is there anything that's imminent that you're looking at that would require over the next several years your quite a bit of capital to boomers or a lot of opportunities? Just want to get a sense of how you're thinking that when you balance it relative to your organic and certainly the M&A opportunities? Tom Hill : Yes. So if you just step back and look at growth, if you remember in 2020, the M&A growth really dried up. We've seen a marked pickup in 2021. And as always, we're going to be both opportunistic and disciplined about our approach to acquisitions. It's got to fit us. So when it comes to growth, I'd actually take a broader view as you talked about and look at Vulcan's ability to grow. And it's unique because it's balanced. And then there's -- we talked about the three avenues. One was acquisitions. And look, we're the largest most probable aggregates producer we're going to get the call, when it's something for sale, but we have to be disciplined and we have to do the work to pay the right price for the right assets.  Number two would be opening Greenfield facilities and -- Greenfield is opening a new facility. Greenfield is a -- it's difficult to do and requires a lot of hard, smart work. You have to go out and define the growth quarters. You have to overlay that with geology. You have to go procure the land, you have to get the permits. And then you have to build the right facility at the right time. And the reason for that Greenfields are so important is that, as you look at the growth quarter, there may not be an acquisition target available to best supply that growth quarter hence the Greenfield. But just -- you have to have the know-how and it's hard to do and you have to do the hard work. There's nothing easy about it and you have to time it right.  And then the last in the third quarter we talked about was organic growth. And you've heard me talk endlessly about our four strategic disciplines and we're excited about them because they're important. And this has to be done with its design and planning and discipline. And it's important because it's -- from a shareholder's perspective because it's lower risk and higher returns. And for us it's working. You look at our numbers over the last couple of years, you see us accelerate our growth in unit margins. And so that balanced approach for us is so important. And don't forget that we also have the balance sheet to execute on this. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Tom. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Timna Tanners of Bank of America. Timna Tanners : Good morning, guys. Tom Hill : Good morning, Timna. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Timna Tanners : I wanted to ask two questions. One was on -- just you did highlight that the infrastructure proposals as they stand both focus on increased spending on roads. But one thing we struggled with is trying to understand some of the auxiliary spending and especially in the Biden proposal and what that might mean for aggregates, if you've done any work on that or have any thoughts. So in either proposal what that might mean? And the second question is, if you have any updated information for us on how the Board is looking at the dividend? I know you just raised it, but just any new thoughts there would be great? Tom Hill : Yes. So I'll talk about highways and let Suzanne talk about dividend. I think that what's important in infrastructure and I said this when we talked about the highway bill. In the Biden plan, anything that is new construction you have to have aggregates in the foundation. And now obviously, we love roads and highways because they're most aggregate-intensive. But anything that is new construction, you got to have aggregates in it. So if you look at alternative energy solutions, we're actually a big provider for the foundations for alternative energy, which has been a good business for us for years, so we welcome that also. Suzanne Wood : Timna, I'll just address the dividend question. Look, the dividend is very important to us and it's very important to our shareholders and we want to make absolutely certain that we maintain the dividend. It's a very good way of increasing shareholder returns. And as you noted, I mean, the company has continued to increase that year-over-year. And as we've said, it is -- we think about it in almost a progressive kind of way. And by that I mean, we will continue to grow the dividend at the Board's discretion to a level that we are absolutely certain that we can maintain through the cycle, because what we absolutely do not want to do is have shifts and changes in that dividend. So when you're talking about an ordinary dividend, the ability to maintain that level is absolutely critical, and that's what we're focused on. When you look at our cash-generation capabilities if you look at our operating cash flows over the trailing 12 months, cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion. That's up about 20% year-over-year. So I think you can tell by the strong cash generation capabilities that we have that we should -- again at the Board's discretion, but we should be in a position to continue the view I just described on dividend growth. Timna Tanners : Yes. Absolutely. It's a high quality problem, but your share price is going up so strongly means that the dividend yield is being kind of small. Suzanne Wood : Yes. Timna Tanners : So here you're pointing through the cycle. But the free cash flow has been pretty steady now actually even through this latest correction, so curious on that. And, I guess, you didn't have -- oh, I'm sorry go ahead. Suzanne Wood : No, I was just going to say you're right. It is a quality problem to have. I mean, what we've been very focused on with our disciplines, and focus on unit profitability, et cetera is making sure that that free cash flow is stable, it's increasing because when you have a high degree of confidence in your free cash flow generation then you can do good things with your capital allocation priorities. And that was really the first step and I think we've accomplished that and we'll look forward for additional opportunities to improve the company's ROIC. Timna Tanners : Okay. Fair. And Tom on the question I had earlier, is there anything that you can provide in terms of rule of thumb in terms of green energy? I mean, offshore I imagine is less than certainly some of the solar and onshore wind. But is there anything about aggregates per project or anything that you can provide for us in terms of guidance? Tom Hill : It's hard to do a rule of thumb. I would just say that the wind energy is very aggregate-intensive, because you're not just putting in the foundations which are massive for those wind mills you're also putting all the logistics network all the roads and utilities for those wind mills. So it's -- the wind energy is very aggregate-intensive. Timna Tanners : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Tom Hill : Good morning, Adam. Adam Thalhimer : Good morning. Good morning guys. A great start to the year. I guess, my biggest question Tom would just be on aggregates pricing. And there's so much inflation throughout the entire construction chain right now. I mean, when do you think we break out of this low single-digit range that we've been in for a while for aggregates pricing? Tom Hill : I think you'll see us march that up as we progress through the year. I think we get the question a lot of times can you get to double-digit price increases and I think\u2026 Adam Thalhimer : Yes, yes, yes. That's what I want to know. Tom Hill : So to answer the question we have the history will tell you, yes, and we have done it before. I think --but you got to -- you guys see an average of some 60 markets pricing all put together, and each market marches to a different cadence. And so what we'll do is we'll push price really hard in the market for a while, and then you may have to pause, and let folks, catch up and then you'll push it again. And to get to that double-digit number all the stars have to line up at once. Can that happen? Yes. Would I advise that? No. So -- but I would say this much. The pricing environment has improved dramatically. And as I said a little bit earlier, you got both demand visibility and you've got -- now you've got inflationary pressures both of which are good for pricing. So we'll plug at it all year. I think -- and obviously we'll -- we get towards the end of the year, we'll have a better view for 2022. And don't forget, as we said, we're still working off some work that we bid in the middle of the pandemic when price increases were not as healthy as they are today. So we'll get past that and we'll plow. But yes, we would love to see double-digit pricing. I would also tell you that's very hard to do, not impossible, but very difficult. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. Thank you very much. Tom Hill : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Hi, good morning. Tom Hill : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : You talked about the guidance raise being partly driven by job shipping and starting faster than expected. I'm just wondering if that was really pronounced or concentrated in any specific state or end market? And just generally, how the 2021 volume growth outlook for ags maybe breaks out between your end markets? Tom Hill : I think that if you look at really what's happening in the end markets, it's pretty normalized across our footprint. You've got residential which is very, very good. You got non-res which is returning driven by the heavy side. We're starting to see green shoots on the light side. On highways, the jobs that will bid and the fourth quarter just have returned faster. Remember, Q3 was down as the DOTs were trying to start the year and see what was going to happen. And then infrastructure, non-highway infrastructure, I would call it flat to improving. You had pressures from revenues, but they've come back and you've got COVID relief that will kick in probably by the end of this year beginning of next year. I think that if I've had to pick a market, I'd say the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states were the strongest. You had Illinois down and Texas down and Northern California down. That was really weather-driven. I mean cold frigid weather in Texas and then -- and Illinois and wet weather in Northern California. So if I had to pick areas, it would be the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, but I would tell you that the quarter was more -- the volumes were down were more weather-driven not demand driven. And I would call out improving in all of our markets. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I'll turn it over. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Paul Roger of Exane. Tom Hill : Good morning. Paul Roger : Hi, Suzanne. Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Hi. Good morning. Paul Roger : So I've just got one question then. It's maybe slightly less feel compared to the rest of the Q&A. And it's basically looking at the environmental agenda and the fact that that's obviously going up in the US. Can you talk a bit about the risk and opportunities that brings? And maybe specifically what impact would the increase use of recycled aggregates have on Vulcan? Tom Hill : If you look at the environmental piece for Vulcan, we've been doing this a long time and been doing it well for a long time. But if you step back and just look at for example greenhouse gas, our effect for us the -- our greenhouse gas emissions are actually for a construction materials company very low. And we're -- even with that being said, we are improving our footprint. We are looking at renewable energies. We're also -- we're probably about -- 25% of our mobile equipment has the new engines in it which have less emissions and we will plug-in that every year to improve it. So I think we've got a great story to tell. I think we're -- but even that being said, we're working hard to improve it. Paul Roger : And on the recycled aggregates side, I mean, that was one of the things we saw when the green agenda really took off in Europe. Presumably that's negative for virgin aggregates and potentially margin is it? Tom Hill : Yeah. So if you're referring to recycle, we are a big recycler. We, obviously, are in the concrete-recycling business. We're also -- with our asphalt business we're a big recycler of asphalt. So it is part of our makeup and it is growing. Suzanne Wood : And I would just -- yeah, I would just add to that, Paul that in terms of highways, the formulas that are used for the asphalt there, it varies by state but you're only able to use a certain amount of recycled material there. So you have to be cautious as to what you're doing and we're very happy as Tom indicated to be in the recyclable business, but it is not a replacement for virgin asphalt in many of the applications. Paul Roger : Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Zane Karimi of D.A. Davidson. Zane Karimi : Thanks for the color so far. I was just hoping to go into a little more detail on your outlook in particularly what you're seeing in California and Texas. Like what is driving activity in these markets? And how is your outlook -- how has it really changed from last quarter to this? And are you seeing stronger drivers in infrastructure or nonresi for a potential upside from here? Tom Hill : For both of them, I would tell you we are seeing growth. Remember California if you -- California first. 2020 was a really difficult year in California. You had the pandemic. Northern California was the most severe shelter in place. On top of that you had the rolling power outages from the fires, which caused severe cement shortages. I would tell cost of cement tied in California but nothing like it was last year. So much improvement in California just from ability to do business. It's opened up and you don't have rolling power outages or cement shortages. But that being said, highways are up, residential is up and strong, nonres is improving and infrastructure is recovering both with revenues coming back and with COVID relief help. Texas, obviously, a rough start with the frigid weather in Texas. But that -- putting that aside highways are very strong in Texas. Res is very strong in Texas. Nonres is improving, again driven by the heavy. And the non-infrastructure is also improving. So both in California and Texas, we see much improved markets and ability to do business. Zane Karimi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Tom for any additional or closing remarks. Tom Hill : Yeah. Thank you very much for your time and interest in Vulcan this morning. We'll continue to make good progress on our long-term goals and we look forward to sharing the news with you over the quarter and for quarters to come. Have a nice day and stay healthy and safe. Suzanne Wood : Bye. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Christie, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our website, vulcanmaterials.com. A recording of this call will be available for replay later today at our website. Please be reminded that today\u2019s discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company\u2019s earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation and other SEC filings. As the operator indicated, please limit your Q&A participation to one question. This will help maximize our time together. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope that you and your families continued to be safe and healthy. I want to begin today\u2019s call by taking a moment to congratulate our team for their solid execution during the first half of the year. Our performance through the first two quarters further demonstrates the strength of our aggregates-led business. We expect the momentum we generated in the first half of the year to carry through the second half. And we reiterate our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.46 billion. For the first half of the year, our adjusted EBITDA increased by 7% and our aggregate cash gross profit per ton expanded by 5% through a combination of volume growth, higher pricing and improved operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $406 million essentially unchanged versus the same quarter last year. We achieved this result despite a $25 million headwind from much higher diesel and liquid asphalt costs. Diesel costs rose by $15 million in the quarter, liquid asphalt costs were $10 million higher than the same period last year. And together with wet weather, negatively impacted the profitability of our non-aggregate segments. Even after considering the energy headwind, our aggregate cash gross profit per ton grew by 2% in the quarter due to our team\u2019s consistent execution of our four strategic disciplines. With a 4% increase in aggregates volume in the second quarter, and the market\u2019s current visibility to demand, the pricing environment continues to improve. Freight adjusted aggregates pricing increased 3% in the quarter and the rate of growth improved sequentially throughout the quarter. Adjusted for mix, freight adjusted price improved 2.6% twice the growth rate realized in the first quarter. Along with improved volume and pricing, operating efficiencies and cost control helped to offset inflationary pressures. Our total cash cost of sales increased by 4% in the quarter versus the prior year. Excluding the diesel headwinds, cash costs of sales grew by less than 1%. During the second half of the year, we will remain diligent and focus on controlling what we can control and on driving further improvements in our profitability. The solid aggregates performance helped to offset reduce profitability in the non-aggregate segment. Our second quarter non-aggregates gross profit declined year-over-year due primarily to the higher liquid asphalt costs, which I mentioned earlier and lower volumes in both asphalt and concrete. Wet weather impacted asphalt shipments, while the shift in timing of projects, particularly in Virginia, resulted in lower than anticipated concrete shipments. Turning now to the demand picture. It has improved across our major end markets, as well as geographies. The residential end use has shown continued strength with solid starts in single-family housing. We\u2019ve also seen an uptick in multi-family housing starts. Now with respect to the non-residential outlook, improvement continues in a number of leading indicators, and we have begun to see month over month improvement in starts. The strongest non-residential sector continues to be the work-related to e-commerce and technology infrastructure, but lighter traditional non-residential demand is also recovering. The level how we starts remained healthy in the first half of 2021, as states got back to normal funding and budget levels. On the broader subject of federal highway and infrastructure spending, we\u2019re encouraged by the progress made toward a highway bill with substantially higher funding over the FAST Act levels. We\u2019ve also seen an acceleration of starts in public infrastructure such as water and sewer treatment systems, airports, and storm and flood control. Before turning the call over to Suzanne, I want to briefly touch on our growth strategy and the recently announced agreement to acquire U.S. Concrete. We have three paths to growth, and it\u2019s important to strike the right balance between these three in order to drive higher returns. Those paths are organic growth, greenfields and M&A. We always start with organic growth because it offers the most attractive and compelling value proposition on a risk adjusted basis. We have a unique and irreplaceable asset-based spread across the most attractive geographies in the U.S. Our four strategic disciplines are designed to accelerate our organic growth and the benefits are clear as we expand our unit profitability. We also have a long and successful history of developing and opening new aggregate locations, particularly in growth quarters, where acquisition opportunities may be limited. We like the flexibility that greenfields provide in regards to timing and pace of capital spending. Our third growth engine is M&A, U.S. Concrete is a great strategic fit for Vulcan, as it naturally complements our existing aggregates business. It also brings new geographic exposure to the company. Expanding and diversifying our already strong footprint into the Northeast. Along with my colleagues at both Vulcan and U.S. Concrete, I\u2019m very excited about the potential for this combination. It will allow us to further drive sustainable long-term shareholder value, and I\u2019ll look forward to welcoming the U.S. Concrete team to the Vulcan family. Now I will turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments. Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Tom. And good morning to everyone. I\u2019d like to begin by highlighting a few key areas to consider this quarter, our aggregates price realization, unit profitability, return on invested capital and balance sheet strength. First, our ability to consistently deliver compounding price improvements is an important driver of our unit margins. The current pricing environment is positive due to improving demand visibility and inflationary pressures. We\u2019ve seen attractive sequential improvement in pricing through the first half of the year and we expect the momentum to carry over to the second half. Clearly these compounding price improvements along with good operational execution are having a positive impact on our unit profitability. This quarter marked the 12th straight quarter of improvement in our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton. For the trailing 12 months cash gross profit per ton was $7.26 and for the quarter it was $7.83 per ton moving ever closer to our current goal of $9 per ton. The next area of focus is our return on invested capital. We are pleased with our improving returns and on a trailing 12-month basis, return on invested capital was 14.8%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to the prior year period. This improvement was comprised of an essentially unchanged invested capital base and a 4% increase in trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. And finally, we will continue to prioritize our balance sheet strength to create the flexibility and optionality necessary to support our capital allocation strategy. At June 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3 times, reflecting $968 million of cash on hand. Our debt has a weighted average maturity of 15 years with no significant maturities in the near-term. It\u2019s important to note that even after the anticipated close of the U.S. Concrete acquisition, our balance sheet will be in good standing and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. Before turning the call back over to Tom, I do want to touch briefly on two housekeeping matters. First, you will have noted an increase in our interest expense this quarter, concurrent with the announced pending acquisition of U.S. Concrete in June, we obtained a bridge facility commitment to support the deal. Subsequently, we executed a $1.6 billion delayed draw term loan, which will be used to fund the acquisition along with cash on hand, borrowings under that facility are due three years from the funding date. And so this facility will be used as an interim measure prior to accessing the bond market at the appropriate time. As a result, financing costs of $9 million for the bridge commitment was recognized as expense in the second quarter. The final matter to mention is our effective tax rate. And as a reminder, at the end of first quarter, we increased our expectation of the full year rate to between 23% and 24%, that guidance is still applicable. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thanks Suzanne. Before we go to Q&A, I want to again thank the entire Vulcan team for their hard work and their dedication to serving our customers, our people are what makes Vulcan better every day. I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t comment on the current COVID environment and the recent announcement by the CDC in response to the surge in the Delta variants. We will continue to closely monitor the spread of the virus, ensuring the health and safety of our employees and their families. We will continue to operate Vulcan for the long-term, this means keeping our people safe and healthy, staying focused on strong local execution, driving unit margin expansion and improving our financial returns. And now we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Trey Grooms : Hey, good morning, everyone. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Tom Hill : Good morning, Trey. Trey Grooms : So, Tom, your aggregates business clearly performed well given some of the headwinds. Obviously, asphalt is facing some challenges right now on the cost front. But as we look into the back half of the year, can you help us unpack some of the puts and takes around the guidance, specifically around these different segments? Thank you. Tom Hill : Sure. As you heard us say, we\u2019re confident in the full year guidance of $1.38 billion to 1.46 billion, which \u2013 remember, we raised that 90 days ago, as you said, probably with a little bit different puts and takes. We probably won\u2019t make up, or won\u2019t be able to make up the shortfall in other aggregates, which is really asphalt. As you know, we\u2019re playing catch up on liquid costs. Now I would say to that asphalt prices are going up and we\u2019ll see increased prices and probably improved margins in the second half, but probably not enough to offset all the liquid headwinds. That being said, aggregate volumes appear to be improving with demand improving in all market end uses. So I\u2019d call it asphalt being offset by shipping on the higher side of our volume midpoint. So aggregates, we\u2019re on the optimistic side of volume. Prices in aggregates, we reiterate the 2% to 4% range, although we\u2019re seeing prices improving sequentially. From a cost perspective, we would still say that over the 12 months we\u2019ll be low-single digits, so good operating disciplines. Unit margin in the mid-single-digit range. Non-aggregates a little lower, but improving, which brings me to, I\u2019d say confidence in that $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion guidance. Trey Grooms : Great. Perfect. That\u2019s great color. Thanks for the thoughts, Tom, and take care. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thanks, Trey. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question, and nice work in a very tough environment. Tom, can you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing on the price side of the equation? You mentioned sequentially improving, you\u2019ve got the demand commentary, which looks encouraging into the back half of the year and into next year. Just curious to see what\u2019s happening on the ground in terms of the pricing dynamics. Thank you. Tom Hill : Sure, and good morning, Stanley. Yes. When you have \u2013 we have visibility to growing demand like we have right now and you couple that with pressures from fuel and other inflationary pressures, we know that prices will accelerate. They\u2019re probably accelerating a little faster than maybe we anticipated 90 days ago and it\u2019s probably a little brighter. At this point, I think we\u2019d be premature to adjust our 2021 pricing outlook, but I think it bodes very well for pricing in 2022. As we said, in the first quarter call, as we called out, the rate of price increases continues to escalate sequentially over time, we saw that in the quarter. We talked about, I mean, if you mix adjust price in the second quarter, it doubles over the first quarter. And then if you look within the second quarter, prices increased sequentially month to month. I think that we\u2019ll see \u2013 continue to see that sequential rate growth pattern throughout 2021. And I would expect it to \u2013 that sequential improvement to continue in 2022, although maybe a little higher amplitude and here\u2019s why. We started talking about \u2013 to our customers about second half price increases in May. On bid work, which is about 6% of our work. We have definitely increased price increases over the last 60 days on new jobs. Now, remember, there\u2019s a lag between that bid work. They won\u2019t ship for roughly six to nine months. When it comes to fixed plants, we\u2019ve had discussions, having discussions about second half price increases, and we\u2019ve realized those in a few markets. But in our conversations with customers, they\u2019ve been very positive, again, all supported by that clear visibility to growing demand and inflationary pressures. So while we see some benefit to 2021, this is definitely going to be a 2022 impact because those jobs that we bid now or bid over the last couple of months are definitely going to benefit 2022, and we\u2019ll see a bigger impact on fixed plant prices in 2022. Again, I think I would expect to see that rate of price increases continue to climb sequentially this year, and that pattern to continue to \u2013 into 2022. So this is just a really good environment for pricing. Stanley Elliott : Great, guys. Thank you very much. Best of luck. Tom Hill : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari : Hi, good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : Tom, is the decision to acquire U.S. Concrete a function of a more optimistic view on volumes over the next three to five years, maybe consistent with what we\u2019re hearing from D.C. on infrastructure? I mean you\u2019ve talked about the attractiveness of the assets. I\u2019m just wondering why now is sort of the right time to pursue the acquisition. Has market structure gotten better? Or are you more optimistic on end-market demand? Just wondering if you can give any more color there. Tom Hill : Well, as you know, usually when one of those happens, it\u2019s a long-term view, and it takes a long term to make one of those happen. So as you know, we\u2019ve been talking for a while and thinking about it for a while and working with U.S. Concrete. I think if you step back with it, obviously, market demand is \u2013 looks good for the short-term. But again, you do one of these, it\u2019s both short-term and long-term. And for both companies\u2019 shareholders, I think it was a good deal. If you step back and look, the geography works, both in California and Texas and in Virginia, and it introduces us to some really good positions and attractive new markets in New York and New Jersey. The aggregates \u2013 their aggregates and ready-mixed assets are very attractive. I think it\u2019s a well-run company. Their cultures are very much like ours. And I think the deal is progressing nicely, and we look forward to getting their team into the Vulcan family. We know them. They\u2019re talented and we just think it\u2019s very complementary. And the fact that the short-term markets look very good is another benefit. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Benjamin Burud : Hey, everyone. This is Benjamin Burud on behalf of Jerry Revich. The balance sheet is projected to be in great shape post the U.S. Concrete acquisition. How would you characterize the M&A pipeline and the opportunity set from them? Tom Hill : Yes. I think that the M&A pipeline continues to be good, and it\u2019s active. I\u2019d say, a lot more smaller targets, more bolt-ons. We have the balance sheet to be able to do what we want to do or need to do there. But as always, I think you have to be disciplined about those and what markets do you want to be in and what synergies are unique to us, don\u2019t overpay. And when you get them, make sure you integrate them fast and accurately. So there\u2019s a lot out there, but we\u2019ll be disciplined how \u2013 we have the firepower, but we\u2019ll be disciplined in how we look at them. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Keith Hughes of Truist. Keith Hughes : Thank you. You referred earlier in the call to $15 million of diesel inflation. I think that was the second quarter number. If you could talk about what that figure will look like in the third, I assume it\u2019s probably going to go up some given where diesel has moved. And then maybe even in the fourth, how it\u2019s going to affect the rest of the year? Tom Hill : Yes. I think we saw $15 million impact on diesel 16 \u2013 for the quarter, $16.5 million. So it was really a Q2 impact. I think the second quarter will be the hardest hit for the year by diesel. And if you remember, last year\u2019s diesel in the second quarter, maybe, I think it was under $1. So just if you look at comparables, this will be the toughest hit. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen with diesel prices, but our best outlook would tell you the impact of the $20 to $25 range in the second half. That being said, I think we\u2019re comfortable with our operating efficiencies to be able to only have low single-digit cost climb for the full year, which, right now, we\u2019re under 1%. Suzanne Wood : Yes. I think that was $20 million to $25 million in the second half. Keith Hughes : Okay. Thank you. And if I could sneak one more on U.S. Concrete. Any kind of narrow timeframe when you think the deal will close? Tom Hill : Second half, at this point. I mean it\u2019s going along well, but those are hard to predict. So I\u2019d just tell you second half. Keith Hughes : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Thompson : Hi. Thank you for taking my question today. Could you clarify how much of price controls versus pricing play into your expectations? And are you seeing \u2013 are there certain geographic areas where you\u2019re seeing greater relative strength over there, greater opportunities in light of both price and cost controls? Thank you. Tom Hill : I\u2019m sorry, Kathryn, I couldn\u2019t hear the first part of that question. Kathryn Thompson : Yes. Could you clarify how much of price controls versus pricing have played into your expectations, not just for 2021 but into 2022? And what geographic markets are you seeing greater relative upside? And are there greater opportunities for pricing there, but also other operational efficiencies that maybe didn\u2019t present themselves to the same degree earlier this year? Tom Hill : Yes. I think that if you step back and look at all of this, the pricing environment is as good as we\u2019ve seen it in a while. Now you\u2019ve got temporary inflationary pressures with diesel, but that is good for pricing because it allows you to have the ability to raise prices, particularly with the advantage by being what it is. And I think with good cost control, I think we\u2019re confident with that mid-single-digit unit margin improvement. From a pricing from a geographic perspective, it\u2019s really widespread. We raised bid prices across our footprint over the last two months. I think that the second half fixed plant price increases, a few places in the Southeast. But it\u2019s \u2013 that will really be more of a 2022 play with hopefully higher amplitude on pricing and maybe earlier in the year. So you got temporary pressures from inflation, but really a good setup from \u2013 for prices moving forward. And I think that we\u2019ve got a pretty good proven record on cost control to offset inflationary pressures, and we\u2019ll catch up with diesel even on cost control. Suzanne Wood : Yes, Kathryn, I would just add to that, look, when you look at the performance in the second quarter and also in the first half, certainly, very good from a pricing perspective, as Tom said, which was expected. But despite the diesel headwinds, we also had a very good cash cost performance as well. Cash cost of sales was up 4% in the quarter. But if you back diesel out of that, which rose significantly and rapidly, our expenses were less than 1% rise year-over-year. So we certainly experienced some inflation in other parts of the business and other input products besides diesel. But again, we had sufficient operating efficiencies and cost control to hold those cash costs to within less than 1%. And so if you have the combination of good pricing discipline and those rises we\u2019ve talked about, and we have good control over cost, which is one thing that we should be able to fully control, then you get the good results in cash gross profit per ton that we talked about. In Tom\u2019s comments, he called out that cash gross profit per ton was up 2%. If you exclude diesel from that, it\u2019s up 5%. So again, a very good performance, and it just shows when you focus on the things that you can control, what can be accomplished. In fact, if you look at the progression of cash gross profit per ton and you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis ended with the second quarter in 2019, and you compare that to the trailing 12 months ended the second quarter in 2021, so that\u2019s kind of 24-month period there, it\u2019s up 5%. So that\u2019s something that we will \u2013 we\u2019re always focused on. We always like to talk about that because that\u2019s clearly the driver of our profitability, and we\u2019ll continue to talk about that. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question, clearly, there\u2019s still some moving pieces around kind of the legislative agenda as it relates to the stand-alone infrastructure bill and potential reconciliation, but it does seem like things are kind of taking shape in a more tangible form. So I just wanted to ask for your thoughts on, as you\u2019ve read through the text and the amendments, how you\u2019re thinking about the potential support from the infrastructure bill? And how might we see these tailwinds manifest in terms of both timing and magnitude in your view? Tom Hill : Yes. I would tell you that we\u2019re excited about it. I mean this is a multi-generational opportunity for highway funding, and one that our country sorely needs. So this is exciting for us, not just for the company but also for the country. I think we\u2019re confident that Congress passes on an infrastructure package to include a long-term reauthorization of the FAST Act, it would be a roughly 60% increase from the FAST Act. At this point, all signs point to those significant increases in core highway funding. We think the Senate should pass their bill in the next week, which is incredibly exciting and then I think we\u2019re confident that Congress passes the bill this year. Now, it always \u2013 I would caveat that it always takes one to two years to see funding passed into shipments. Usually we normally say two years, but I think state DoTs have really matured into their increased their \u2013 their substantially increased funding and are much more \u2013 have much greater ability to step up work faster than what we saw over the last three years when the states dramatically increased state funding. Suzanne Wood : Yeah. I\u2019d just add to that, one more, of course the prospect of the passage of a bill, as Tom said, it\u2019s very exciting. I mean, from our perspective it also provides an opportunity. We think to kind of extend the cycle, giving us a longer period of time to continue to compound price, which then flows into compounding unit margins back to my earlier point. Mike Dahl : Right. Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. And my second question, I mean, made a comment about just the expected second half close and things going well with U.S. Concrete, when you say anything\u2019s going well, I just wanted to ask if you could elaborate a bit more, is that going well in terms of your conversations, management seal team to field team or integration wise, or is that a comment specific to your conversations with the DoJ and any update you can give on the review process? Tom Hill : I think short answer is all of the above. We\u2019ve had conversations, management team, the management team, we\u2019ve looked at what we have to do the integration, obviously that\u2019s limited until we close. They\u2019ve got to run their business independently of ours and vice versa. We\u2019re getting to know each other better, getting to know capabilities better, how do you overlay that and how do you move quickly, but accurately. And then the DoJ process, I think is going at this point quite well and we feel confident that we\u2019ll close it this year. Mike Dahl : Sounds good. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Great. Thanks for having me on. I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide some more color just on the timing headwinds you saw that impacted the concrete segment, do you think it\u2019s specific to 2Q, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any potential delays in other parts of your business, perhaps due to inflation or labor constraints that might be coming down the pike here in the second half of the year. Tom Hill : Yeah. Good morning, Garik. The short-term impact was timing of jobs. It had us, impacts of about $4 million in the second quarter. That was really some big jobs in Northern Virginia, they\u2019ll ship we think second half of this year and the volume should return. I think it\u2019s candidly a good time to be in the ready-mix business, while \u2013 again, while you have the short-term challenges of diesel, you\u2019re seeing ready-mix prices moving with great momentum in many markets around the country, we\u2019ll see two to three price increases this year alone as well ours. So while you\u2019ve got this quarter, maybe next from short-term headwinds from fuel, pricing is moving rapidly and I think that\u2019s a really good sign for the ready-mix business, along with those \u2013 the demand in the end users is improving as same as aggregates. Garik Shmois : Okay. And just to be clear. You\u2019re not really seeing any delays in other areas, just because of labor inflation or material inflation or supply chain constraints that might be backing up? Tom Hill : No, the jobs that we saw in the second quarter were just timing on the jobs. It wasn\u2019t inflation, supply or labor constraint. Garik Shmois : Great. Thanks for that. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning guys. Tom, I\u2019m just curious on the U.S., another one on the U.S. Concrete deal. Just curious how you are framing this to investors who are worried that you\u2019re increasing downstream exposure? Tom Hill : Well, I think that \u2013 if you look at our history, number one, we\u2019ve gone from 95% to 85% of our EBITDA coming from aggregates, when this closes 85% of our EBITDA will come from aggregates. I think more importantly you got to look at, how the two companies match up. The geographies work extremely well. California, Texas, Virginia, we match up very well. If you look at their technical capabilities, they\u2019re a very good operator in ready-mix concrete, we think they can help us. We think we can help them with our ability to expand unit margins \u2013 collectively to expand unit margins and aggregate. So we help each other. We think their culture fits ours very well. And you also got to remember, there\u2019s 12 million tonnes \u2013 12.5 million tonnes of aggregate in U.S. Concrete and so it is also which is very complimentary in places we aren\u2019t or product lines that we aren\u2019t. So it\u2019s very complimentary to us. And as I said, the management team fits very well. We know them well, they know us well. We started talking \u2013 we always talked to each other, because we know each other very well, but in our conversations and pre-closing, and to start to figure out how we put the companies together, it\u2019s going extremely well. So I think if you talk to anybody on the collective teams, we\u2019re all excited about this and see lots of opportunities. Adam Thalhimer : Thanks, Tom. Tom Hill : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Collin Verron : Hi, this is actually Collin on for Phil. Thank you for taking my question. Can you parse out how your different end markets performed to contribute to that 4% year-over-year increase in aggregate shipments? And then maybe dive a little bit more into trends in the non-res end market and how that business is tracking versus 2019 levels? Tom Hill : Sure. I think if you look across our footprint, it\u2019s pretty consistent. Non-res is improving. Non-res starts on a trailing six-month or trailing three-month basis have now turned positive. We continue to see strength, as you would imagine, the heavy non-res, the warehouse and distribution centers. But now we\u2019re seeing growth in things like government buildings, institutional buildings, healthcare, private schools and churches. And we\u2019re just starting to see green shoots on stores that follow new subdivisions. So I\u2019d call non-res out across our footprint pretty much as improving. Residential, it\u2019s going great. Single-family starts on a trailing 12-month basis were up 31% in our markets. Inventory is extremely low. This is almost all new subdivision work, which is more and more aggregate-intensive. So demand growth in this sector will continue to grow and still not overbuilt. Now you\u2019re seeing multifamily improvement. Permits for both multifamily and single family would support continued growth. So it\u2019s just strong on the res side. Highways, good. We\u2019re confident. We\u2019ve returned back to normal. I can talk about that more later. I think what\u2019s exciting, which is a little bit of a shift that we\u2019re seeing now, we\u2019re seeing growth in non-highway infrastructure. And this is \u2013 we started to see this in kind of the end of 2019, beginning of 2020, and then it got shutdown with a pandemic. But on a trailing 12-month or six-month and three-month, it\u2019s very good. And it\u2019s more in the sector of water sewage. And you got to remember that the housing growth is also driving the non-highway infrastructure. So all in all, you\u2019ve got non-res returning and has made the turn. The other three are now growing. Collin Verron : Great. Thank you for the color. Tom Hill : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Josh Wilson of Raymond James. Josh Wilson : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Josh Wilson : Just to make sure we tie out all the moving parts in the second half. Can you update the gross profit guidance. I think before you had said that the non-aggregates gross profit collectively would be up mid-to-high single. Where are you thinking that shakes out there? Suzanne Wood : Yes. I\u2019ll speak to that. In terms of our cash gross profit per ton, that\u2019s usually the measure that we call out we had for the full year, we had talked about that being sort of roughly mid-single digits. We don\u2019t see a reason to change that guidance at this point. Tom Hill : Yes. I think if you look at \u2013 and this is more of a longer-term view of this, as always, because cost can be so variable within a quarter. But year-to-date, we\u2019re 5%. I think we\u2019d tell you that as we march through the year, probably, if you \u2013 we\u2019ll absorb the inflationary pressures, and we\u2019ll end the year at mid-single-digit from a cash gross profit per ton. Josh Wilson : Got it. And with the heavy non-resi that\u2019s been the driver for so long, are any geographies seeing any moderation there at all? Or even if it\u2019s in like quoting activity? Tom Hill : No, it\u2019s still going well. And what\u2019s interesting about that is because it\u2019s big and flat, it\u2019s very aggregate-intensive, but their ability to go from bid to turn and dirt and shipping rock is probably faster than any segment we\u2019re seeing. I mean they\u2019re really quick at it. So I don\u2019t see any slowdown. The good news is, as we said, the light side is starting to see some growth in even stores, which is kind of the last one to fall in here, is starting to follow the subdivision with green shoots. Josh Wilson : Great. Good luck with the next quarter. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : Hey. Thank you, good morning. Tom, can you talk about the California public and private bid environment, just given you \u2013 that\u2019s one of your higher-priced markets, you\u2019re getting a good chunk of revenue from USCR there. Tom Hill : Yes. I would tell you, very good news. The residential market continues to improve a little bit better in Southern California, the Northern California, which was the hardest hit with the shutdown. Non-res, again \u2013 excuse me, the res is healthy. The non-res is improving, again, probably a little faster in Southern than Northern California, but both on the mend. Caltrans is a great story. Caltrans came out this week and upped their outlook for lettings in 2022 by over 50%. So great news from Caltrans. They have really matured into their funding fast. They\u2019ve got a lot of needs and they\u2019re going to put that money to work. So both for our aggregates business, our asphalt business, our concrete business and future aggregates and concrete business from U.S. Concrete, good signs, good omens and good news. Brent Thielman : Tom, that\u2019s their fiscal 2022, is that right? Tom Hill : Yes. So that starts July \u2013 correct, Caltrans, that\u2019s fiscal year 2022. So that starts, I believe, July 1 \u2013 started July 1. Brent Thielman : Very helpful. Thank you. Best of luck. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Hi, good morning Tom and Suzanne. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Michael Dudas : So just back to U.S. Concrete, your expectations on your return profile on the investment over the next several years, what were your expectations or how they frame related to other investment opportunities? And maybe you can tie that back to once the deal closes and the balance sheet gets restructured, your go-forward targets on whether certain type of debt levels, priorities on capital allocation? And will there be any more allocation one way or the other given how well you think the concrete can bring the cash into the business? Tom Hill : I wouldn\u2019t see a big shift in capital when you put the two together, either up or down, obviously. I don\u2019t \u2013 I think, again, I wouldn\u2019t see a shift in priorities in putting the two together. I think it gives us a lot of more flexibility on moving capital around and how we allocate it and mixing and matching. Again, I think we got to get it closed and we can give you a lot better view of returns and how that\u2019s going to look and give us \u2013 let us put the teams together and really at close. But I would tell you, at this point, I am more optimistic than I was when \u2013 before we started talking to them and feel very good about it. And that\u2019s how \u2013 what happens when we put the two together and how we help each other, but also the short term, the markets look to be improved. Michael Dudas : Do you think just from early indications that U.S. Concrete was fairly well capitalized in its current asset base? Tom Hill : I think they\u2019re fine. I think it\u2019s a well-run business. I think that team has done a good job. I think like all of us, they\u2019ve got places where they feel better than others. We would tell you the same thing about ours, but I don\u2019t think \u2013 again, I don\u2019t see any big shift with this. And I think that team has done a good job with allocating capital as well as running the business, servicing their customers and managing their operating efficiencies. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Tom for any additional or closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to talking to you next quarter or throughout the next few days and weeks and months. As always, the world is changing, and we hope that all of you stay healthy and safe and keep your families healthy. I look forward to talking to you. Bye-bye. Suzanne Wood : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instruction] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company's Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Emma and I will be your conference call coordinator today. During the Q&A portion of this call, we may -- we ask that you limit your participation to one question. This allows everyone who wishes the opportunity to participate. Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning. And thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. With me today, are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO, and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and the supplemental presentation posted to our website, vulcanmaterials.com. A recording of this call will be available for replay later today at our website. Please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the Company's earnings release, and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation, and other SEC filings. As the operator indicated, please limit your Q&A participation to 1 question. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark. And thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. This is our first Earnings Call since closing the U.S. Concrete acquisition in late August. Therefore, I like to begin by welcoming the former U.S. Concrete employees and customers to our Vulcan family. Also, I want to thank our team for its continued solid execution during a quarter that was challenging due to inflationary pressures and labor constraints. Despite these challenges, our team managed a controllable costs.  Moved pricing higher in all segments, and importantly, expanded our aggregates unit profitability for the 13th consecutive quarter. We generated $418 million of adjusted EBITDA this quarter, an increase of 4% as compared to last year. Profitability for the quarter, was held back by factors I mentioned earlier. Energy inflation was a significant $30 million headwind. Unit diesel prices were up over 50% leading to $14 million of additional expense. The cost of liquid Asphalt was over a $100 per ton higher than last year.  This sharp increase impacted our results by $16 million. And finally, labor constraints, especially for truck drivers, have caused delays and inefficiencies in our operations, as well as those of our customers. Even with these headwinds, we improved our aggregate cash gross profit per ton by 3% to $7.74. This was achieved through consistent execution of our 4 strategic disciplines, which helped to drive volume growth, higher pricing, and improve operating efficiencies. This strong performance and momentum it provides, sets us up well for '22, especially with respect to pricing.  Total aggregates volume, including U.S. Concrete, increased by 8% versus last year's quarter. On a same-store basis, volume was up 5%. This reflects continued improvement in demand across all end markets. The pricing environment in aggregates continues to be very positive across our footprint. Same store prices were up 3.1% of the quarter. And mix adjusted prices increased by 3.5%. We saw our early price increases gained traction and as a result, year-over-year average selling prices improved sequentially each quarter this year.  Although in place, straight pressures can create short to medium-term headwinds, the combination of inflation and improving visibility to demand has and will continue to create favorable environment for price increases. Operating efficiencies, and disciplined cost control help to offset some of the higher input costs we experienced. On a same-score basis, our aggregate's unit cost of sales in the quarter increased by only 1.7%, as compared to last year. Now, excluding the diesel effect, unit cost of sales actually decreased by 1%. While costs will be lumpy, we have delivered comparable results for the trailing 12-month period. This solid performance in Agora's helped to more than offset reduced profitability in non-aggregate segment. Our Asphalt business was negatively affected by both higher energy costs, and wet weather. Quarterly gross profit in the segment fell from $30 million to $7 million. Higher liquid Asphalt costs accounted for $60 million, this difference. We also experienced a rise in natural gas prices, which in turn impacted our plant production costs. Asphalt volume declined by 8% as volume growth in California, was more than offset by lower Arizona volumes due to extremely wet weather.  Average selling prices improved by almost 2% year-over-year and better than 2% sequentially. Evidence that pricing actions are beginning to ease some of the liquid asphalt inflation. I would expect continued price improvement as we pass along higher cost. In the country segment, gross profit increased by 18%, reflecting our ownership of U.S. concrete for 1 month. Same-store volumes declined by 7%, due to the completion of large projects in Virginia, and the availability of drivers to make up for any loss shipping days. For the quarter, same-store prices increased by 2%. Turning now to the demand picture, the story is relatively unchanged from the second quarter. Demand has improved across all of our major end markets, as well as geographies. The residential end use has shown continued strength with solid starts in single-family housing, multi-family starts have also performed well. With respect to the non-residential end market, improvement continues at a number of leading indicators we track. From its low point early, this year starts have consistently improve, returning to growth in recent months. The level highway stats are up, as states have moved back to more normal funding levels. With Vulcan markets outpacing other markets.  We look forward to the enactment of the bipartisan and infrastructure bill and the significant impact on volumes for years to come. Now looking forward, I want to briefly touch on our growth strategy and give a very preliminary view of 2022. As we shared on past calls, we have 3 paths to growth. These 3 are Organic growth, M&A, and Greenfields. Earnings growth in the underlying business is at the core of our growth strategy because it provides the most attractive, and compelling value proposition on a risk-adjusted basis. The benefits of this focus are clear as we expand our industry-leading unit profitability, despite the macro challenges we may face from time-to-time.  Next is M&A. We look for strategic opportunities that naturally complement our principal aggregates business. Given our leading market position, we have visibly -- we have visibility to all deals to come to the market. The key is for us to be disciplined as we consider, which deals to pursue. All opportunities are not created equal and we want to do the deals that create the most value over time. And as the final pillar to our growth strategy is development of greenfield slides.  There are times when an acquisition target is not available in a particular growth quarter. If that is the case, we turned to new Greenfield sites and we have a long successful history of developing them. During this quarter, we completed the U.S. Concrete acquisition and we're excited about the strategic fit, and how it naturally compliments our principal Aggregate business in California, Texas and Virginia. And gives us access to new platforms in New York and New Jersey. Already our teams are working together to identify strategic opportunities. As you would expect, we're taking a thoughtful approach to integration to ensure that we capture all available synergies. It's still early days on the integration. We intend to give you a more detailed briefing in February, but we're pleased with the wins we've seen so far. We are confident in our ability to generate at least $50 million of synergies on a 12-month run basis beginning mid-year next year. When most of the integration is complete but more to come. Suzanne will cover some additional highlights of the quarter and share our latest financial view on how we expect to finish 2021. But before I turn the call over to her, I want to reiterate our confidence in our prospects for 2022, particularly with respect to pricing and our ability to control what we can control.  The 2021 demand and inflationary environment sets us up well, as we head into 2022. A key to our pricing strategy, we're starting early in the spring with announced price increases. In certain markets we launched further increases. These increases are evident in our sequential quarterly pricing growth. Already we're discussing 2022 pricing expectations with customers. Clearly, we need to see where those conversations lead. But at this stage, I would be surprised if next year price increases are not at least 5%.  The demand picture also looks good leaning into 2022, although we are watching the labor situation closely. If labor constraints do continue, it's important to remember that the work is still there. It may just proceed at a slower pace. Effectively extending the recovery, and allowing us the opportunity to compound price, control costs and still grow earnings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments. Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Tom. And good morning to everyone. We've covered the key financial and operational highlights already, so I'd like to speak to the following topics. First, our balance sheet strength and capital allocation priorities. Second, our return on invested capital. And finally, our financial guidance for 2021. With respect to the Balance Sheet, we will continue to prioritize sensible leverage and financial flexibility in order to support our capital allocation strategy and maintain our investment-grade rating. The structure of our debt is sound, with long maturities that makes sense for our business. Due to our strong cash generation, we were able to reduce our net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio to 2.7 times following the U.S. Concrete acquisition.  This is just above our stated range of 2 to 2.5 times. And we will be focused on getting back within that range in the near term. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and the consistent application of those, while maintaining a sensible leverage range, has allowed us to improve our return on investment over the past 3 years. For Legacy Vulcan, the return was 14.7% up 240 basis points from 3 years ago. With the inclusion of 1 month of U.S. Concrete earnings, and a 1/4 impact of the acquisition on average invested capital, our return was 14.2% We'll continue to focus on the sequential improvement of returns.  The final topic I want to share this morning is our updated view on 2021 guidance. Our guidance incorporates U.S. Concrete 's expected EBITDA contribution since acquisition, as well as recent trends in demand, price, and costs. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the full year is now $1.43 billion to $1.46 billion. This includes $50 million to $60 million EBITDA from the acquisition. But excludes $115 million gain on a land sale completed in the first quarter. I'm sure there will be a number of questions on business trends and the outlook in the Q&A section. So, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thanks Suzanne. Before we're going to Q&A, I want to again, thank the entire Vulcan team, including our newest team members from U.S. Concrete, for their hard work and their dedication to serving our customers. Our people are what makes Vulcan better every day. We have and will always operate Vulcan for the long term. This means a strong emphasis on keeping our people safe and continuously improving our already strong culture.  Local execution is key to driving improvements in our business, particularly around our strategic disciplines. As we move forward, we will seek to maximize synergies with U.S. Concrete. As always, for Vulcan, we will maximize unit margin expansion, through our 4 strategic disciplines. And remember, improving financial returns is of paramount importance. And now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time. If you would like to ask a question [ Operators Instructions]. And as a reminder, we do ask that you limit your participation to 1 question to allow others opportunity to participate. We will take our first question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. Tom, I wonder if I could start off talking a little bit more about the pricing expectations for '22. Your very positive commentary about conversations, and then the comment about at least 5%? Thanks so much. Tom Hill : Yes, thanks. Daily is -- as I look forward, I think this is one of the most important themes. As we've said, over the past couple of quarters, the combination of visibility to growing demand, you couple that with inflationary pressures. This all bodes really good -- bodes well for aggregate prices. And our teams recognized us wholly-owned and started trying to move price in Q2. And as we predicted, our third quarter price increases were 3.1 mix just 3.5, which was up sequentially from 2.6 in Q2 and 1.3 in Q1.  And that sequential improvement is really important because it illustrates the improving pricing environment. So, looking forward, I would expect that trend to continue in Q4. And then looking past that at 2022, I think we'll see bigger jumps in pricing in January and in April as the 2022 fixed prices go into effect. So, as we said before, based on trends, backlogs, and customer conversations, I'd be very surprised if our 2022 price increases don't eclipse 5%. Stanley Elliott : That's pretty encouraging. Thanks, guys. Best of luck, Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Will go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Tom Hill : Good morning Trey. Trey Grooms : Good morning. And thank you everyone. And well done in the quarter, given the headwind, especially on the unit profitability. Well done. Tom Hill : Thanks. Trey Grooms : Tom and Suzanne, my question is looking into next year as well. You mentioned solid fundamentals, positive demand trends. But you also noted labor constraints which have obviously been a challenge for everyone. But taken all those things into consideration as you look at the geographies and the end markets that you serve, can you -- could you dive in a little bit more around how you're thinking about the volume outlook for '22 and maybe some of the key drivers there? Thanks. Tom Hill : Let's look present and then we'll look backwards into the quarter and then we'll look forward. So, on same-store basis, volume was up north of 5%, which was strong. The vast majority of our markets experienced volume growth, which speaks to the market 's underlying growing demand and how broad based it is. We'd have a little bit of weather in Alabama, parts of Texas, Arizona really got washed out. A little bit of weather in Northern California. Now, this -- but this was more than offset with really strong shipments in the Southeast and the Eastern seaboard.  As we look to 2022, 2022 may be the first year in well over a decade where we'll see growth in all 4 end users. So, it's just broad-based. Residential construction should continue to grow, non-res, it's just very important because it continues to -- we're continuing to cope through the pandemic and moves into growth into 2022. Non-power infrastructure, we think grows following the big residential growth we've seen this year and how we demand in 2022, we'll also see growth supported by improvements in state funding and some COVID relief funds.  So, all that's really good news for '22. Demand however, as we talked about the awesome headwinds, and you got supply chain issues, labor shortages in the beginning that have some impact on shipments. Now, those headwinds don't make demand go away, they only push it out and extend -- it really extends the cycle if that happens. So, the fundamentals for volume growth in 2022 are in place with some headwinds. And while it's kind of early in our planning stages under the conditions, I'd be surprised if we saw our growth above 4%. At the same time, that demand -- if we did have those headwinds, demand gets drawn out and extends the cycle, and with our ability to compound margins over time, that could be very helpful. So, fundamentals are really strong -- some dampening effect with supply chain and labor. But the underlying fundamentals are really good. Trey Grooms : Understood, thanks for the [Indiscernible] there and thanks for taking my question. Tom Hill : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Jeff Stevenson : Hi, this is Jeff Stevenson, on for Garik. Thanks for taking my questions. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Tom Hill : Sure. Jeff Stevenson : In the press release, you mentioned that Concrete same-store sales volumes were negatively impacted by a fewer larger projects. I'm just wondering if you could provide any more color on this and how does the U.S. Concrete look from a comp standpoint? Are they running the risk of fewer larger projects unless lumpy volumes? Any more color would be helpful. Tom Hill : Sure. The large projects we have finished up, we're in Northern Virginia, in the DC area, and it's just a little bit of a low in our in our backlog as we move into 2022. I think the underlying piece of Concrete improvement with the non-res piece. We see non-res growing in 2022. That's very important for ready-mix.  The other thing I was encouraged within the quarter on the same-store basis and also with U.S. Concrete, you're starting to see unit margin expansion. And earlier in the year, both our Concrete business and U.S. Concrete's Concrete business got dinged from diesel and combination of diesel and what I'd call traffic inefficiencies. Last year, we just didn't have any traffic on the road so we were able to deliver concrete very effectively and efficiently.  This year, not so much, and so it added some costs. While those were headwinds for '21 pricing at this point has jumped past that. It jumped past raw materials and we're seeing margin growth. So, as we move into '22 with the combined businesses, our predict, you will see volume growth really driven by non-residential construction growth, but also unit margin growth because prices have caught up in the past, cost changes from 2021. So, I'm very encouraged for our outlook in 2022 in this product line. Jeff Stevenson : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to [Indiscernible] Vish with Goldman Sachs. Analyst: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Tom Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Analyst: Tom, I am wondering if you'd be willing to expand on the M&A pipeline, how significant is it in terms of number of opportunities or magnitude of opportunities? And is there a time frame by which if we don't have meaningful M&A, we'd be looking to step up stock buyback. How are you Suzanne, and the Board thinking about that? Tom Hill : Sure. So, the pipeline, as you would expect, is a lot out there. It's not all created equal and will be, as we always are disciplined about our M&A opportunities, we'll be disciplined about the markets we want to be in, what synergies are unique to Vulcan. And then we got to be disciplined on the multiple or the amount you're willing to pay. And then once you get it integrated fast and accurately -- we got question earlier, do we have capacity? Yes, I would expect us to do some the size of U.S. Concrete, but more traditional bolt-on size deals, we'd be interested in are working on a number of them. Analyst: Perfect. Thanks. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Go next to Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. I'm just wondering how the margin profile of the U.S. Concrete aggregates assets compares versus the Company average, as well as maybe same question on Concrete. And then is there a possibility or timeline for normalizing that difference, if any, if you could just talk about margin profile. Tom Hill : So, their -- if you look at their aggregate unit margins, they're very respectable. They're probably a quarter less than ours. And so comparable, I think that they've done a good job with that. Their position in the markets are good, their structure of their markets is good, and it's very attractive. While they've done a really good job with that, I think that our -- and this is one of the important pieces of synergies, I think that our 4 strategic disciplines are very applicable to their business, to their aggregates business. We've already started on that. The teams have met and that's working.  So, I think that as we work into 2022, the same applies both from a pricing and a demand and a unit margin growth perspective look into 2022. And we think that we can help them take steps and just like they can in Concrete. Moving to ready-mixed, I think that they are operating disciplines and efficiencies are better than ours. They have some really impressive technology and where's my Concrete? The teams have already started applying that to our ready-mixed operations. And so, I think this is very helpful for both product lines that their technology and disciplines help us. Ourselves lives in aggregates and so that was one of the strengths of the deal. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Courtney Yakavonis : Hi, thanks for the question, guys. If we could just maybe follow up on the comments on U.S. Concrete. I think you have laid out a $50 million run rate synergies by mid-year and next year with more details to come in February. But can you just help us understand, are you thinking about that being primarily revenue driven from additional aggregate sales or is this more going to come from some of those operational cost focus measures that you talked about. But just when we're thinking about integrating that in, help us think about that. If that's more on the top line or the cost. Tom Hill : Yes. I think the short answer is all of the above. You put them all pretty good, but remember it's only been 70 days. That said, I'm very impressed at how fast our land leaders are putting the businesses together. The teams in California, Texas, and Virginia work together before the end of the first week when we closed and have already made more progress on market, sales, operating procurement strategies and tactics. Which will really pay off for us. Suzanne Wood : I mean, it's still early days, as Tom said, and some of these synergies take time to develop, and realize, but as we said in the prepared remarks, we are very confident in our ability to generate at least $50 million of synergies. And that is on the 12-month run rate basis beginning midyear next year when most of the integration efforts will be complete. I think it's important to note that this $50 million that we're referring to are identifiable cost synergies and efficiency synergies. And again, I mean, we believe that there are more synergies as Tom has talked about, and we're in the process of working on those. Tom Hill : Yeah. We will be back in February with more details, but the symbiosis between the 2 companies, from my perspective, is appearing better than we originally thought. I had -- I'll give you some concrete examples. I had the opportunity a couple of 3 weeks ago to sit down with the combined Texas team, and was really impressed and very pleased with their focused, creative, and insightful combination of business -- combined business plans, to leverage commercial opportunities so they can improve price and volume. And their detailed plans and improving the operational execution. And we've seen the -- we're seeing the same thing with the California and Virginia teams. So, in all markets, stronger market presence, pricing, and logistics capabilities. And you've got a bit of a much better opportunity to leverage procurement opportunities. And as I said earlier, we're -- we have the ability now to use our technology and theirs to improve both the ready-mix concrete and the aggregate product lines in the -- for the for the two companies. So, it's -- for me it's just exciting to watch. Courtney Yakavonis : Great. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Katherine Thompson with Thompson Research. Brian Biros : Hey, good morning. This is actually Brian Biros on for Katherine. Thank you for taking my question. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Tom Hill : Sure. Brian Biros : Morning. On aggregate it seems that you're starting good cost controls, at least on the costs you can manage yourself -- so kind of ignoring diesel there. Could you just clarify the puts and takes for cost controls in the quarter around that? Thank you. Tom Hill : Yeah. I think this is one of the things in the quarter that I'm most proud of. It was an excellent performance by our operators. First and foremost, they kept their people safe. Cash cost was up 2.6% in the quarter. Without diesel, it was down 1%. And so, the increase was all diesel, partially offset with some efficiency savings. And year-to-date -- so this is a trend, so year-to-date that cash costs was up only 1.2%, and without diesel again, down 1%.  This is a really strong performance, because while diesel is the most dramatic change, all our inputs were up. The steel is up almost 65%. And what that tells me is that our Vulcan way of operating strategic discipline is working. And our operators are making those efficiencies and those disciplines pay off. And so, while this is hard to do particularly in inflationary pressures, it's working. And as you've seen over the last 2 years with our performance, it's sticky I mean, it is there.  And that kind of cost performance allows us to capture price, to maximize unit margin growth, which is our -- you'd cash -- our cash unit margin now is at $7.74 a ton. And if you look back, this is a compounded annual growth rate of 7% in unit margin growth over 8 years including diesel. So, I would tell you, I'm very proud of our operators and they and on both know they're not done. Suzanne Wood : I just want to add one point of clarification on the unit cost of sales increase on the same-store basis. They were up 1.7% as compared to last year's third quarter. But excluding diesel, they decreased almost 1%, and those numbers are in the press release. Brian Biros : Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer, Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Tom Hill : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thanks. Adam Thalhimer : Comment a little bit on the outlook for downstream margins. Tom Hill : I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Adam Thalhimer : Can you comment a little bit on the outlook for downstream margins? Tom Hill : So, if you look at Asphalt first, we took a big hit this year with liquid. And it's kind of -- you're a little bit comparing the perfect storm because last year, liquid prices plummeted and the margins went up. This year, they spiked and it took a bite out of margins. As we said in the prepared remarks, 2022 should see strong demand from improved highway work, and Asphalt prices are moving to catch liquid and you saw that start to move in the quarter. But there is a lag.  So, we should see gross profit improvements in Asphalt in 2022, but I would not expect them to get back to 2020 levels. the reason why, is we had that big decrease in liquid in 2022. But I would expect profitability in the product line to improve based on volume improvements and unit margin improvements because prices are going up to catch liquid costs. Move into ready-mix, I think 2022 is set up very nicely for the combined Vulcan U.S.  Concrete ready-mix businesses. And again, that non-residential demand turning to growth in 2022 is very healthy for concrete demand. Northern California saw some headwinds in '21, it's really hangover from the pandemic. It was the most severe shelter in place. And the government offices shut down so nobody could get building permits. And that air pocket is what hit us in 2021, we're past that. The permits are out there.  Our backlogs are very good and growing, the same can be applied to New York exactly the same thing. And then Texas, it was good and we'll continue to grow. But the -- you couple all that with healthy pricing, price increases, which has now gotten into margin growth. I would really look forward to the 2022 Concrete business. Adam Thalhimer : Great. Thank you, Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : Will go next to Keith Hughes with Chouest. Keith Hughes : Thank you. Just a quick question on Asphalt, you've highlighted some of the issues and the quarter. I guess my question is on pricing. It seems like it would've been slated Morgan, given the whole market, isn't anything that you can talk about the path through an Asphalt and any endurance is there and any details would be very helpful. Tom Hill : Yeah, is this always a lag, you do have -- when you have spikes in an asphalt, you take a hit for a little bit of time until prices catch up. Again, like we saw in last year when it falls, the opposite happens and you're able to put those margins in your pocket for a well. So, liquid -- I think we'll settle down with that. We'll be able to catch it with price you sell that go up $2 in the quarter and will continue to accelerate. But it just takes time to catch up and I don't think we'll catch it all from '20 to 2022, but 2022 will be improved. Keith Hughes : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We go next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David Macgregor : Yes, good morning, everyone. Congrats on the good quarter. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. David Macgregor : Yeah. Good morning. I guess you've made repeated reference here to the same-store freight adjusted unit cost of sales excluding diesel, being down 1%. I'm guessing most of that would be volume leverage. So, just how should we think about the margin benefit of the improved legacy operating efficiencies and productivity you achieved through the pandemic period? And do you expect to cover next year's cost inflation with pricing, or are you expecting productivity to play a more significant role in the '22 margin progression story? Thank you. Tom Hill : If you look forward to 2022 obviously, prices north to 5%, that's really good and will definitely improve unit margins. We know our goal every year is through efficiencies and disciplines to offset any kind of headwinds we have in price. We've done a really good -- that operate has done a really good job with that this year, obviously, we couldn't overcome diesel, but price did. I don't think that you see the big spikes like we had with costs in diesel going forward, so for sure, price, you will see margin growth in 2022.  But it's going to be the combination of price and operating efficiencies because you just got to continue to improve those to offset it. I would tell you if I looked at things like tons per man hour or footprint through a plant or plant availability across our footprint, particularly our top 50 plants, which is the most of production. It's not just volume that's covered up costs, it's also those efficiencies are improving. And that's just good, smart hard work by our operators. David Macgregor : Thanks very much. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Timna Tanners of Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : Good morning Everyone. Tom Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Timna Tanners : Wanted to follow-up on the Q4 guidance in particular, if we could. If I take the midpoint of the new guidance versus the old guidance, it's effectively a $25 million increase as I understood it. But you also talked about, about a $50 million contribution I think from USCR. If I understood that wrong, please clarify. But wanted to just make sure I understood what's driving that change, what is happening in this fourth quarter with regard to maybe picking up some of that volume that you highlighted losing because of the weather? And if anything, you can share with us on the trend in October, that'd be great. Thanks. Suzanne Wood : With respect to your question on the guidance, you're spot on. There was a $25 million net change midpoint to -- previous midpoint to current midpoint. If you just take the middle of the U.S. Concrete guidance range, we gave that's 55, so that implies a $30 million reduction otherwise. And what you're seeing there is just the rollover of the energy costs -- the energy headwinds into the 4th quarter, that's our current expectation. Timna Tanners : Anything on October you can share? Suzanne Wood : I mean, we typically don't comment on October, on the call. I mean, it's pretty early days here in terms of closing, but I would say as we normal would at this point if we had anything materially different to say we'd say that in a press release or otherwise. So really no commentary. Timna Tanners : Okay. Thanks, guys. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next. So now go Jefferies. Unknown Analyst : Hey guys. Tom, the bottlenecks you alluded to limiting volume growth in 2022 to 4%. How much of that is tied to external dynamics versus how you're set up from a labor and production standpoint? And I guess bigger picture, do you see these issue is getting cleared out by 2023, and do you see a more pronounced acceleration of volumes? Tom Hill : I think that, oh wait till when we call for 2023. I think it's not us. I think we've got the capacity and the firepower to produce a lot more than 4%. I think it's really an ability for number 1. To get product to market through truck drivers and truckers. Second, is our customers\u2019 ability to get more employees and it's more to catch up as opposed to get work done. I think they get work done, but the ability if you have a week of rain and to catch that back up, now you don't have the crews to take out there for the next 2 weekends to do it because you're [Indiscernible] people too many hours, you don't have enough people in the crews.  And then the last thing is with particularly in [Indiscernible], you're seeing Supply-chain issues. Windows or door knobs or there's all kinds of different things that -- and there's a whole -- you can read about them, there's a whole list of them. But as you talk to the big residential customers, they're having supply-chain issues, and you have to put that mix in there and that hits non-res also. So, I think that while the underlying demand structure is very good, as I said earlier, what's really important is it's widespread geographically, but it's also across all 4 end uses.  And up until this year of -- a few up until 2022, we've always had one of those as a drag and I don't think we do in 2022. So, the fundamentals are there. I think you just have a little bit of a dampening effect with labor and supply chain. But if that clears up, we could do better at this point with work to be done and we'll come back in February with very clear guidance and the thought process behind that. But at this point, I would I would govern it to 4. Unknown Analyst : Okay, thank you. Tom Hill : For Lemming. I will be over 4 -- we're not trying to give guidance at 4 at this point, but I don't think you'll get over 4. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Wilson with Raymond James. Josh Wilson : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Josh Wilson : Just a few clarification on the modeling side, when you first announced the U.S. Concrete acquisition, you expected it to add a $190 million in EBITDA. Prior to synergies, is there been any revision to what the baseline is given recent trends? Suzanne Wood : Well, when we talked about that, we were basing that really on trailing 12 months through the end of March, and I would say that since that time, U.S. Concrete has experienced some of the same energy headwinds that we've experienced and others in the industry have experienced. So, it will -- we'll see where that leads. We've given -- we've given you guidance for the period of time since we've owned them through the end of the year, and we'll comment further on what we expect them to contribute in February. Tom Hill : I think they experienced headwinds we talked about with the recover from the pandemic and Northern California and New York. Obviously, they had the inefficiency cost headwinds with traffic getting back on the road. And the energy cost as Suzanne mentioned. As I said earlier, I think the market and demand headwinds are behind us. The permitting is strong, the backlogs are strong. Work is happening in the 2 coastal markets that we had concerns about in '21.  And really Importantly, at this point, price has moved past cost and showing growth in unit margin. And obviously like the rest of the construction material sector, they'll have price increases in -- all these markets will have price increases in ready-mix between January and April. I think '22 sets up really well for the Concrete business on the aggregates piece of it, much like ours. It's the same comments we said about 2022 with price and volume and cost would apply to the previous U.S. Concrete aggregates businesses. Josh Wilson : Thanks so much. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : Hey, great, thank you. Hey, Tom, I know it's been a short period of time since ownership USCR, but any change to your collective, go-to-market, or overall strategy in the market so you already overlap the business, I'm thinking particularly California and if it is too early, maybe you can just talk about what gets you excited about controlling the upstream capacity, and frankly, the downstream capacity you now have in that region because that all seems pretty attractive. Tom Hill : Yeah, it sits very well. It's a little too early to call the detail, and we'd like to do that in February, we'll do that in February. But I think what, as I said earlier, what really gets me excited is Those teams in California, Texas, and Virginia, we're together within days of the closing. They knew each other well, they were big customer virus, so they had relationships and they had their strategies and their tactics to improve volume, price, and leverage operating efficiencies and share information and assets and equipment.  Before -- they had it together before, we could go back and review and we're executing. So, it happened really fast, more to come. We'll put a lot of detail on that, but I'm very pleased with what those combined Lawn (ph) managers have already put in place and what -- how quickly and smoothly that's gone. I think they are coming out -- the culture is being so much like each other. And our previous relationship has helped us. And I think I underestimated the speed at which that would impact the line in businesses. So progressive [Indiscernible] great work. Brent Thielman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll, go next to Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Good morning, gentlemen, Suzanne. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Tom Hill : Good morning. Michael Dudas : When you're looking at your -- I know you have your capex budget for this year, but just as a preliminary thought for '22, and talking about your maintenance and your growth side, how's it looked just preliminarily? And looking at the USC assets that the capitalization of those assets, do they need to be caught up? Is there any special opportunities that you're seeing early on there? And I'm assuming you're probably going to budget a little bit more for inflationary contractor issues that probably haven't seen in the last several years. Thank you. Suzanne Wood : You're right. Clearly, the prices of everything is going up across the board. And when we also there as well have some supply chain issues to manage. But I'll just touch on this year first and then comment on next year. You'll note we kept our CapEx guidance for 2021 the same. And that's really as a result of reviewing U.S. Concrete 's needs for the period of ownership. We were able to fold that within the guidance range that we had. So really no big issues there. As we look forward to next year. Typically, we will spend somewhere between $450 million, $475 million give or take. I wouldn't expect that to be vastly different. We're obviously still in the early days, and in terms of putting together the 2 capital plans and the 2 budgets and having a really good look at that, but I haven't seen anything so far that makes me or us believe that we need to significantly pick up that capex guide. Michael Dudas : Excellent. Thank you. Suzanne. Operator : That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the call over to Tom for closing remarks. A - Tom Hill : Thank you for your interest in Vulcan. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Obviously, we're looking forward to 2022 in the meantime, please stay safe and healthy and keep your family safe and healthy. Thank you. A - Suzanne Wood : Thanks. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Vulcan Materials Company's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Catherine, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our website, vulcanmaterials.com.  A recording of this call will be available for replay later today at our website. Please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation and other SEC filings. [Operator Instructions]  With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. James Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy.  As you will have seen from the press release this morning, Suzanne has decided to retire in September to spend some well-deserved time with her family. I'll have more to say on this at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.  Now let's move to our fourth quarter performance and Suzanne will cover the full year performance later on. I want to thank our team for its strong execution during the fourth quarter. Our financial results were ahead of expectations despite ongoing challenges from inflationary pressures, particularly in energy and labor constraints. Focusing on our operating disciplines and proactive pricing actions, we once again saw expansion in our industry-leading unit profitability. At the same time, we made excellent progress on integrating U.S. Concrete into our business. This overall strong finish to the year allows us to carry considerable momentum into 2022. We generated $383 million of adjusted EBITDA this quarter, an increase of 23% over 2021. Energy-related inflation was the most significant impact to our business with $36 million worth of higher cost, of which $17 million related to diesel fuel, while the remainder related to liquid asphalt and natural gas. Labor pressures caused higher labor costs due to overtime.  In the face of these challenges, we were able -- still able to manage our controllable costs well. Aggregates cash unit cost of sales increased less than 1% as compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. This was an excellent operating performance, and I'd like to thank all of our operators and congratulate them on a job well done in 2021 and all the while delivering a world-class safety performance.  Our operating performance helped us improve Aggregates' cash gross profit per ton by 6% to $7.41. This result includes an $8 million acquisition-related impact for selling acquired material after its markup to fair value. Importantly, this progress on cash unit margin expansion represents the 14th consecutive quarter of improvement.  We achieved this by consistently executing on our 4 strategic disciplines which helped to drive volume growth, higher pricing and improved operating efficiencies. These strategic disciplines will help us take advantage of the favorable demand and pricing environment in 2022.  Total Aggregates volume, including U.S. Concrete, increased by 13% versus last year's quarter. On a same-store basis, volume was up 7%. This reflects not only continued improvement in demand across all the markets, but also favorable weather in November and December. The Aggregates pricing environment continues to strengthen across our footprint. Same-store prices were up 3.7% in the quarter as compared to the prior year and mix-adjusted prices increased by 4.2%. Year-over-year, mix-adjusted pricing sequentially improved throughout the year, having started at 1.3% in the first quarter. The pricing actions taken to date, along with better demand visibility, set the stage for a favorable pricing environment in 2022.  Asphalt gross profit was $4 million in the quarter compared to $17 million last year, as a 35% increase in liquid asphalt costs created a $17 million headwind for us. As we discussed before, liquid asphalt costs were at 3-year lows in 2020 and the significant fluctuation of these costs have made for a more difficult comp year-over-year. The good news is that our selling price for asphalt mix increased 5% from the prior year quarter. Through 2022, as pricing catches up, we will work to get back to Asphalt segment's long-term averages in terms of margins.  Concrete's gross profit grew from $9 million to $22 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was due to the acquisition, combined with higher shipments and price growth in our legacy business. Results were negatively impacted by higher diesel prices and the availability of drivers.  Before we move on to the overall demand environment, I'll comment briefly on U.S. Concrete. We continue to be excited about this acquisition and how it expands our footprint. It naturally complements our existing Aggregates business in California, Texas and Virginia, and gives us access to new platforms in the Northeast. We moved immediately following the acquisition to begin securing cost savings and synergy opportunities. As I mentioned previously, the integration is going well, and our progress accelerated during the fourth quarter with both -- from both operational and back-office standpoint.  I am pleased with how the business and management teams have blended seamlessly during the first 4 months of ownership. We remain confident in our ability to generate at least $50 million of initial synergies -- initial cost synergies on a 12-month run basis beginning midyear.  Now I'll touch briefly on the demand picture, which is increasingly positive. The key takeaway is that for the first time in many years, all 4 end uses are expected to grow. The residential end-use has continued to show growth in starts in both single-family and multifamily housing, and we expect starts to continue at these high levels. Nonresidential starts continue to strengthen over a broader range of categories, improving nonresidential demand will be positive and help drive growth in our Aggregates and our Concrete businesses.  On the public side, growth is expected in both highways and other infrastructure. The recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will add to existing demand as well as elongating cycle. Having said that, we do not expect it to have a significant impact in 2022. We are well positioned in the attractive growth markets we serve, and those markets are poised to benefit greatly from the legislation in coming years.  Before I turn the call over to Suzanne, I want to reiterate our confidence in our prospects for 2022, particularly with respect to demand visibility, pricing and our ability to control what we can control. We will be mindful of potential pressures from both inflationary trends and tight labor markets. We will continue to focus on our operating excellence and our strategic sourcing disciplines to help offset some of these pressures. Now I'll turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments. Suzanne? Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. While we faced some challenges in 2021, it was a year of significant accomplishments, including the completion of our acquisition. Our most notable financial achievements were the growth in our unit profitability and adjusted EBITDA. Full year Aggregates cash gross profit per ton rose by 5%, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 10%. The ability to generate numbers like this while incurring $93 million of higher energy-related costs across the segments demonstrates the strength, flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-focused business model.  It also points to the contributions of our 4 strategic disciplines which help us make the most of any economic environment. Aggregates prices increased by 3% as compared to the prior year, and we held our cash unit cost growth to less than 2% through efficiency improvements and general cost controls. This allowed us to offset inflationary pressures and improve our unit profitability.  With respect to the balance sheet, we quickly reduced our net leverage to the top end of our target range, ending the year at 2.5x. Given our ability to generate strong cash flows, there is capacity and liquidity to invest in other opportunities, whether organic or inorganic. But as always, we will be disciplined in doing so.  Certainly, we'll continue to prioritize sensible leverage and financial flexibility in order to support our capital allocation priorities and maintain our investment-grade ratings. Our debt structure is sound with long maturities that make sense for our business. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and have led to an improving return on investment profile. On a trailing 12-month basis, our ROIC was 14.2%. While investing in growth and overcoming inflation and the pandemic, we have improved our ROIC by 160 basis points over the past 3 years.  Now turning to our outlook. Let me make a few comments before turning the call back over to Tom. Following a strong performance in 2021, we expect 2022 to be another good year of earnings growth. In terms of our guidance, it incorporates the full year contribution of U.S. Concrete. Given the level of integration and change going on in our business, we are providing guidance on a consolidated basis.  We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $1.72 billion and $1.82 billion. The midpoint of this range represents a 22% increase over 2021. We've outlined the more detailed guidance in the press release, but let me touch on a couple of key items. First, we project a high single-digit growth in our Aggregates cash gross profit per ton, driven by an expected 6% to 8% increase in Aggregates pricing and 5% to 7% increase in shipping volume. As mentioned on the third quarter call, volumes may be affected by labor constraints, and therefore, we've tried to be thoughtful about the volume guidance range.  If labor constraints continue in 2022, it's important to remember that the work is still there. It may just proceed at a slower pace effectively extending the recovery and allowing us the opportunity to compound our unit margins. With respect to costs, they are expected to rise by mid-single digits, but we will do all we can to control what we can control.  In non-aggregates, we anticipate cash gross profit of $300 million to $325 million with approximately 75% of that coming from Concrete. Most of the improvement will be driven by a full year of earnings from the acquisition of U.S. Concrete but also from improvement in our Asphalt and legacy Concrete businesses. SAG expenses will range from $485 million to $495 million, reflecting the inclusion of U.S. Concrete and anticipated synergies as described on our last call. And finally, we expect to invest between $600 million and $650 million in capital expenditures, including growth and capacity-adding projects. This compares to $465 million invested in 2021 and includes a full year of expenditures for U.S. Concrete.  I'll turn the call back over to Tom now for closing remarks. James Hill : Thank you, Suzanne. Before we go to Q&A, I want to comment on a supply chain issue. For 30 years, Vulcan Materials has quarried limestone near Playa del Carmen, Mexico on land that we own. We are extremely proud of our history as a good corporate citizen, and I am particularly proud of the 450 operators of that facility. They operate safely and have contributed thousands of hours in service to the surrounding communities and the environment. Since late 2018, we have been engaged in a NAFTA arbitration with Mexico in order to secure our rights to quarry future reserves. A hearing took place in 2021 and we expect a ruling in the second half of 2022. We have continued to engage with government officials to pursue an amiable resolution of that dispute.  However, recently, Mexico has taken additional actions that adversely affected our operations in Mexico. We are focused on taking care of our customers affected by these actions and we will continue to work with the Mexican authorities to reach a mutually agreeable and beneficial solution. Now looking at Vulcan in total. I want to again thank the entire Vulcan team for their hard work and dedication to servicing our customers. Our people are what makes Vulcan better every day. We have and will always operate Vulcan for the long term. This includes keeping our people safe and improving on our already world-class safety record. The 3 key elements of our near-term strategy that will deliver value for our shareholders are the following : one, execute at a local level; two, drive unit margin expansion by focusing on our 4 strategic disciplines; and three, maximize synergies with U.S. Concrete. I'm looking forward to working with our teams this year to accomplish our goals.  Before I close, let me comment on the leadership changes I mentioned at the beginning of my comments. Effective March 1, Darren Hicks will serve as our Chief Human Resources Officer. Our culture and our people are key to our success, and Darren brings a wealth of experience to the new role. We are confident he is the right person to continue to help drive Vulcan forward into the future.  And of course, as I said, Suzanne is planning to retire later this year. Mary Andrews Carlisle will be replacing Suzanne effective September 1. She is the ideal person to step into Suzanne's shoes, having worked closely with both Suzanne and me in the planning and execution of our strategy for a number of years now. Although we hate to see Suzanne go, we fully support her decision, and we are grateful for her commitment to ensure a smooth transition.  And now Suzanne and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Noah Merkousko with Stephens. Noah Merkousko : Congrats on a nice finish to the year. James Hill : Thank you. Noah Merkousko : So Tom and Suzanne, thanks for all that detail on the guide. Could you talk about how you're thinking about the puts and takes around the cadence of how this year is expected to unfold in '22? James Hill : Sure. I think as we look at '22, it's important, we look back because it sets the tone. As it goes to '21, I'm really proud of our people's performance really over the last 2 years. Despite -- you think about despite a pandemic, labor shortages, inflation, we were able to grow unit margins mid-single digit over the last 2 years, and that just tells me our strategic disciplines are working. Our teams turned in EBITDA growth of 10% the last year despite a $93 million in ex synergy costs. This is just a job well done. And if you look forward to '22, it's shaping up to be a really exciting year. You've got all 4 end uses should experience growth. So the fundamentals for demand growth are really good, albeit there'll be some headwinds from labor, supply chain issues. So if those -- if the supply chain issues and labor ease up, you probably got some upside on volume but we try to be thoughtful there. So we've got to see that happen for us. Pricing momentum built through the year in '21, and we've carried that momentum into '22. I think we'll see continued disciplined cost control like we saw last year even in the face of inflation. And that discipline allows us to grow aggregate unit margins by high single digit in '22.  And so we'll see -- on top of that, I think we'll see both volume and unit margin growth in Concrete and Asphalt as we march through '22. Now remember, the fourth quarter is going to have some challenges. You still got the same energy comps you saw in Q3 and Q4 of last year. We probably have a challenge of energy of some $35 million. Weather was challenging in January, February. You had some COVID spikes that affected crews and labor in January. But I think we quickly get past that and have a really strong and exciting '22. Operator : The next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Suzanne, best of luck. I know we so have plenty of time to hear you on these calls. But can you talk a little bit more about the confidence that you're seeing on the residential market? I mean some of the mortgage rates, some of those sorts of numbers seem to be maybe not quite as positive as we've seen. But on the put side, certainly, I think there's an argument, there's a lot of markets that are structurally underbuilt in part of your footprint. But curious, what sort of conversations you're hearing and having with some of these builders on longer-term land issues and things like that, that would give us a little more confidence even beyond '22? James Hill : Yes. First of all -- and I would tell you, I think res, we see strong growth in '22. I think it's very widespread across almost all of our markets, maybe some weakness in Chicago, Baltimore. You've got new subdivision construction continuing, so it's very aggregate-intensive, which is great for us. Now I would tell you it's going to be a bit slower -- grow a bit slower rate than what we saw in '21, which was, as we all know, was white hot. And as you called out, that's due to supply constraints, inflation and interest rates and land. So all in all, a good slate. Now if it's -- just stepping back and look at interest rates, Freddie Mac rate for 30 years at 3.7%. That's still extremely low rates. So while not as fast as '21, it will see growth. Operator : The next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Kathryn Thompson : And Suzanne, best of luck with your new chapter. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Kathryn Thompson : Wanted to -- for guidance for '22, I just want to look backwards in order to look forward, just for some clarifications, especially with USCR in the mix. First, on the Concrete side, some puts and takes on the Concrete business and how New York and California ops were impacted by Omicron shutdowns? And what does that mean going to '22? And then on the Aggregates side, once again with guidance, bridging the delta between same-store sales volumes versus those contributed by USCR in Q4 and frame how that delta should be accounted for in '22 guidance. James Hill : Yes. Thank you. Let's start with Aggregates. And as we look back, we finished last year really strong. Q3 was up 8%, 5% on same-store. Q4 was up 13%, 7% on the same-store. But you got to really look at those quarters to understand that. Remember, Q3 comp was comping over 2020, where we had the most severe shelter in place. So it was a pretty easy comp. And then in Q4, we saw unseasonably good weather in November and December.  Now when you turn to '22, as we said, the good news is the fundamentals are there. We're seeing growth in all 4 end uses. But you've got -- that's dampened by challenges from supply chain and labor for our customers and particularly for our carriers. Transportation may be a challenge -- is probably going to be a challenge in '22. So the guide in the volume is growth of 5 to 7. Same-store is really hard to call out because those businesses are now so integrated, so there's a lot of mixing and matching. But if I had to call that out, I'd call it 2 to 4 range. We try to be thoughtful about that guidance because of all of the challenges we're seeing from labor and supply constraints. But if the supply chain and labor ease up, we've probably got upside to volume in Aggregates. On Concrete, if you remember, volumes were challenged in Concrete in 2021 due to -- in California and New York because they were the most severe shelter in place. And the government offices just shut down, so we got to the point where we couldn't get -- our customers couldn't get building permits.  I think that as you look forward -- and then we had challenges with diesel and efficiencies because traffic came back in. But I really like how '22 is shaping up for Concrete. Volumes should be much improved. We passed the air pocket of shelter in place in Northern California, New York. Remember, you got nonresidential demand segment has turned to growth in 2022. That's a big impact on Concrete. DFW continues to be very good. So we'll see volume growth in 2022, but we'll also start to see margin expansion as prices have moved past headwinds. You couple all of this with our California, Texas and Virginia, the Vulcan and USC businesses are function as one. I think Concrete will be a much improved business in '22. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Suzanne, congratulations. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if we could just expand on the situation in Mexico. Sorry to hear you have to go through that after all the years of safe operations there. Can you talk about what the contingency plans are for serving customers? Is it via rail from the Georgia area? And obviously, that comes at a higher cost. So I'm wondering are we able to push through the higher cost in real time as we face this disruption? James Hill : Yes. First of all, we're not having to do that. I think let's step back and look at Mexico. It's important to note that we have all the legal rights to operate in Mexico. We have all the appropriate permits in place. We're in negotiations to come to a resolution that benefits all the parties of interest. Mexico is interested in our properties for tourism, which we believe will coexist with our existing operations. In fact, we think that continue to operate there will ultimately benefit the overall volume for tourism and we believe this will happen.  So if you kind of put it in perspective, we shipped a little over 7 million tons from -- to the U.S. from Mexico in 2021. Those tons are in our guidance, and we continue shipping from our yards and we're now back shipping from Mexico to the U.S. So look, this thing will work out. We'll be fine if you could supplement some by rail. But at this point, we're shipping and we're servicing our customers. I think if you really step back in this and the big picture for all of this stuff and the opportunity in '22 is a big opportunity we're talking about in volume and price. And so overall, it's shaping up to be a very good year. And we'll get our situation in Mexico. Operator : We'll go now to Anthony Pettinari with Citibank. Anthony Pettinari : Congratulations to Suzanne on the next chapter. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Anthony Pettinari : Tom, I was just wondering, in terms of infrastructure spending, if you could remind us the kind of the timing that you expect for that demand to flow through in '22 or maybe more in '23. And then in terms of the appropriations bill, which seems like it's been stalled, is the delay there -- does it have the potential to meaningfully impact the timing of that infrastructure spending and when you would see that through Aggregates sales? Just any thoughts on that. James Hill : Yes. I think first of all, to highway demand in '22, we'll see growth there. I think it will flow through and probably ramp up as the year goes along. States are flushed with capital as tax receipts are up across the board and remember, those states still have COVID relief funds. And now that money is accelerating in lettings and bid works. So '22 demand should grow throughout the year sequentially. We don't think we'll see any of the IIJA funds in '22. Maybe a little bit at the end of the year, but it's really a '23, '24 play. So let's step back and look at how IIJA flows. Money flows 2 ways through this. First, funds that -- which flow through regular federal programs prior to IIJA, like things like the FAST Act are fully available to states past appropriations -- once we get appropriations. Second, funds or new discretionary programs will flow later because you have to write in the active programs. This is why we say that, that funding will take the new funding, the additional funding would take time to flow through, which is why we predict we'll start to hit in '23, '24. But I think still important to remember, 76% of IIJA funds will be distributed states via formula. So 2/3 of those formula funds will go into Vulcan states. This is a big deal and a big advantage to Vulcan-served states. Operator : The next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : On the pricing guidance, obviously, it seems like the increases here at the beginning of the year and throughout the first quarter are being well accepted. But if you could provide any color on how those discussions are going? And does the guidance that all rely on additional pricing beyond what you've already announced? And of course, let me throw my congratulations to Suzanne there as well. Suzanne Wood : Thank you, Garik. James Hill : Yes. Well, pricing, I think, is a really good story from the beginning of last year. We booked a lot of momentum, as we talked about in '21, and we've carried that into '22. Look, we said all the time, inflation and visibility to growing demand are excellent catalysts for price increases. And you saw us -- our guide to 6% to 8% price range, we have a lot of confidence in that. It's very widespread. It's through all markets.  Now included in that, we don't have second half price increases. They're not in our guidance. They are possible. There are some upside. It's way too early to call that. We'll start having discussions here in the next few months about that. And I think we'll have a lot better feel for that as we get into the second quarter.  But at this point, 6% to 8% is great. As the world goes along, the demand continues to improve. There will be opportunities for pricing. But I think we're confident in the midpoint of 7% or the range of 6% to 8% going into this, and that leads us to high single-digit margin growth with our operating abilities, and we think that's a strong showing for '22. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : I reckon that '22, you're still contending with these inflationary costs. I think you said you're embedding mid-single digits. I'm just curious if that is peaking in where diesel and liquid asphalt are today? Or any relief there? And then when we think of 2023, is there any chance that we see some relief that incrementals on the aggregate side could be in that 60% target range? James Hill : Let's take it [indiscernible] first. I mean we were very close to just below 60% in '21. I think we'll be around -- we will guide you to 60% in '22, which is kind of where we always guide you. I think that doing that in a period where you've got is a bigger jumps in diesel cost is a heck of an operating performance. And I'm proud of that performance in '21. Confident we'll be able to do it in '22 from -- to get to the target of 60% of incrementals. As you look at the operating side of the business and cost, I would tell you, I could not be more proud of our Vulcan operators and their performance in '20 and '21 and going into '22. As always, they will make sure that our people were healthy and safe.  Then let's look at it, they just crush rock like champs. And just step back and think, our total cost of sales was only up 1.5% last year with diesel up over $40 million. And that's with all the goods and services were dramatically up. Labor was up. And that's our operations strategic discipline at work. And I'm proud of those guys, those men and women. We're carrying that momentum into '22. We're calling out maybe a little higher cost increases with mid-single digit, really driven by, as you called out fuel. But you also got labor, you've got inflation, just everything we use. But that still leads us to high single-digit unit margins. And in a period of inflation like we got, that is a very good performance.  And that's what Vulcan is built for. That's what we talk about all the time. This is who we are. We've built to dampen headwinds, like you see and take advantage of tailwinds, with the extra volume and price. And we did it in '20, we did it in '21. I have all the confidence in the world we'll -- our men and women will be able to do it in '22. Operator : We'll go now to Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Christopher Kalata : This is actually Chris Kalata on for Mike. I was hoping to ask about kind of your thoughts on the supply chain outlook this year, obviously, it has implications on volumes and pricing. So I was wondering, you mentioned potential upside if things start to improve. Any sense you could -- any way you could help quantify the potential upside there? And to the extent supply conditions don't improve, what upside is there on the pricing as an offset, just your thoughts on how that evolves through the year? James Hill : Yes. It is -- for us, if I'll take our operations than our customers, I think our procurement folks, and I'll call them out, they did a great job. We've had very few internally. Now getting rock to customers, it was a challenge in '21. It will be a challenge in '22. And that is from both rail and truck that is labor, and it is challenging. The railroads all have in trouble. I think they say they're going to improve, I believe them. I think it will get better, but it's still a challenge.  And then you just look at projects out there and you talk to our customers, and it's everything from switch gear to some types of pipe to door knobs to windows to plumbing parts. So it's just so widespread, and it's -- I think it's too early to call anything better than what we've seen in our guidance. I think in our guidance, we were thoughtful. Again, if things start to ease up, I think you've got opportunity there. As we look at price, I would call our cadence of price last year was a pretty sharp curve. I think that curve will be -- won't be as sharp as it is this year. I think you'll see more consistent pricing throughout the year in that 6 to 8 range kind of starting in the first quarter and working all the way through.  Again, if we have opportunities for second half prices and it's too early to call, maybe that gets -- that curve gets a little steeper. That slope gets a little steeper. We'll keep plugging at that, and we'll keep you posted. Operator : The next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng : Suzanne, thanks for all the help through the years and Mary, congrats. I'm looking forward to working with you. Suzanne Wood : Thanks. Philip Ng : Tom, I guess, you kind of alluded to midyear price increases a few times on this call. I believe your -- one of your bigger competitors have actually some commentary on their pricing letters for the first time that, hey, signaling to their customers that you should probably expect one this year. So how have you guys kind of approached that? Have you started signaling to your investor -- I mean, your customers on potentially a midyear price increase for aggregates? And any color on the pricing momentum you're seeing in California? How does that kind of stack up to, I think, the 5% to 8% you guided? James Hill : I think that, at this point, I think we guided to the 6% to 8%. I think we're -- this is February. This is the middle of February. We're just starting to have conversations with fixed plant about midyear. It's really early in the process. Same thing with bid work, way too early to call. I think I'm confident in the 6% to 8%, but we'll see what happens. I would tell you that pricing in California is consistent with the rest of our model. There's opportunity there. And our customers know the inflationary pressures we have, and they have them also.  So it's -- and they're also looking at moving their pricing. So the whole sector is going up. Again, that visibility to growing demand gives people the confidence taking this on price and then you've got the inflationary pressures, it's just a little easier conversation. But I think it's -- while we're beginning to have conversations about second half pricing, and there may be opportunity there to -- it's way too early to call. Operator : We'll go now to Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Congrats on the strong Q4. Hey, on the asphalt side, Tom, real quickly, can you comment on the outlook for volumes in California and Arizona this year? James Hill : Yes, good. Both of them improved. Arizona got hit last year, and it was a problem for us with volume in '21, and it was really timing on projects, and it was supply chain. We got held -- our customers got held up with, I think, some big piping and other parts for utilities that just held up projects. But I would tell you, both have opportunity for improved volume. And I think that like the rest of the product line, as we march through the year sequentially and prices go up after we get in the second half, we'll see margin growth. Now the first half is going to be challenged because you probably got a big negative comp and liquid AC of about $15 million in Q1, but we'll get past that. And as we saw prices go up in Q4, 5%, they're moving up. And as we always do, we got -- that's a delay there. It's transient, and we'll catch it. Operator : We'll go now to Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Mark, Tom, congrats, Suzanne and a shout out to Mary and Darren as well. Suzanne Wood : Yes. Thank you. James Hill : Thank you. Michael Dudas : Tom, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're seeing some growth in nonres. Maybe share some views on is light starting to catch up to the visibility on heavy? And is that something that can continue to gain strength throughout the year, given the supply chain issues? Is there any difference in supply chain issues on nonres, also maybe [indiscernible] James Hill : A little bit. But it's -- for nonres last couple of years has been pretty volatile. We spent 2020 falling. We spent '21 recovering, and we'll see growth in '22. Heavy nonres, still strong in '22. I think we're seeing growth in traditional nonres, which as we predicted as following subdivision growth and that's coming on. That will come on in '22. And we're starting to see green shoots and high-rise projects.  And importantly, remember, nonres is very important and very good for our Concrete business. So our timing is good with that with the purchase of U.S. Concrete. It's a sector we're excited about. They too have supply chain issues. Yes, they're different from res, I think they're probably a little less challenged, but it's a volatile situation and we'll have to watch it as we go through the year. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : And Suzanne, good luck on what comes next. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. David MacGregor : I guess I wanted to -- Tom, you had talked about the fact that you don't expect the IIJA business really comes through meaningfully at least until 2023. In the meantime, in 2022, you've got all 4 of your main verticals firing here, and it's creating a 6% to 8% price environment. What happens if those 4 verticals remain strong into 2023 and then you layer in on top of that the incremental business associated with the IIJA, what gives? I mean how do you find market equilibrium here? Do prices just go parabolic or do you bring on incremental channel capacity? I realize you probably have rock-crushing capacity, but it would be more of the channel capacity, I guess. But how do I think about how that resolves into 2023? James Hill : I think what you see is continuing compounding unit margins. I think that what we said was that the IIJA gives us a lot more security of extending the cycle. So if you were to have an air pocket in the private side, you covered up with IIJA. But I think we stick to our disciplines, and that's why those 4 strategic discipline is so important that you continue to service your customer to earn that price through the commercial efforts. We take that price in those -- and that -- to the bottom line by continuing our operations disciplines and our cost control and operating efficiencies, use the procurement to make sure we get the goods and services we need to keep those operations running in times of supply chain and labor challenges.  And then those logistics, it's tough to get -- logistics is so important these days because there's just a shortage of labor in both rail and truck and us being efficient to that is really important to maximize profitability. But you're right, it bodes well. If we believe the private side will continue, it bodes really well if that happens. But even if there's a little slippage or some happens that would challenge that, I think the magnitude of this extends the cycle and continuous growing our margins. Operator : Next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Courtney Yakavonis : Congrats, Suzanne. Suzanne Wood : Thank you, Courtney. Courtney Yakavonis : I just wanted to follow up on some of the discussion about the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. So I think you had mentioned you think it might take a little bit longer to hit in '23 and '24. At this point, are you thinking it's a relatively even impact between the 2 years? Do you see it more weighted to '23 and then just incremental follow-through in '24? Or is it the other way around?  And then how are you thinking about it from a volume perspective versus a pricing perspective? Do you have more confidence that we'll see a significant increase in volumes? Or do you anticipate more of it coming through on the pricing side? And I think someone had asked here about hyperbolic pricing, but are we setting up for a situation where we could have 2 to 3 years of sustained double-digit pricing growth? James Hill : Yes. So from a volume perspective and the cadence of the new funding, what we're saying is because -- and this is where I talked about the second new discretionary programs, they take time to flow through because you have to write regulations and act programs. And that just takes time. That's the reason we say, look, we'll have growth in '22 from states increase in funding, the new federal fund increase in funding will start to flow through in '23 as they enact those programs. And they start to -- then they get the lettings and then they put the job to work -- the jobs to work and we ship rock. And I would expect a ramp-up through -- maybe a little bit this year, probably doubtful, but you'll start to see a ramp-up in demand as we march through '23, '24 to '25 as those programs mature and those funds flow to work. Now with that, you've got -- embedded in that is you've got very -- you'll have very clear visibility to be a state DOTs to work that's coming. And that's growing demand. And that visibility to growing demand gives everyone confidence to take risk on jobs and take risk on price. So it will be good for both volume and price -- but I would expect for volume a gradual ramp-up, '23, '24, '25 and pricing to follow. Operator : This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill for any closing remarks. James Hill : Thank you, guys, for your time today. We -- as always, we appreciate your interest in Vulcan. We hope that you keep you and your families safe and happy. Suzanne and Mary Andrews and Mark and I will be out to see you in the coming days and weeks. You guys have a great rest of the day. Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thanks a bunch. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company's First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now, I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our Web site, vulcanmaterials.com. A recording of this call will be available for replay later today at our Web site. Please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation and other SEC filings. As the operator indicated, please limit your Q&A participation to one question. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom. James Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials, and I hope that you and your families had a safe and healthy start to the year. Our teams executed well in the first quarter. They remained focused on capitalizing on pricing opportunities, and mitigating cost pressures. Their efforts have and will continue to result in the expansion of our unit margins. Our strategic disciplines are helping us to both take advantage of tailwinds and dampen headwinds in a very dynamic environment. We delivered solid results in the first quarter. We generated $294 million of adjusted EBITDA, a 20% increase over the prior year, despite accelerating inflation, continuing volatility in energy markets, and ongoing disruptions in supply chains. This quarter again demonstrates the resiliency of our Aggregates business and our team's strong execution of our strategic disciplines. Over the trailing 12 months, we have delivered 10% adjusted EBITDA growth in spite of $131 million of higher energy-related cost. On a trailing 12 months, Aggregates' cash gross profit per ton has improved for 15 consecutive quarters absent the impact of selling-acquired inventory. In all business segments, the pricing environment is strong due to growing demand and ongoing inflation. Momentum continued with year-over-year growth in Aggregates' mix adjusted price increases sequentially for the fifth straight quarter. Our combined commercial and operational execution contributed to higher cash gross profit in both Aggregates and total non-Aggregate segments. In the downstream businesses, volume, price, and material margins improved in both product lines. Turning now to the segments, Aggregates' gross profit improved 9% to $243 million, or $4.58 per ton. Demand is healthy across our footprint, and volume improved 14% or 7% on same-store basis. Shipments were in line with expectations since the prior year's quarter was negatively impacted by the big February freeze. As anticipated, Aggregates' pricing showed strong momentum in the first quarter with freight adjusted pricing increasing 6% over the prior year's first quarter. Mix adjusted pricing improved 7%. We expect to see continuous strength in pricing throughout year, and are confident about midyear price increases that will be particularly impactful to 2023. As expected, our costs were elevated in the quarter on a year-over-year basis since the inflationary impacts did not begin in earnest until the second quarter last year. Over the trailing 12 months of continuously rising diesel and other inflationary impacts, our freight adjusted unit cash cost of sales has increased by 5%. In a challenging macro environment, this is a job well done, and I commend our operators for their hard work and for keeping each other safe and for delivering these results. In the first quarter, cash gross profit was $6.53 per ton. Excluding the impact of selling acquired inventory and higher diesel cost, cash gross profit was $6.90 per ton, a 5% improvement over the prior year. Asphalt, cash gross profit of $6 million was in line with the prior year. Pricing actions initiated last year to offset rising liquid asphalt input cost positively impacted the first quarter results. Average selling prices increased 13% versus last year, and helped to improve unit material's margins. The average price of liquid asphalt was over 30% higher than prior year, a $14 million headwind to our first quarter results. While we expect liquid asphalt prices to continue to rise, we are encouraged by the significant sequential improvement that we have seen in pricing over the last couple of quarters. And we remain focused on improving our gross profit margin in asphalt. Concrete cash gross profit grew from $12 million to $49 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by the addition of U.S. Concrete. Volume, price, and material margins all improved as higher selling prices offset higher material cost, including internally supplied Aggregates. Now, let's shift to the demand environment, which remains positive. Private demand is expected to grow in 2022 across all major categories, both single and multi-family housing, and both heavy and more traditional non-residential. Public demand is improving. And as funding is put in place from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, future growth is expected in both highways and other infrastructure. After double-digit growth in 2021, the residential end usage is expected to grow but at a more modest rate in 2022. Demand remains strong and [starts] [Ph] are still positive. However, [with a mountful] [Ph] of factors such as supply chain issues, rising interest rates, and labor constraints. With the continued demand for additional housing, multi-family demand is accelerating. Private non-residential demand has returned to growth in 2022. While demand will continue to be influenced by Aggregates' intensive warehouse and distribution projects, other private segments like office, manufacturing and industrial are now contributing to the sustainable growth in this end market. On the trailing 12-month basis, square footage for total non-residential starts has grown through the last seven months, and is now back to pre-COVID levels. Other external leading indicators like ABI and the Dodge Momentum Index also point towards growth of 2022. On the public side, demand growth is expected in both highways and other infrastructure. The timing of the impact of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would depend upon the pace which states allocate additional funds and the time horizon needed to move from design to letting to construction. As we previously communicated, we anticipate the majority of the impact to be realized in 2023 and beyond. We are well-positioned in attractive markets and are poised to benefit greatly from legislation for years to come. With the solid demand backdrop and positive pricing environment, we remain confident in delivering significant earnings improvement in 2022. We are focused on leveraging our strategic disciplines to control what we can control, and to diminish the impacts of things outside of our control. I will now turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments. Suzanne? Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. The macro challenges of the last 24 months have been well-documented and discussed. We continue to confront these challenges from a position of strength, led by our resilient Aggregates business. Our commercial and operational executions are sound, and supported by our strategic disciplines. Our balance sheet is strong. These factors combine to form our positive 2022 outlook. As Tom already highlighted, our strategic disciplines help us to take advantage of tailwinds and dampen the impact of headwinds. We've done that over the last eight quarters, delivering a 4% compound annual growth rate in our trailing 12-months cash unit margins in the face of a number of challenges. The current pricing environment provides tremendous support for both our near-term and longer term results, and we will continue to leverage best practices, and the collective knowledge of our talented teams to manage our overall costs. This is evident in our SAG cost, which, as a percentage of total revenues declined 60 basis points versus the prior year's quarter. We continue to make progress on the integration of U.S. Concrete to further leverage our cost. Now, with respect to the balance sheet, we took steps in the quarter to improve its structure. We extended the maturity of our $1.1 billion term loan to August, 2026. The loan can be repaid in full, or in part, at any time with no penalty. Simultaneously, we also extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to September, 2026. Our net leverage is 2.6 times. That's just above the top-end of our target range of two to 2.5 times. Given our ability to generate strong cash flows, there is capacity to invest in other opportunities, whether organic or inorganic. Having said that, we do expect to move back within the target range by year-end. As always, we will remain disciplined as allocate capital, with a view to improving shareholder returns and maintaining financial flexibility, and our investment grade ratings. We also remain focused on improving our return on investment. On a trailing 12-months basis, our ROIC at quarter-end was 14%. And our adjusted EBITDA over the same time horizon has improved by 10%. And we expect continued growth in 2022. In February, we communicated expectations for 2022 of delivering adjusted EBITDA between $1.72 billion and $1.82 billion. We reiterate this guidance. We expect the favorable pricing dynamics and our strong execution to lead to attractive growth in Aggregates unit profitability, as well as improvement in our downstream businesses. Our expectation of investing between $600 million and $650 million in capital expenditures remains unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. James Hill : Thank you, Suzanne. In closing, I would like to remind you of three things our teams remain clearly focused on in order to deliver value for all of our stakeholders; one, executing at the local level; two, driving unit margin expansion by focusing on our strategic disciplines; and three, maximizing synergies from recent acquisitions. Our people are what makes Vulcan better every day. And I appreciate the hard work of our entire Vulcan team. I am excited about what we will accomplish in 2022 and for years to come. And now, Suzanne, I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open. Trey Grooms : Hey, good morning, Tom and Suzanne. How are you? James Hill : Good morning, Trey. Good. Suzanne Wood : Hey, good morning. Trey Grooms : Great. Tom, first off, I know you talked a little bit about the pricing environment, and then -- clearly strong, and you have an expectation for price momentum to step up in '22. And I guess if you kind of go back to what you said in February, I think the guidance called for 6% to 8% increase this year in price versus last year -- excuse me, which came in, I think closer to 3%. So, and you put 6% -- you put up 6% in the quarter, so clearly some nice acceleration there. But can you talk about the price momentum you are seeing today, you know, expecting through the year? And how are you thinking about midyear increases relative to maybe where you were a few months ago? James Hill : Sure. I thought the performance in the first quarter was a really good start for the year. As you say, we reported six. Mix adjusted, we were seven. If you remember, in February, we predicted it to start off higher than -- at the low-end of the range, but higher than the fourth quarter last year. And then, we grow it sequentially as we march through the year. That combination of visibility to demand and coming demand, we coupled that with inflation, it's just a good catalyst for price growth. All of our January and April increases are now in place. At this point, I feel very confident about midyear price increases across the vast majority of our work. Now, remember, midyear price increases will have some positive impact on 2022, but because of the delay in our work and our jobs, it's really more of a '23 play. And it sets us up really good for next year. So, off to a really good start. I think we progress and continue to accelerate price as we go through the year, and we're already starting to set ourselves up for 2023. So, as you said a really good pricing environment. Suzanne Wood : And Trey, I will just add one thing just to remind everyone. When we are talking about pricing and guidance, we all price in the industry a little bit differently and talk about it a little bit differently. So, as a reminder, our pricing that we quote to you is freight adjusted, meaning that it's FOB the quarry. And therefore, it excludes transportation to long haul market. So, in times of inflation and volatility, that can make a big difference in the top line price that's quoted. But what's really important here -- and I am sure we will come on to talk about unit margins later, is how much of that price you are really able to take to the bottom line. Trey Grooms : Perfect. Thank you for that. And I am going to stick with the one question, but I do go to take my hats off to on the profit per ton as well that could work on that side as well. Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Trey. James Hill : Thanks, Trey. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you for the question. And -- Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Stanley Elliott : -- it actually was a nice segue for me. Hey, Tom, I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the execution, controlling cost, and freight-adjusted cost up 11%, doing a really nice job on the unit margins, but would love to hear you guys talk a little bit more about what's happening behind the scenes? James Hill : Sure. As we talked about, our Aggregates business, we believe will beat inflation. While we continue do a good job on price, I think our operators have really improved efficiencies to help offset inflation and offset this huge $59 million 12 months spike we've experienced in diesel and Aggregates. And I think they are doing it all the time, making sure they service our customers, and keeps you safe. So, if you kind of look back over the last 12 months, we have held cost to 5% in the face of inflation and massive spikes in fuel and energy. I would tell you, I think that has been an excellent job from our operators, and I appreciate the job they're doing, and as always they do it keeping our folks healthy and safe. And to me, what this demonstrates throughout the whole Aggregates business is that we are executing on our four strategic disciplines, and they're making a difference of, you know, obviously controlling, we are controlled but also offsetting other outside pressures that maybe we had not expected when we started this journey. Stanley Elliott : Thanks, everybody. Best of luck. James Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi, good morning everyone. James Hill : Good morning, Jerry. Suzanne Wood : Hey, good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if you could just talk about the magnitude of inflation that you folks are seeing on labor and other inputs, and what do you expect the cadence of that to look like? In other words, when do we hit an easier comp from that standpoint? And I'm assuming the price realization is going to dovetail nicely with that cadence, but maybe I can get you to expand on price cost, if you don't mind. James Hill : Sure, I'd be glad to. Like everybody else it's everywhere. To call our labor probably bit single-digit, you know, parts are up, hard to get parts, steel is up, rubber is up, everything is there. The headline has to be in fuel, and in energy. If you just look at diesel, we predicted -- I would say, let's look at diesel and asphalt, what we said last quarter was probably a $50 million headwind in the first-half of the year, that's probably going to be 50% higher at this point. We said it probably gets easier in comps in Q3 and 4, and we would probably -- just comp over that, at this point, we still predict those now to be up in Q3 and 4. So, it's tough. It is there. It's real, but as you pointed out, I think we will offset that with price, and we continue to improve our unit margins, which is our job. And I think that if you looked at our guidance, I think both Suzanne and I have confidence that we hit that guidance, and I think the first quarter was evidence of that. Jerry Revich : Okay, thank you. James Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kathryn Thompson with The Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Thompson : Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. Suzanne Wood : Hi, good morning. Kathryn Thompson : So, you have a good volume outlook, and are seeing some areas that have not seen signs of life, including office, and you get to see the real momentum on a state level from public spending, and I guess there's backdrop there, you know, continue to be some supply chain [snappers] [Ph], and your tight increment across the U.S. We are hearing a few concerns about availability of certain types of rock hitting into the peak construction pieces. How are -- first, from your perspective, how is the supply chain journey for you as you manage through business now? And then, how you see it going forward for the remainder of '22 and really into '23 too? Thank you. James Hill : Yes, so, for us, I mean its impact is a little bit, maybe little on efficiencies, with parts for mobile equipment. Hopefully, that's improved, but we saw that for the first time in the first quarter. For our customers, I think it's a little bit different story. I thought -- you know, obviously the first quarter was strong, but remember, we are comping over pretty easy comp with the big freeze in February last year. So, again, it's just Q1 easy comp. The fundamentals in demand I think are really at good place, and price is good as we've seen in a long time, with all foreign uses should have shipments up in 2022. That said, as you pointed out, we have got labor and supply chain issues. Labor will affect our customers just getting -- catching up more than getting it done, but also hurts us in transportation, it hurts the rail transportation, at any peak day with excellent weather you just don't have enough flex to deliver it peak demand, and so it kind of -- it spreads it out. So, as you pointed out, supply chain is just slowing some work. I think while that being said, and the good news is that work is not cancelling; we are not seeing any jobs go away. And so, it's -- while the demand is there, it's not going to waste, it's pushing it to the right and extending the FICO, that's not at all bad. So, if we see some of these pressure ease, I think there is potential for more sooner, but we haven't seen that easing yet as we go into the season. Kathryn Thompson : Thank you very much. James Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Keith Hughes with Chouest Securities. Keith Hughes : Thank you. [Indiscernible] particularly asphalt, given some of the inflation seeing in that sector with the flat year-over-year performance. I guess my question is next quarter or two, is there some recent inflation you're going to lag, just kind of put some pressure or do you think you are on the right side of cost now? James Hill : I think Q2 we will see some pressure as we pointed out, because it's still a harder comp. We haven't seen the big jump in -- you start to see the inflation last year in Q2, but not the big jump in diesel and liquid. So, Q2 has tougher comps. It kind of -- in all product lines, driven by energy. From a specific asphalt perspective, I was very pleased with the jump we saw in prices up 13%, remember that we said in our guidance for asphalt that we see gross profit grow driven by second-half volumes in second-half, the modern growth. I think that in the quarter we saw liquid go up 130 bucks, or $14 million, and the fact that we were able to offset it with price is a really good omen looking forward to the rest of the year. I think we caught it, and I think as we progress through the year we start growing those unit margins in asphalt. Keith Hughes : Okay, thank you. James Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Oh, hi, thanks, and congrats on the quarter. I was just wondering if you can go to a little bit more detail just on the volume, growth expectations for the rest of the year, clearly Q1 up against a fairly easy comparison, but anything which consider as the demand environment continues to improve for you? James Hill : Yes. Again, we will stick to our guidance, with five to seven kind of on volume growth that's two to four same-store, again, a great start, again, easy comp, easy -- small quarter. I would call out this, I would stick to that guidance, and at this point until I see someone ease, you know, as we heard earlier you've got labor issues, you got supply chain issues, you could have demand issues, being tied, I don't think it dampens volumes that much, but you know, I don't see that easing at this point. So, I would stick with our volume, original growth until we see more. Suzanne Wood : And I think like we said last quarter, I mean if there is you know, an easing, then we stand ready to benefit from that. Garik Shmois : Yes, understood. Thank you. James Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. Congratulations on the great quarter. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. David MacGregor : And pretty impressive -- Suzanne Wood : Thank you. David MacGregor : -- impressive results. I guess I wanted to ask about the EBITDA guidance range, the 172-182, and that's not changing, but obviously a lot within that is changing, and just responding to Garik's question, you just talked about volume growth, where you were in terms of beginning of your assumptions, and clearly, pricing is going to be a lot better. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about that cash cost inflation in that mid single-digit number you gave us back in February? James Hill : Yes. So, I think that -- I think as I look at the year and just puts and takes to the year after one quarter, and it's just the first quarter, I would say that's probably upside, maybe to the high-end of our pricing guidance, maybe upside on volume, although we haven't seen it yet, I think we will have challenges, we knew we were going to have challenges on diesel, we got bigger challenges there than we had anticipated. We knew we were going to have challenges on liquid asphalt; again, that has climbed more than we thought it would, and it will continue to climb. So, we put all that together, I would tell you that I have good confidence in our guidance. It would need to see little bit more before I would be willing to adjust it. David MacGregor : Okay. Thank you very much. James Hill : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng : Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter. Suzanne Wood : Thank you. Philip Ng : John and Suzanne, is there a good way to think about the midyear increase from a contribution standpoint, and if demand remains pretty good, do you see this being more of the knock norm, and appreciating that, you know, the full impact is really more of a 2023 event. Can you get closer to like double-digit pricing from an increase standpoint in the back-half of this year? Sorry, a lot of impact there. James Hill : No, that's okay. I think that if you step back and just look at the Aggregates business, one of the really attractive attributes of Aggregates is its pricing and elasticity. And from Vulcan's perspective, it's ability to compound unit margins over time. That is specifically why we are in the Aggregates business, that's why we are leading that business, that's why 90% of our gross profit is in Aggregates. Today the environment for price growth is excellent, and it's really driven by the intersection of inflation, current demand, and visibility to growing demand. You've seen us sequentially grow price over the last five quarters, and I'm confident we will continue that trend. So, we started off at six or seven, depending on how you call the price in the quarter, and I think each quarter will continue to grow that as we progress forward. At this point I would hope we will be at the higher end of that guidance, at this point. Now, if you really want to be good at this business, you got to take that price to the bottom line, which is why we work so hard on those strategic disciplines, and why it's not just about price, it's also about cost control and operating efficiencies. And so, the combination of those two at this point, you know, even in the face of what we face with inflation, I think our troops are doing an excellent job both in servicing our customers, earning price, but also operating in the most efficient manner possible under some pretty tough circumstances. Suzanne Wood : Yes, Phil, and I think you see that, you know, when you look at the guidance we called out at the beginning of the year if you look at that cash gross profit per ton, and the guidance range is that we've given call for that to go up, you know, high single-digits year-over-year. And I would say at any time, that's a good performance to be able to drive that to that level, but taking into consideration, all of the energy headwinds we've talked about and the inflation, despite the opportunity for some price increases, that's a performance I would really be proud of. Philip Ng : For sure, I mean given all the inflation you saw improving in 1Q is pretty promising. Appreciate the color. Suzanne Wood : Yes, sure. James Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Mark, Suzanne, and Tom. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. James Hill : Good morning. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Tom, if you could share your thoughts on how the U.S. Concrete integration is going relative to plan? And one of the puts and takes you've seen over the first several months of having [indiscernible] family? And is the New York kind of like northeast market, we hear about a lot of civil, lot of work coming through various agencies, are you seeing some of that through this year and going out into the next quarter? James Hill : Yes, we are. New York I think, two things happening to New York, the public demand is growing and there are some very big projects that are in the works. And now we are starting to see non-res up there starting to pop. So, good news is that market. If you step back and look at U.S. Concrete, at this point, we're functioning as one business. That's combined field teams, operating as one team, you heard me say last quarter the timing is turning out to be excellent for two reasons, as we talked about non-residential demand, which is so important to Concrete is in growth mode, and there is a lot of work coming in non across our footprint. And in pricing, in all product lines, as we talked about is really jumping in 2022. So, it sets us up really well for that acquisition to create even more value for our shareholders. Michael Dudas : Thank you. James Hill : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Courtney Yakavonis : Hi, good morning, guys. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Courtney Yakavonis : Just one clarification on the price income comments and we've been talking a lot about the mid years, but is your reiterated guidance includes the upside from mid-years at the high-end, or I think last quarter you characterized it as not including mid years and if so, just wanted to understand if that changed, given the elevated diesel in liquid asphalt headwind that you are now breaking in. And then secondly, on the downstream side, you've given us some guidance for gross profit last quarter and a change to how we should be thinking about those business lines? James Hill : Yes, so the pricing I would point out would still be in that six to eight, we're probably on the high end of it, and you got to remember that mid-year price increases will hit some of it in May, some of June, some of July. But because the lag in our business, you'll get some benefit in '22. But it really sets you up that we're most of that work is going to hit in '23. So it's -- well, you'll see some benefit and pushes I would say to the high end of that range. The big benefit is going to hit in '23. And that's great. I think from a downstream perspective, we would tell you it's the same, a no change and guidance. Again, what we said was 300 to 325 cash gross profit in the downstream, while we've seen inflationary pressures in both products, both concrete and asphalt. We're also seeing price and I would stick with our guidance and continue to grow our unit margins in volume, particularly second half loaded. Courtney Yakavonis : Okay, great. James Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just following up I mean with the pricing now at the high-end, or what you started, so where you exited. I mean, what kind of incremental should we be thinking about for next year if you're looking at a 10% to 12% pricing in 2023, should this basically just cash gross profit per ton, which is growing high single-digit, how much is that accelerating should we thinking about in 2023? And really think about those incrementals around that, that business? James Hill : Yes. Well, too early to call pricing and 2023. Again, it's nice set up with medium price increases. And I would always point you in aggregates to 6% incremental same store and I would 60%, same store and inflation puts pressure on that particularly spikes in diesel. But if you look at over the long-term, that's where I would guide you that 60%. Michael Feniger : Okay. And can gross margin and asphalt rate mix, can that get back to 2020 levels next year? I know you're assuming that there's improved in the second half of this year. So with next year, if we get some moderation or just stabilization on these price increases, can we see those margins come back? Or do you think there's something structural that, that keeps those margins in those in the downstream businesses from getting back to those levels? James Hill : I'll remind you that 2020 was special for asphalt because of the shortfall in liquid prices. And so, it was probably an outlier, whereas '21 was also an outlier. The other way with a spike in liquid is somewhere in between those two and I think we get back to normal -- more normalized. I don't think there's anything structurally change in asphalt. I think you just saw huge swings in liquid, which is abnormal, but we'll get back to more normalized margins in asphalt and I think we were on our path there with what you saw in the first quarter. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Suzanne Wood : Yes, I want to just add here, I mean, it's look we had a really good first quarter and we're really excited about that our people worked very hard to deliver that and we're very appreciative to them for their efforts. And I think we certainly saw good performance in price. We said we're confident in mid-year price increases and so while those are great to talk about I just want to caution people, let's not forget that there's a bit of another side to that equation. We've seen cost pressures, Tom talked about those in terms of energy and other inflation. So, when we reiterated our EBITDA guidance, we're really trying to take into effect that both of those items. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning, guys. Suzanne Wood : Good morning. Adam Thalhimer : Just a quick one on residential, Tom, you said that -- I think you said residential decelerating growth this year. What are you hearing from some of your major home building clients? Then maybe you can even kind of do a geographic walk for us? Thanks. James Hill : Yes. The geographic walk is pretty easy. It's widespread. It's everywhere for residential. The housing market is just tight. Every market we operate in maybe the exception of Illinois, but every play. Even that one is not -- still got some tightness to it, but you can't find houses. I think residential demand continues to operate at a very high level. You still have supply chain issues. Again, demand is very good. Obviously, we'll see growth in 2022. I just don't think it's the white hot level that we saw in '21 in single family. Now multi-family permits and starts were up double digit. So, it's really heating up. Overall, res continues in -- both single family and multi-family operates at a very high level and continues to be good. And I don't think it's slowing down. I think the growth rate may have slowed a little bit. But, it would have been tough to keep up with that rate we saw in '21. Suzanne Wood : We are still in high levels. James Hill : So growth is maybe not is not at the level of growth that we saw in '21, but really good news. Adam Thalhimer : Understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : Hi, thank you, and good morning. Hey, Tom, there has been some discussion about delays in certain infrastructure projects just because the cost sort of advanced beyond the original estimates, have to go back and kind of re-bid it. Is that something you have seen become more pervasive across your markets? And any sense if that's had any effect at all in terms of slowing some of the good momentum, and I think that piece of your business should otherwise be doing? James Hill : I don't think -- I don't know that I have experienced the delays from inflation. I think when it comes to non-highway infrastructure we should see growth in 2022. Starts in the last three months were up 16%. New subdivision work helps this segment. And I think it's -- we are well-positioned for some really big jobs that are coming in that sector. And everything from lot repairs to airports to wind, farm work, and rail [indiscernible], I think it continues to grow in '22 and '23. Brent Thielman : Okay, thank you. James Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Chris Kalata : Hi, it's actually Chris Kalata for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. I understand that you guys still feel comfortable with your prior volume outlook. But, I just want to get a sense of the flexibility around that again in terms of supply chain pressures and limiting factor that is on your outlook. Have supply chains improved at all this quarter? And, what's your outlook there for the remainder of the year? James Hill : No, I would say the supply chain is still tight. I haven't seen any improvement. Labor is still tight. It doesn't impact to as much in Q1 because the volumes aren't at a high level they are in Q2 and Q3 in the construction season. So, you are not operating at high enough level to dampen it, which is what we are going to see in Q2 - Q3. And it is supply chain from everything from windows to doors to doorknobs, to switchgear to plumbing to pipe. It's just everywhere. And in the labor piece, not only dampens the construction companies but also dampens as I talk about transportation both rail -- the railroads are operating below -- it has been struggling as everybody knows to beat demand because they cannot get crews. And then as I said, they were short on trucks in peak shipping time. Again, I don't think it does away with demand. I just think it pushes it out and probably extended the cycle, so not all bad news, although we would like to ship as much as we can every day. If we don't get to it in the next quarter, the next quarter, it will get to it the next year, so, not all bad news. Hopefully, that will ease up some as we progress through year. And again, if that happens we will take advantage of it. And we will adjust and we will communicate to you. But, right now we just don't see it. Chris Kalata : Understood. Appreciate the color. James Hill : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer portion. It is now my pleasure to turn the call back over to Mr. Tom Hill for any closing remarks. James Hill : Thank you, Operator. Listen, I thank all of you for your interest in Vulcan Materials, and your time today. We hope that you and your families stay safe, and we look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Bye-bye. Suzanne Wood : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program, and we thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

My name is Katie, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mary Andrews Carlisle, Vice President of Finance. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our website, vulcanmaterials.com. A recording of this call will be available for replay later today at our website. Please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation and other SEC filings. As the operator indicated, please limit your Q&A participation to one question. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Our teams delivered another solid performance in a challenging macro environment. The resilient nature of our aggregates-led business actually stands out in times like these. We've grown our cash gross profit per ton in 15 of the last 16 quarters and expanded our trailing 12-month unit profitability at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.5% over that 4-year period. These consistent results come from our unwavering commitment to executing on our strategic disciplines, which allows us to capitalize on pricing opportunities to mitigate cost pressures and to drive improvement in unit profitability. During the second quarter, we grew our aggregates cash gross profit per ton despite significant external headwinds. Importantly, our year-over-year improvement expanded sequentially each month. We are poised to carry this momentum forward and deliver both aggregates cash unit profitability growth and double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth this year. We generated $450 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year. These results include an approximate $20 million impact from the unexpected and arbitrary shutdown of our operation in Mexico in May. The results were also hampered by ongoing energy cost headwinds and other inflationary pressures. Pricing improvement was robust across all product lines. Year-over-year growth in aggregates mix-adjusted price has increased sequentially for 6 quarters. Both asphalt and ready-mix delivered strong double-digit price improvement, which helped cost set rising energy costs. Turning now to each segment. Aggregates gross profit improved 8% to $402 million. Demand remained healthy across our footprint during the second quarter with the majority of geographies showing shipment growth. Overall, volume improved 9% or 2% on a same-store basis. Ongoing pricing momentum helped margins return to growth in the second quarter. Freight adjusted pricing increased 9% over the prior year's quarter. Mix-adjusted pricing improved 10%. We expect continued momentum through the balance of the year as second half price increases and new project work backlog at higher prices begin to flow through into the third quarter. Operator : In the second quarter, aggregates cash gross profit improved 2% to $7.99 per ton. In the Asphalt segment, both volume and pricing improvements were geographically dispersed. Pricing actions that began last year usually a 19% improvement in average selling prices in the quarter and helped to mitigate a $33 million energy headwind. Volumes improved 9%, asphalt cash gross profit in the quarter held 2021 levels, despite the significant year-over-year increases in liquid asphalt and natural gas costs. Concrete cash gross profit in the second quarter benefited from the addition of U.S. Concrete, growing from $14 million in the prior year to $51 million this year. Volume, price and material margins all improved as higher selling prices offset higher material costs. Continued improvement in private nonresidential construction activity and the onset of infrastructure investment remain catalysts for the concrete segment. Now let's shift to the broader demand environment. We continue to expect private and public demand to grow in 2022. Residential construction activity in the second half of 2022 will remain good and multifamily permits and starts are showing particular strength. Headwinds to single-family construction have resulted in slowing permits and starts, but after multiple years of strong growth, single-family construction remains at high levels, and Vulcan states continue to outperform the U.S. average. Private nonresidential demand has returned to growth and has broadened in 2022 beyond aggregate-intensive warehouses and distribution projects to now include other nonresidential categories like office, manufacturing and institutional work. On a trailing 12-month basis, square footage for total private nonresidential starts has grown 20% in bulk-and-serve markets and is now above pre-COVID levels. Other leading indicators like the Architecture Billings Index and the Dodge Momentum Index also point towards growth. The ABI remains in positive growth territory, and the Dodge Momentum Index hit a 14-year high in June. On the public side, we've entered growth mode. And while public demand has somewhat -- has been somewhat muted in the first half of the year, we anticipate secondhand growth in both highways and infrastructure. The bidding and booking activity we saw in the second quarter reflected record levels of public funding. In addition, we anticipate that the federal infrastructure investment and Jobs Act funding will begin to flow into shipments in 2023 and for years to come. Now remember, the ultimate timing of the impact of the IIJA will depend upon the pace at which states continue to allocate additional funds and the time horizon needed to move from design to letting to construction. Overall, our markets are positioned to continue to outperform other parts of the country, and our strong execution and tireless commitment to expanding our unit margins will ensure that we continue to drive value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Suzanne and Mary Andrews to comment further on our results and the full year outlook. Suzanne? Suzanne Wood : Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. As I reflect on the first half of this year, I'm pleased with our 14% adjusted EBITDA growth that was driven by a strong performance in aggregates, which Tom described, and SAG cost leverage. Our strategic discipline helped us confront and overcome macro challenges in the current dynamic operating environment. In regards to SAG, we reduced this cost as a percentage of revenue by 50 basis points in the first half to 7.3%, and we are positioned to further leverage cost by the end of the year. I'm also pleased that our net leverage was reduced to 2.5x EBITDA, the top end of our stated target range of 2x to 2.5x. Our balance sheet is strong, and our significant cash generation capabilities give us the capacity to continue to invest in both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Disciplined capital management remains fundamental to our strategy. Our capital decisions are made with the goal of improving shareholder returns and return on invested capital, while maintaining financial flexibility and our investment-grade credit ratings. On a trailing 12 months basis, our ROIC at quarter end was 13.6%. Our adjusted EBITDA over the same time horizon increased by 13%, and we expect continued improvement. I'll now turn the call over to Mary Andrews to provide more details on our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Mary Andrews. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning all. It is a pleasure to take part in this quarter's call. In February, we communicated expectations for 2022 of delivering adjusted EBITDA between $1.72 billion and $1.82 billion. Today, we are providing an update to our full year guidance. Our update reflects both the previously disclosed $80 million to $100 million impact from the loss of our Mexico business, in addition to other adjustments related to higher-than-anticipated inflationary pressures. We now expect adjusted EBITDA for the full year between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. We expect mid-single-digit growth in aggregates cash gross profit per ton for the full year. The strong pricing momentum we have seen in the first half is expected to continue, and we now expect aggregates freight adjusted prices to increase between 9% and 11% for the year. We continue to expect aggregates volume improvement of 5% to 7%. We are also revising our expectations for the Asphalt segment due to the continued escalation of liquid asphalt costs. Asphalt earnings for the full year are now expected to approximate full year 2021, benefiting from solid shipment growth and aggressive pricing actions that are offsetting the significantly higher energy costs. I'll run through a few other components that may be helpful for modeling purposes. SAG expenses are expected to be between $495 million and $505 million. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $165 million. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion is expected to be approximately $565 million. The effective tax rate is estimated between 21% and 22%. We plan to spend between $600 million and $650 million on capital expenditures in 2022. These expenditures include both maintenance and growth projects. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews, and a special thank you to Suzanne. As we previously announced, this will be Suzanne's last earnings call. You hear me say this a lot, but it's the people of Vulcan to make this place special. And Suzanne is, for sure, one of those people. Suzanne, we're grateful for your tenure, and we appreciate your leadership. And it's been -- and your leadership has been -- played a critical role in our success over the last 4 years in our ability to deliver enhanced profitability and higher returns on capital despite pressures like pandemics and inflation. And while Suzanne's business skills are tremendous, I think what I'll miss most is her caring touch. And I think what the organization will miss is how she welcomes all in and made us feel a part of the Vulcan family. Suzanne, we wish you the best in your retirement. We'll miss you greatly. We want to thank you. Well, make sure you go take care of those grandbabies. I want to also thank the entire Vulcan team for your hard work and your success. I'm excited about where we've been, but I'm more excited about what we're going to accomplish the rest of 2022 and beyond. First and foremost, on keeping our people safe as we've shown in our industry-leading safety performance. And we are focused on delivering value to our shareholders by executing at the local level, driving unit margin expansion through our strategic disciplines and maximizing the synergies from recent acquisitions. We look forward to seeing all of you in New York in September for our Investor Day. And now Suzanne, Mary Andrews, and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Starting off, I mean, there's a tremendous amount of volatility in the market right now. Has it changed your view on where we are in the cycle? And maybe could you point to some things that you're seeing in the market that give you confidence that things really haven't changed all that materially? Tom Hill : Stanley, I think as an investor, I'd ask 3 critical questions. The first question would be what's going to happen with price? And I think that's a pretty easy question to answer. Price is very good. It's getting better, and it's going to continue for the foreseeable future. We've seen times where we had double-digit pricing, and usually when that happens, it's a multiyear trend. Second question would be, okay, in the face of inflation, can you take that price to the bottom line? And simply, yes. We saw an inflection point in the second quarter. Margins were back in growth in May, kind of low single digit, then they grew to mid-single digit in June. So margins are in expansion mode. And then we're going to have mid-year price increases. So pricing is now outpacing inflation. And I'd like to take you back to a critical fundamental of our aggregates business, and that is that aggregate pricing is inelastic, but diesel cost or not. And then the third question would be what's going to happen with demand and shipments in the foreseeable future? And I think the answer to that one is we see demand continuing to grow, maybe in a little bit different format, so less single-family, more multifamily, really growing non-res and a lot more infrastructure. So you put all those 3 questions together, I think our business is set up for success for the next few years. Stanley Elliott : That's great. And Suzanne, best wishes to you. Suzanne Wood : Thank you, Stanley. Operator : Our next question will come from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms : The cash gross profit, I wanted to touch on that. Cash gross profit per ton increased in the quarter, which is pretty impressive given the headwinds, and you're looking for, I think, the revised guide is a mid-single-digit improvement for the year, which it does imply a pretty strong pickup in the back half. So how should we be thinking about the progression there? And I'm assuming that, that will imply a pretty strong exit rate and bode well for profitability going into next year. So any color you could give there would be helpful. Tom Hill : Yes. So as I talked about earlier, if you looked at May, we were up, say, 2% of unit margins; June, say, 5%. You've got another price jump in July. We're also adding higher bidding prices in the second half. We see -- the cost inflation, it's not just going to go down, but it's not going to continue accelerating like it has. And that would point us to what I'd say high single-digit unit margins in the second half. So really, we've recovered -- as we always do, we'll take the inflationary hit. Our pricing lags, but we'll jump it and we'll go back in the growth mode. And I'd say that unit margins will be very good in the second half, and we'll carry that momentum into '23. Trey Grooms : And best wish to Suzanne for the retirement. Suzanne Wood : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Just wondering if you could speak a little bit more on the infrastructure side. Coming into the quarter, you were still expecting this -- the first half of this year to reflect a bit of an air pocket due to bidding activity that was a little bit slower in the back half of last year. I'm just wondering, you've got some slides that have reflected an increase. I'm just wondering if what you're seeing on the ground and kind of what the expectations are just [indiscernible] moving forward...? Tom Hill : And I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the first part of your question. Are you talking about the entire [mark] or specific end use like highways? Garik Shmois : Yes. Sorry, I was speaking specifically to highways. Tom Hill : Sure. I think it was slow as we had predicted in the first half because states kind of hit the pause button in the second half of last year to kind of see what's going to happen with their budgets. The fundamentals, I think, for multiyear growth in infrastructure and highways is very good. At this point, you've got state, county, city tax revenues at extremely high levels, and that is prior to IIJA. We've seen substantial bidding booked work in infrastructure in the last 90 days. And embedded in that in the recent backlog as a number of multiyear big, big projects and again, prior to IIJA. So the bidding and backlog growth should continue for the balance of this year. And then I think the DOT budgets as we look forward to next year, are starting to reflect the 38% funding increase from IIJA plus, on top of that, their substantial funding going into this. So we predicted the growth. We saw it in the biddings in the second quarter. We think that continues for this year and well into '23 and '24. Operator : Our next question will come from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : On the updated guidance, if we strip out Mexico, I think there's $30 million from higher costs, if I got that right. I'm just wondering if you can put any finer point on that $30 million diesel energy, I don't know, labor or if there's other things that we should be thinking about there? Tom Hill : Yes. It's really energy. And, I mean, diesel from the second half to the -- first half to the second half is probably about in line, but you still have other inflationary pressures in there and labor continue to escalate a little bit. But it's primarily just all the flow-through of all the inflationary inputs and services that we have in that business. Suzanne Wood : Yes, Anthony. I'd just add that, that extra $30 million, you'll see the majority of that in the Asphalt segment due to continued higher liquid in the back half. And then you'll know we also raised the SAG guide just a bit, which is related to some business development expenses and other legal costs related to Mexico. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on Mexico, understanding the guidance adjustment, can you just remind us of the timeline for potential NAFTA arbitration and sort of the remedies that you're pursuing there? Tom Hill : Yes. So with the shutdown in May, we filed an application in the NAFTA arbitration to seek additional claims because of the shutdown. In July, the Tribunal granted our application to seek those further claims, and we should hope to hear a decision sometime in 2023. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And Suzanne, thanks so much for all the help over the years. Suzanne Wood : Sure. I enjoyed it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Suzanne and Mary Andrews, congratulations once again to you both. Suzanne we'll miss working with you. I'm wondering if I could just ask, as you folks look at what every outlook for aggregates percent margin performance is embedded over the balance of the year, if we back out the impact of the unfortunate situation in Mexico, do you expect year-over-year percent gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter just based on the pricing actions that you folks have announced? And similarly, can you just talk about the cadence of organic volume expectations now that we have to contend with not being able to ship from Mexico, it looks like over the next couple of quarters? Suzanne Wood : Yes. I think on the gross margins in the back half, like Tom said, we really view the second quarter as having been an inflection point with pricing beginning to accelerate faster than the cost. And so we would expect to see gross margins begin to improve in the back half. Tom Hill : Go ahead. I'm sorry. Jerry Revich : I apologize, I was just going to ask, is that a year-over-year margin expansion Tom or sequential? Suzanne Wood : I think we'll see sequentially the challenges that we've had in gross margin in the first half and the inflationary pressures will abate some in the second half. Jerry Revich : And I apologize, Tom, did you want to add on the volume point? Tom Hill : Yes. You asked about volumes, and I would tell you that what's in the guidance is growth of roughly low single digit. I would tell you to point out that the underlying demand in the market, I think, is a lot stronger than that, particularly with the growth we're seeing in nonres and infrastructure. The second half, as I said, we'll see growth, but you've got some headwinds there. And it's namely -- the biggest one is going to be Mexico. Second would be lack of rail service. We just can't get enough product to the coastal markets. And the third and fourth one would be just truck shortages at peak time capacity and then some cement charges in the market. As we look further out, I think the demand drivers are shifting. You've got single-family leading indicators, not as robust, but we think that -- well, it's still at really high levels, but we think that's offset by 3 factors : One, multifamily construction remains extremely strong; two, non-residential construction continues to improve; and three, as we talked about, highways and infrastructure bookings are showing considerable strength in the last 90 days, and that's prior to IIJA and that will only get better in the second half of this year going into '23. And remember that -- you got to remember that Vulcan markets enjoy considerable population growth. So our demand profile will grow faster than the rest of the country. Operator : Our next question will come from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Brian Biros : This is actually Brian Biros on for Kathryn. We've been hearing increased concern from state DOTs that inflation is beginning to impact their ability to address their work programs. So I guess, in addition to labor and material shortages, are you seeing inflation impact the public work programs at all? Tom Hill : You hear about jobs not being awarded due to being over the engineers' estimates because of inflation, and we think that's really the exception, not the norm. The place that we've seen a little bit of that is in Georgia. But even in Georgia, they postponed 8% of work where they normally do about 1%. And I would underline postpone, they don't go away with it, they just said, hey, we're going to wait and see what happens with inflation. And so those jobs don't go away. But most states -- that's more of the exception of the rule. Most states are pushing work through despite inflationary costs, for example, I think, Texas and Arizona DOTs have been real clear about that they're going ahead with their scheduled programs. And you have to remember that the DOT funds are extremely high levels right now, and that's prior to the big increase in federal funds. You've got gas tax revenues at insanely high levels. You got extra COVID funds. So at this point, the DOTs have been aggressively bidding their work since February, March. And we're seeing that in our bookings and backlogs as we talked about. So I actually don't think it's a big issue for most of the DOTs. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Chris Kalata : It's actually Chris Kalata on for Mike. Just going back to the Mexican quarry disruptions. I was hoping you could help flesh out more detail how you plan to backfill those lost shipments. I mean, is there an opportunity to potentially backfill that through M&A, still plan to utilize the ships you've made over the years? And how do you plan to address the disruptions and continue to serve those Gulf markets? Tom Hill : Yes. At this point, that's not in our guidance. In fact, that's -- well, we took the $80 million to $100 million hit. We're not backfilling those tons. You'd say, well, can't you just rail down there? The fact of the matter is we can't get the rail service for our normal business increases that we normally use. So at this point, we don't have that in our plan. Chris Kalata : Understood. And if I can just follow-up. Is there any sort of contingency plan in place if you were to primarily lose access to that part? Tom Hill : To be seen. I don't see at this point because of the lack of rail service. But we'll -- as we -- as time goes on, we'll keep you updated. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : You're hosting Investor Day in September, I mean, provider framework was in 2019. So now you're seeing strong cost control, higher pricing, that is likely to stick as diesel costs peak. So would that not lead to a higher cash gross profit per ton long term? Just trying to assess as we go forward now the incremental margin, operating margins that you kind of see in 2023 and going forward based on how pricing is going to exit this year and the costs have likely peaked? Tom Hill : Now, you're going to steal my thunder for my Investor Day. Yes, you pointed out. Look, as we said in the prepared remarks, we're at $7.99 per ton. So -- and our long range have been $9. So we're rapidly approaching that. Obviously, this is a continuous improvement journey. And so we'll hope to give you some -- you guys some new goals and a path to those goals as we talk in September, and I think we'll have a full morning of that at the end of September. Operator : Our next question will come from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Tom, in responding to an earlier question, you talked about a number of factors that were influencing volume. And one of those you mentioned was just cement tightness. So I'm just wondering if there's a way to talk about the extent to which cement availability or lack thereof may be adversely impacting your aggregates business, not just this quarter, but heading out through the next 5 or 6 quarters. And then if I may, just you talked about the book business and the inflection you've seen there in the last 90 days. What's your expectation in terms of the timing of that becoming visible in the revenues? Tom Hill : Yes. So the cement issue -- for aggregates volumes, it's not as big a deal as the Mexico or the rail. It's a little bit here, a little bit there. I'm not sure that if you have the cement, you'd have the trucks to deliver the aggregates or the trucks deliver the concrete itself. But you kind of -- that's why I kind of put it with the cement and the trucking. So it is there. I don't see it as a big headwind. And I think there would be other governors that would take over if all the cement was there. As far as -- and I think -- what was the second part of your question about margin expansion? David MacGregor : Well, just on the cement, I guess, if I could delve on that for a moment, but my concern was more with respect to 2023 as volume ramps, and it seems like cement capacity is constrained and the extent to which that might inflect. I'm not so much interested in this quarter, more thinking about how you're thinking about the next 6 quarters. And then -- sorry, go ahead. Tom Hill : My answer applied to the balance of this year, I didn't really get into '23, but that was a little bit of a governor advance for this year, but I don't think it's one of the major ones. David MacGregor : Okay. And then the second part was just the business that you see booked over the last 90 days, that inflection. What's your best estimate in terms of the timing of that becoming visible revenues for you? Tom Hill : Well, I think it became visible in May. It became more visible where unit margins were up 2% in June. They went up 5%. We're predicting them go up high single digits in the second half. So I think we're here and we're in the middle of it, and it's growing rapidly. Operator : Our next question will come from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Tom, I wanted to ask about -- you talked about this demand rotation. When do you think that the percentage of revenue from infrastructure could increase materially? Tom Hill : I think you see it ramping up in the second half of this year, and then it ramps up some more in '23 and a lot more in '24. So you've got -- I mean, what's really impacting this year is not the federal fund increase, and federal funds, it is gas tax and COVID funds. That probably is the majority of the ramp-up in the first half of '23, and then you've got the big jump in federal funds, I think, hitting second half in '23 and '24. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Maybe for Suzanne or Mary. You highlighted the capital spending outlook this year. So if it's going to accelerate second half versus first half, given what you've released. Maybe a little bit of where that's spending the growth? And is there growth projects without giving out budgets for next year that could be multiyear ahead given some of the delays from COVID? And is there a target on the 2x to 2.5x level on the net debt ratio, but given the spending and with deposit cash flow you're generating, that more capital allocation to shareholders could be bought for? Is that something maybe we save for the September Investor Day? Suzanne Wood : Yes, sure. As Mary Andrews has indicated, the CapEx outlook for this year remains at $600 million to $650 million. We've talked about this before. That's a little higher than what it has been in the last couple of years just because we had various things impacting that, namely the pandemic, and most recently, the supply chain has made it difficult to take in some of that equipment that we had planned to be delivered last year. So this year is a little bit higher. Probably 2/3 or so of that is directed towards what we refer to as operating CapEx. That's the first pillar of our capital allocation strategy because it's important that we maintain the value of the valuable franchise we have. And therefore, it's super important that we keep our equipment in very good working order. And certainly, as you look forward, potentially volatile times from a macro perspective, it's important that your equipment remain in good shape and good utility because that gives you the ability if you needed to reduce CapEx going forward for a few years. So we're comfortable with where we are on CapEx. With respect to growth, certainly, we have invested in a number of sales yards over the years in certain markets that act as virtual quarries for us and help us distribute aggregates to customers. We also have a number of greenfield projects, which we do a number of those if we have a growth quarter in which there isn't a company that we're interested in from an M&A perspective. Some of those more recent greenfield sites have been California, Georgia, Texas and South Carolina. So we're comfortable with the level of spending. We think it's appropriate for the size of our business now and puts us in good shape going forward. With respect to the leverage target, it was important for us following the U.S. Concrete acquisition to get ourselves back within the range. So we were pleased to get to the top end of that range at 2.5x. And having gotten within that range, I think that we will continue down the path of it's important to stay within the range with what we have in front of us. I think we are well able to do that. And the capital allocation priorities have been in place for a long time. They have put us in good shape. Our return on investment has increased 40 or 50 basis points over the last 2 or 3 years. And so we will continue to follow those capital allocation priorities. Operator : Our next question will come from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Collin Verron : This is actually Collin on for Phil. I just wanted to touch on aggregates pricing. You guys are implementing the midyear price increases. You talked about increasing bid work pricing. And even one of your large competitors talked about targeted 4Q price increases. So just given these dynamics, can you talk about how you're thinking about the magnitude of sequential price improvement in Q3 and Q4? And help us think about the magnitude of carryover pricing that you would expect in 2023? Tom Hill : Yes. So in the quarter, as we said, it was up 9%, 10% of mix adjusted. I think it's important to your point to note the cadence of pricing within the quarter. So April was up 7%, May was up 9%, June was up 10% and we'll continue to see that sequential pricing as we progress through the second half. To your point, it's supported by widespread July price increases, you've got bid work continue to go up, you're replacing old work with higher price bid work. And so I think if you look at the second half, we're probably in 12% or 13% -- for the total second half, 6 months, we're probably in the 12% to 13% range. And as you pointed out, we ended the quarter at 10%, so that will continue to step up as we go through the year. And to your point, that will also set us up really well for 2023 as most of the work that we bid in the third and fourth quarter will ship next year. So we'll go into it with significantly higher prices as we start the year, so a big advantage to us to kick off 2023 with much higher pricing. Operator : Our next question will come from Jean Ramirez with D.A. Davidson. Jean Ramirez : This is Jean Ramirez for Brent Thielman. My first question is, to what extent are cement outages and allocations impacting your volumes and ready-mix? Should that innovate in the second half? Tom Hill : So I would tell you minor, a little bit here and there kind of some peak times. It's not just cement, it's also trucking for aggregates. It's also ready-mix truck operators. So there's a whole bunch of things that plays into that. So that is a piece of it, but I'd say it all kind of just blends together. So it's more peak time kind of end of the week, but it's -- so it's a little bit, but there's a lot of other factors besides just cement. Jean Ramirez : Great. And if you don't mind, just a quick follow-up. Given the impact of the Mexico operations, are there any plans today to try and alternatively serve those markets that rely on that product? Tom Hill : Not at this point, and that's really driven by lack of rail service. Operator : At this time, I am showing no further questions. I'll now turn the program back over to Tom for any additional or closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you all for your interest and your time for Vulcan Materials this morning. We appreciate it very much. We hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy, and we really look forward to seeing you at the end of September for our Investor Day in New York. Thank you and have a great day. Suzanne Wood : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Gretchen, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Mary Andrews Carlisle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A couple of housekeeping items before I turn the call over to Tom. First, please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the Company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation and other SEC filings. In the interest of time, please limit your Q&A participation to one question. This will allow for more questions during our time together. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our website, vulcanmaterials.com. Additionally, a recording of this call will be available for replay later today at our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to each of you for joining the call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. During the third quarter, our team showcased the durable growth capabilities of our aggregates-led business model. Volumes, prices, gross profit, and importantly unit profitability improved in each of our operating segments. Widespread double-digit pricing growth across all segments outpaced continued cost pressures. Our momentum is strong. Throughout our organization, we remain focused on our strategic disciplines, the Vulcan way of operating and the Vulcan way of selling, and the fundamental role they play as we continue to enhance our core business. We also continue to expand our reach and we've closed several strategic acquisitions this year. Importantly, during the third quarter, we acquired strategic aggregates and downstream assets to complement our existing business in Northern California. In the third quarter, we generated $507 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is a 21% increase over the prior year. Accelerating pricing growth and higher year-over-year shipments drove earnings improvement in each product line. In aggregates, gross profit improved 17% to $436 million. Volume improved 9% or 3% on a same-store basis, and it was geographically widespread. Pricing momentum continued growing from mid single-digit in the first quarter to high single-digit in the second quarter to double digits in the third quarter. Average selling prices on both a reported and mix-adjusted basis increased over 12% from the prior year's third quarter. Current pricing momentum and the visibility into future public demand growth will support a positive pricing environment for the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. As expected, our costs remained elevated in the quarter due to continued inflationary pressures. The price per gallon of diesel was more than 60% higher than the prior year, and most parts and supplies also face significant inflationary increases. Our focus on driving efficiencies through the Vulcan way of operating is critical to continuing with inflationary pressures and continuing to expand our unit profitability. In the third quarter, aggregates cash gross profit per ton improved 9% to $8.41 per ton. Our Asphalt segment also achieved significant improvement in the third quarter with a $22 million year-over-year increase in cash gross profit. The average price of liquid asphalt increased by over $200 per ton compared to the prior year's third quarter. That said, continued pricing momentum and healthy volumes drove favorable results in spite of the ongoing energy-related cost pressures. Asphalt volumes increased 13% and asphalt pricing improved 26%. Both volume and pricing improvements were widespread with particular strength in Arizona and California, our two largest asphalt markets. Concrete cash gross profit in the third quarter improved $25 million due to the contribution from acquired operations as well as strong volume and price growth in our legacy operations. Now that we have briefly reviewed the results from the third quarter, let's shift to the underlying demand environment and the outlook for construction activity. We see both challenges and opportunities in the future demand environment with different dynamics impacting each end use. Single-family housing is facing considerable headwinds, but multifamily housing and private non-residential starts still show growth. On the public side, leading indicators for highways and other infrastructure are reflecting strong tax revenues and increased funding from the infrastructure investment and Jobs Act. I'll share a few highlights on each end use. Starting with residential, single-family demand is now showing the impact of rising construction inflation, home prices and mortgage rates. Permits and starts are declining albeit at slower rates in bulk-and-serve markets than the country as a whole. Multifamily permits and starts remain positive. It's important to remember that residential construction activity remains at high levels. Also, household formations and limited inventories may dampen the magnitude and duration of weakness in residential demand. Private non-residential demand and leading indicators are currently healthy and the trailing 12-month private non-residential starts are up 21% over the prior year. Additionally, leading indicators remain positive with the Architecture Billings Index, or ABI still greater than 50 and the Dodge Momentum Index at high levels. On the public side, we are in growth mode. Trailing 12-month highway starts are up 14% and other infrastructure starts are up 18%. In fact, July and August were the two largest single months for highway awards in the last 10 years. The timing of starts converting to aggregate shipments will be a critical variable impacting next year's demand for aggregates. As we look into 2023, we expect that the current strength in private non-residential construction activity and increased public funding will help to offset contracting residential demand. We also carry strong pricing momentum into 2023. Our teams will be finalizing their annual planning over the next few weeks and we will share with you our full-year outlook on 2023 in February. Even with uncertainty in the broader economy, we are confident that we are well positioned to capitalize on pricing opportunities, benefit from the generational increases in public funding, and continue to expand our unit profitability. I will now turn the call over to Mary Andrews to comment further on our results and full-year outlook. Mary Andrews? Mary Carlisle : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Tom highlighted the strong operating results we achieved in the third quarter in both our Aggregates and Non-aggregates segments. So I'll focus on a few other items in the P&L, the balance sheet and our revised outlook for the full-year 2022. Our SAG expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 30 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 6.5% of revenue. Year-over-year increases in SAG were driven primarily by higher incentives consistent with improved earnings and elevated legal and professional fees related both to Mexico and business development activities. Our support teams have been focused on integration activities for acquired businesses, and we expect to reap benefits from those activities into next year. During the quarter, we recognized a pretax gain of $24 million on the sale of real estate in California. Also, as part of our ongoing focus on portfolio management, we are finalizing an agreement for the disposition of our ready-mix asset in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. And therefore, during the quarter, we adjusted the carrying value to fair value, resulting in a $68 million pretax charge. Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, our net leverage was 2.5x adjusted EBITDA and within our stated target range of 2x to 2.5x. Disciplined capital management remains fundamental to our strategy and we will continue to deploy capital consistent with our longstanding stated priority. Through the first nine months of this year, we've deployed $378 million in operating and growth capital to support and expand our valuable franchise, $528 million in M&A to grow and strengthen our market positions and $159 million in dividends to return cash to shareholders. Our balance sheet is strong. And during the quarter, we added another source of flexible and cost-effective capital by initiating a commercial paper program. We issued $550 million of commercial paper and used the proceeds to repay half of the outstanding $1.1 billion term loan. In conjunction with initiating the commercial paper program, we also upsized our revolving credit facility to $1.6 billion and extended its maturity to August of 2027. Our investment-grade balance sheet and significant cash generation capabilities give us the capacity to continue to invest in both organic and inorganic opportunities with a focus on improving shareholder returns and return on invested capital. On a trailing 12-month basis, our return on invested capital at quarter end was 13.6% inclusive of strategic acquisitions and ongoing investments and growth opportunities. We are focused on continuing to improve our returns. Now let me comment on the update to our full-year 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance. We now expect to generate between $1.64 billion and $1.68 billion. Continued strength and underlying demand and acquisition activity are driving aggregates shipment expectations above the upper end of our original expectations of 5% to 7%. We now expect full-year aggregates volume to improve between 7% and 8%. We continue to expect mid single-digit growth and aggregates cash gross profit per ton for the full-year. As expected, pricing gains continue to grow in the third quarter and year-over-year improvement and unit profitability expanded sequentially and was in line with our second half expectations. Other updates to our guidance include full-year SAG expenses of approximately $520 million. Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion expenses of approximately $575 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. We continue to expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million on capital expenditures in 2022. These expenditures include both maintenance and growth projects, and the higher fourth quarter pace of expenditures is reflective of expected deliveries on ordered equipment. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks. Thomas Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews. Before we go to Q&A, I want to thank our entire Vulcan team for their hard work and consistent execution. I'm proud of the results they delivered in the third quarter, and I'm excited about the operations we added through acquisitions in the quarter. I'm particularly proud of the Vulcan family members who helped to rebuild Sanibel Causeway while at the same time coping with the hurricane impacts on their lives. Thank all of you for your dedication, to your community and to one another. We are always focused on keeping our people safe. We will continue empowering and developing our talented people and executing at a local level. We'll take advantage of the positive momentum and be nimble in addressing new challenges. I'm confident in our ability to continue driving improvement in our core business through the further development of our Vulcan way of selling and Vulcan way of operating strategic disciplines. They allow us to both take advantage of opportunities and confront challenges. Vulcan's long-term growth and value are durable because we have the right people focused on the right disciplines, offering the right products in the right markets. And now, Mary Andrews and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. Could you guys talk about \u2013 I mean, you had some momentum kind of exiting the year. Kind of how does this position you all kind of thinking about into next year, whether \u2013 I mean you mentioned a little bit on the \u2013 some of the end market side, but just curious to get your thoughts, high level? Thomas Hill : Yes. Good morning, first of all. And I think I'll take the fourth quarter first and then next year. If you look at the numbers in the fourth quarter, it would really show flat volumes compared to last year. And that's really not a reflection on demand. It's more about comps and fourth quarter weather. So we tried to be thoughtful about this. Last year's November, December shipping rates were the highest in 10 years. In fact, November was the highest month of last year. And then you always got weather in the fourth quarter. In fact, we've seen some of that already. The hurricane that hit Florida actually impacted us the first week of the fourth quarter when it blew up through the East Coast with a lot of rain. And then we've been impacted with low water on the Mississippi. If you step back and look at the fundamentals, our leading indicators are still very positive. Bookings and backlogs are up meaningful year-over-year and quote activity is still robust. So I think we're just trying to weigh puts and takes in the fourth quarter. Looking to 2023, we're actually doing those budgets right now as we speak and appreciate our operators' hard work on that. At a high level, I think 2023 will depend on the magnitude of decline in single-family residential construction, that being offset by the timing and growth of infrastructure and private non-res construction. If you look at the leading indicators in private non-res and in public infrastructure, they're very positive, particularly in Vulcan markets. The starts in Vulcan markets are outpacing other markets. The non-residential indicators, the ABI and the DMI, they both point to growth. On highways IIJA, we're seeing \u2013 we're starting to see that impact on DOT planning. It's really a question of the timing from starts to shipments. Quote activity in both non-res and highways is very good and customer sentiment is positive, and you've got to believe the fundamental of construction employment growth. So I think for next year, it's a matter of positives in non-res and highways being offset by single-family. What I do know about 2023, I think that I have confidence that we'll be able to grow our unit margins. And what gives me confidence in that is the hard work that we talked about at Investor Day, we were like done and that we're doing on our strategic disciplines, the Vulcan way of selling, the Vulcan way of operations. And I think we've proved that we could do that. And even with significant headwinds, we were consistent in growing unit margins at a pandemic. We were consistent in growing unit margins when we saw volumes fall. And we've been pretty consistent about growing them even in the face of dramatic inflationary pressures. So I'm confident we'll improve regardless \u2013 improve unit margins in 2023, regardless of outside forces, and that's because we just want to control our own destiny. Stanley Elliott : Tom, that\u2019s great color. Thanks very much and best of luck. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Trey. Mary Carlisle : Good morning. Trey Grooms : Hey. Good morning, Tom, Mary Andrews. Thank you for taking my question. Tom, you touched on this on the prior question answer, but if we could get more color. You guys put up impressive improvement in aggregates unit margins. I know you spend a lot of time on the Analyst Day talking about that, and we saw that come through in the quarter, especially given the cost headwinds. But could you talk about maybe in a little bit more detail how we should be thinking about the puts and takes as we look into the 4Q and into 2023 on the cash gross profit per ton improvement? I know you mentioned the confidence there and growing, but any further color would be great. Thomas Hill : Sure. I think as I look at the fourth quarter, much like the third quarter, I think we'll continue that momentum. And I think I would look at it pretty much consistent with Q3. Again, we carry good pricing momentum into 2023, and we'll get into that in more detail, but work to be done there. It's not \u2013 we don't have that in the bag yet. And then from a operating efficiencies, you saw that when we talked about that in September. It's really more throughput, less downtime and being efficient with your labor and your inspections on your equipment to catch it before it breaks. And I think those disciplines are in place. We're improving. We've got the automation in place now. Still work to be done on it, but it's about consistent, continuous improvement. Trey Grooms : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much for the color. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Can we just talk about the really strong acceleration in your aggregates organic volumes and margin improvement within the context of the headwinds that you're facing from the Mexican operations? What extent have you been able to hit the same markets from rail lines versus the prior transportation method? And can you just bridge for us the year-over-year margin improvement given the drag having those operations down year-over-year had in the quarter? Thanks. Thomas Hill : Yes. I think if you just step back and look at Mexico, nothing's changed there. We'll still shut down. The impact is still going to be that $80 million to $100 million for the full-year, and that's built into our guidance. If you look at volumes, the volume growth was really widespread. It's not \u2013 it's in every market we had. And so it was very widespread. We were \u2013 have not been able to make up the volumes on the coast and \u2013 just because the railroads can't \u2013 we can't mitigate it with \u2013 because the railroads can't pull the volume. In fact, they couldn't pull the volume we wanted to ship prior to Mexico being shut down. So that has just been a loss for us and one that you've seen us made up kind of throughout our markets. Jerry Revich : And Tom, can you comment on the margin piece because that $80 million to $100 million run rate, that's a big headwind that you folks overcame in the quarter. Any additional context you can provide? Thomas Hill : Yes. I mean, it's just a matter of those strategic disciplines at work. You've got price up 12.5%, and you've got \u2013 our operating efficiencies are in place and working and continue to improve. We're at $8.41 per ton in the third quarter. So we're barreling towards that $9. This is why we placed another target of 11 to 12, but I think it's just fundamental solid operations and execution. Jerry Revich : Well done. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Philip Ng from Jefferies. Philip Ng : Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter and a really good execution across the board. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Mary Carlisle : Thanks, Phil. Philip Ng : Tom, I guess, you gave us some qualitative color on how to think about 2023. One of your competitors guide to be flat volumes for next year. I know you guys are still kind of working through that. But can you kind of help unpack how you're thinking about some of these end markets where it's housing, non-res and infrastructure. Are some of the good guys enough to offset that? And on the DOT side, what do you start anticipating that inflection kind of pop? Just wanted to get some color in terms of the cadence and that flow through next year? Thomas Hill : I think you asked the right question about when does a highways pop. If you look at starts and highways on a trailing six-month basis, it's up 17% on a three-month basis, it's up 27%. So the fundamentals for multiyear growth in highways and infrastructure are very good. You've got substantial funding, both state, county city. You add to that the COVID funds. For example, highways funding went up in Florida, $1.5 billion from COVID funds. So there's substantial funding everywhere and you're starting to see that flow into lettings. In fact, we booked substantial highway work in the last 90 days. So biddings and bookings growth should continue through the fourth quarter and through 2023 and probably for another five or six years. At this point, it's not if, but when. It's a matter of timing. And the speed to get funding to lettings, which you're starting to see, lettings to aggregate shipments. Admittedly, the DOTs have struggled \u2013 continue to struggle a little bit to get money out, but they're obviously making progress with those trailing three-month starts at the 27%. And for example, Caltrans, the 2021, 2022 lettings were target was $4.9 billion. They fell short by $500 million when they shifted into 2023 plans, which is now $5.4 billion and the next year is $7.2 billion. So highways is growing. I think it's just \u2013 it's really just a matter of speed and how fast they can get to work. I think, again, what I'm encouraged that is \u2013 last 90 days at 27% improvements on starts. That's a big deal, and we're seeing in lettings. And you can see that start to flow as people are making plans for calendar year 2023. On non-res, it's remarkably strong and growing and starts are way up, and it's widespread. Philip Ng : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Thomas Hill : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl : Thanks for taking my questions. Can we talk about inflation a little bit and maybe give us a little more color on how you're seeing that evolve into the fourth quarter, where you've seen an easing if you have seen easing? And conversely, if there are any incremental pressures you're seeing? Any thoughts on if things stay the way they are, what that means for carryover inflation into the beginning of next year? Thomas Hill : Yes. I would call the fourth quarter similar to third quarter. The cost inflation just remains stubbornly high. We're obviously offsetting that with price and operating efficiencies or some of it. The parts and service costs are and will probably stay high. I would think that will be for sure in the fourth quarter, and I would expect it into 2023. Obviously, energy headwinds have been \u2013 particularly diesel has been extremely tough year-to-date. That's just under $100 million headwind for us. So I think we should expect most of the cost inflation to remain elevated for sure in the fourth quarter, and I would expect it into 2023. Michael Dahl : Okay. That helps. Thanks. And my second question is just on the sale of the ready-mix assets in the tri-state area and Pennsylvania. Can you just walk us through that a little bit more kind of rationale and any comments on as you've evaluated the portfolio post the U.S. Concrete deal? Is this kind of the last chunky thing? Or are there other things potentially on the horizon? Thomas Hill : When we bought this, we said we would value \u2013 we take a year to evaluate and look at our hand. And us selling the ready-mix business is \u2013 well, we're selling the ready-mix business up there. We're keeping the aggregate business. And this is us just optimizing our portfolio. We felt like that after looking at it, the ready-mix business up there fit others better than it did us. We had plenty of suitors. Again, we like the aggregates business. That's a good infrastructure play. It's a well-structured aggregate market, which we think is a platform for growth. And all you're seeing there is us optimizing our portfolio. Michael Dahl : Got it. Okay, thank you. Thomas Hill : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Michael Feniger : Good morning, Tom. Thanks for taking my questions. Obviously, the concern on demand has been around housing and implications there. So Tom, I believe your shipments peaked last cycle in 2005 with housing, yet you were able to really grow strongly in 2006 and 2007. I believe since you are still kind of flat to down in that period. So could we see a similar playbook here for 2023, 2024, with housing down, the resi down yet infrastructure is strong and pricing. Maybe kind of just talk through the similarities from what we're seeing now compared to that 2005 period when housing started to turn. Thomas Hill : Yes. Housing has turned. We know that. I think that the starts point to it, as do permits. I think what you got to step back and remember, what's very different this time is it's \u2013 the fundamentals for single-family residential growth in our market still \u2013 they're still there. You've got extremely low inventories, you've got good employment and you've got population growth. So the underlying fundamentals were not overbuilt like we were \u2013 when housing went down the last time. So I would expect it to have less depth and less length of time. That being said, I think what really is different for me is the non-res side. It is very strong. All end uses are up, that's office in stores, warehouses, manufacturing, industrial and institutional and the leading indicators show growth. For example, if you look at square footage, which is how we have to look at it, trailing 12-month starts are up 29% in our markets versus 11% in others and trailing three-month is up 47% in our markets versus 9% in non-Vulcan market. So again, it's widespread. It's across all end users. And what stands out for me also is the manufacturing growth in the Southeast, and these are big jobs that we've built on. And let's see if I can just take a few of those. You've got, for example, Big River Steel in Arkansas, it's probably 0.5 million tons. You've got Universal Epic Park in Orlando, Smith Farms, Industrial Park in South Carolina. The big Ford electric vehicle center in Tennessee and the Samsung chip plant in Texas. And the list keeps going. So I guess, a little bit surprised, but very pleased with the rate of growth we're seeing in non-res. Mary Carlisle : Yes. And I think one other thing as we think about kind of 2005 era versus now more internally. I think we're in a different place with the focus that we've put on our strategic disciplines and the Vulcan way of selling and the Vulcan way of operating, which we're confident will be helpful regardless of the macro environment. Michael Feniger : Helpful. Thank you. And just my second question, on the aggregate side, you reported an incremental margin of 21%, 31% ex-freight. Just bigger picture, I know we're not guiding here, but if we turn to next year and you're getting double-digit growth, which is all price or price-led, you don't have another $100 million headwind from energy, let's say, you don't have a headwind there. What's the right incremental operating margin, which you could kind of expect on that aggregate side if we don't have that cost or inflationary headwind? Thank you. Mary Carlisle : Yes. On the incrementals, as we always do, we'll guide you back to over the long-term and on a same-store basis to that kind of 60%. Obviously, the dynamics in these volatile inflationary times make those numbers jump all over the place. But we always take you back to that 60% over the long-term. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how much pricing you expect to carry over into 2023 from some of the mid-year actions you took this year in aggregates and just how to think about pricing broadly moving forward, given some of the demand uncertainty? And if you could maybe give us some color on how the discussions are going around early next year price increases at this point, that would be helpful. Thomas Hill : Sure. The pricing environment continues to be very good and really driven by visibility to growth in infrastructure and inflation. As we said last quarter, we saw \u2013 we're going to see prices sequentially grow. We saw it grow from Q1 to Q2, and then it really jumped from Q2 to Q3 I would say Q4 similar to Q3. And that growth has really supported the big jump from two to three by the July price increases and higher price bid work. And that pricing is widespread across all of our markets. And importantly, we're able to take it to the bottom line through the Vulcan way of selling and Vulcan way of ops. If you look at next year, we carry a lot of that momentum into 2023 as do our ready-mix asphalt and contractor customers. The work we're bidding now will ship in 2023. So we're setting the table right now. And we've had our \u2013 we're having our January pricing conversations for fixed plants, and I think those have gone well. But remember, work to be done. The second half comps are going to be a lot tougher. And so while we got good momentum and have a good start to 2023, we still got to be worked \u2013 we still have to do work to earn that price, particularly in the second half. Garik Shmois : Got it. Thanks for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Thompson : Thank you for taking my question today. You've been spending time cleaning up portfolio with the assets in the Northeast. But as we look forward, you've also mentioned focusing on M&A and growth particularly in a market that is a bit uncertain right now. How do you focus on \u2013 how where do you focus on growing your portfolio in light of the current dynamic? Thank you. Thomas Hill : Yes. I mean you saw us do some of that this year. We bought some very strategic assets in Northern California and coastal Texas that fit us well and fit our network and expanded our network. I think that as we look at acquisitions, you probably see a little bit \u2013 maybe a little bit of slowing, which usually happens in times of uncertainty. And I think our position here is to be opportunistic and disciplined as always, particularly what markets you want to be in. To your point, you got to be very disciplined about what markets you want to be in, and what you don't and what product lines you want to be in in those markets. So we'll continue that. I think this was a typical year with a number of strategic aggregate bolt-ons, and I think you'll continue to see us do that. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Mary Carlisle : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : Over the past year, we've heard about tight cement and RMC markets being a bottleneck for ag volumes. As the housing market has softened, have you seen that start to loosen? Or is that something that you anticipate to see in 2023? Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about those downstream markets. Thomas Hill : Yes, it has been tight. I mean maybe a little bit of a headwind on aggregates. I'm not sure drivers and trucks wouldn't have been a headwind anyway with that. We've really not seen a lot of the housing market tighten in our markets yet, maybe a little bit in Northern California and North Texas, but really, we've not seen it yet. With leading indicators, we know it's going to come. I would expect most markets to continue to be somewhat tight on cement even with the loosening of residential starts. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Good morning. Adam Thalhimer : I wanted to zero in on the Northeast concrete sale. What was the impact to that in terms of Q3 gross profit? Because I guess you put that into assets held for sale. So you took that out of the Concrete segment before Q3. And then what would be the total impact to the back half of the year vis-\u00e0-vis taking that out versus your guidance? Mary Carlisle : Yes. Adam, you're right, we did reclassified the assets. That's held for sale on the balance sheet. We continue \u2013 those operations are still reflected in the P&L in continuing ops. And in terms of the rest of the year, we've taken that into account in the updated guidance that we provided. And once it closes, we can comment more on the details of that transaction. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. But for Q3, Northeast is in the concrete gross profit numbers? Mary Carlisle : That's correct. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. Thank you very much. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Mary Carlisle : Good morning. Timna Tanners : Just wanted to follow-up, and I know this is tricky, but on the Mexican quarry, if you were in our shoes, how would you think about, one, the timing of any restart or ability to restart? And two, any compensation for lost revenue? Any updated thoughts there or any progress would be great? Thanks. Thomas Hill : I wouldn't count on a restart. I would count on that the $80 million to $100 million is built into our guidance. It's the volumes and our volumes and has all the earnings. We filed an application with the NAFTA arbitration to seek additional claims because of the closure. And in July, we were very pleased the Tribunal granted our application to seek further claims. We're pleased with that decision. We hope to know a lot more in 2023, but these things take time. We've not made the claim public, mainly because we're still working on the magnitude of the ancillary claims. So work to be done on that one, but we do feel like we'll be compensated. We do feel like we have a good case, and we felt like the Tribunal recognize that with letting us open that back up in July. Timna Tanners : Okay. Any things to watch for, like any upcoming court dates or time frames to watch for that could be further progress? Thomas Hill : It will be next year. And again, it takes time. I would say \u2013 well, as things come \u2013 as we know, we'll let you know, but no hard dates at this point. Timna Tanners : Okay. Appreciate the update. Thanks. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dillon Cumming from Morgan Stanley. Dillon Cumming : Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Sorry to ask another one on Mexico, but just you kind of noted in your release that you had acquired a quarry in Honduras, I believe, which I think was serving some of those same Gulf Coast markets. Just kind of wanted to ask if there were any kind of like less obvious ways, South America and otherwise that you might be able to actually fill in those volumes that we should be watching for into next year as well? Thomas Hill : No. I mean that was a business we had already been associated with it. We had a distribution agreement in place for that quarry for four years. So we've been selling those materials as a complementary product to our blue water network since 2019. So it's not added to volume. It will be \u2013 its lower mark substantially lower large margins than Mexico. We've gotten the question, well, can you expand it? And it would be logistically really difficult considerably increase the volumes from where they are today because of where that quarry is and some of the shipping constraints. It was \u2013 we had it in business for the last few years, really is a complementary source to supply those coastal markets. So it's really not a replacement for tons in Mexico or profitability in Mexico. Dillon Cumming : Great. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Hughes from Truist. Keith Hughes : Thank you. Just within the fourth quarter kind of implied guide, do you think in the aggregate segment, will you be able to grow margins, in other words, get kind of ahead of the cost curve? Is there still going to be a drag? Thomas Hill : On the fourth quarter, I would expect a very similar performance to what you saw in Q3. So we've gotten our price out ahead of cost. Where I don't expect cost to \u2013 the inflationary pressures to go down, either in Q4 or 2023. So that's kind of how I look at. Mary Andrews? Mary Carlisle : Yes. And Keith, I think on a gross margin basis, kind of what we discussed at the second quarter was we expected in the back half that the margins would squeeze closer to the prior year. You saw that in the third quarter. The delta was about half of what it was in the second quarter, and I think that, that will continue to improve in the fourth quarter. Keith Hughes : Okay. You had a really nice improvement in concrete and the third, would we expect a similar type of improvement in the fourth? Thomas Hill : I think I would expect a similar performance in the quarter. I'd expect it to start going up again in the first quarter of next year as we have price increases in the first year in concrete. Keith Hughes : All right. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Mary Carlisle : Good morning. Tyler Brown : Hey, Mary Andrews. I know it's a bit early, but I want to start thinking about the building blocks on the free cash flow side for next year. I think that bonus depreciation actually steps down in 2023. That may put some pressure on cash taxes. I think cash interest is probably a headwind. But just any color on those two items specifically and the magnitude and what that might mean for free cash? Mary Carlisle : We'll give \u2013 obviously give more guidance on that when we get to February. I think you're thinking about the interest components correctly. Our conversion ratios have remained at really, really healthy levels, and I don't think we'd expect that to change materially in 2023. Tyler Brown : Okay. All right. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Mary Carlisle : Good morning. David MacGregor : Good morning. Great quarter. Congratulations on the results. Thomas Hill : Thank you. David MacGregor : I wanted to ask you about the revised shipment guidance, and going from 5% to 7% up to 7% to 8%. And how much of this would you relate to improving demand versus maybe easing constraints? And I guess with respect to some of those constraints, are they evolving in a favorable way is economic growth eases in this country and will 2023 be any different? Thomas Hill : Yes. I think you've seen a little bit of easing and constraints in construction, but they're still substantial. The railroad constraints we're still \u2013 while they've improved a little bit. We still got bottlenecks. On a good shipping day, you still have trucking constraints, albeit both of them are a little bit better than maybe they were a year ago. Same thing with builders. They're still having problems getting supplies and getting parts to get them in a timely manner and they're holding up construction, again, maybe a little better. We said at the beginning of the year that the underlying demand was better than what we had predicted and we continue to see that underlying demand to be pretty good, albeit starting to see some softness in leading indicators in single-family. I think it's a combination of demand remains very good and some easing of bottlenecks, although they're still there. David MacGregor : And thoughts with respect to whether it gets any better in 2023? Thomas Hill : Yes. I think it continues to improve. I think it's slow. I think the railroads are adding people. Obviously, we're getting more efficient with our trucking to the Vulcan way of selling. And I think in supplies for construction, I think, continue to slowly improve as we go through 2023. Mary Carlisle : Yes. And another impact on the full-year volume guide was the acquisition activity and just the healthy underlying demand held up. David MacGregor : Got it. Thank you very much. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Thomas Hill : Hi, Mike. Mary Carlisle : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Thanks for getting me in. Good morning, Mark, Tom and Mary Andrews. Maybe to follow-up on the previous questions back on free cash. As you're looking at your plans for 2023, not to put out the exact guidance, but relative to CapEx spending levels next year versus this year, are you caught up from some of the delays from the pandemic relative to some of the maintenance or growth opportunities? And since you implied that potentially because of the uncertainty and acquisitions maybe a little bit more tricky or maybe deferred, how does that impact relative to allocation towards the balance sheet or capital return to shareholders? Thank you. Mary Carlisle : So I think on CapEx, like our operating plans, we're in the middle of finalizing our 2023 needs right now. I don't think I would expect anything substantially different. We have hopefully been able to catch up some of the lack of spending in 2020 and 2021. You'll note that our pace of spending in Q4 will accelerate from what it has been, and that's dependent upon receiving equipment. So we'll just kind of see how that shakes out and that will somewhat impact 2023 as well. But over the longer term, I think about CapEx as the \u2013 vary with volume more than anything else, more and more than time. And so we wouldn't see anything meaningfully different. Operator : And that appears to be our last question. I will now turn the program back to management for any additional or closing remarks. Thomas Hill : Thank you. I want to take a minute and thank the entire Vulcan team for their tireless efforts to ensure continuous improvement regardless of what the world throws at them. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials, and we look forward to talking to you through the quarter. Thank you, and have a safe day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Gretchen, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Mary Andrews Carlisle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks along with other legal disclaimers are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation, and other SEC filings. In the interest of time, please limit your Q&A participation to one question. This will allow for more questions during our time together. A supplemental presentation has been posted to our website, vulcanmaterials.com. Additionally, a recording of this call will be available for replay, later today, at our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks to all of you for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. In 2022, our teams hands down excelled in confronting macro challenges, and they demonstrated the resiliency of our aggregates-led business. Let's start with the fourth quarter, which really showcased our commitment to controlling what we can control. We generated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, and I was particularly proud of our team for delivering 11% year-over-year growth in aggregates cash gross profit per ton despite a 6% decline in aggregates shipments. Abnormally wet and cold weather across our footprint disrupted construction activity and shipments across all segments, and we also began feeling the impact of single-family residential decline. Pricing momentum continued with 15% growth in aggregates mix adjusted price in the fourth quarter. Our people continue to drive performance through good execution, which is grounded in our Vulcan way of selling and the Vulcan way of operating disciplines. Gross profit in both aggregates and asphalt segments increased versus the prior year's fourth quarter despite lower volumes, and pricing momentum, more than offset inflationary cost increases. In concrete, a 15% decline in volume, driven mostly by extremely wet and cold weather in Texas created operational challenges that eroded pricing gains in that segment. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA improved 12% with all segments posting year-over-year growth in gross profit. Aggregates segment gross profit improved 9%, a noteworthy performance with the headwinds of generationally high inflation and the unexpected and arbitrary shutdown of our valuable Mexico operations in May of 2022. Aggregates volume increased 6% and average selling prices improved 10%, accelerating as the year progressed. Importantly, our aggregates cash gross profit per ton improved over 5%, and also accelerated throughout the year, even in a challenging operating environment. In the first quarter, we held our own while inflation ramped up, more steadily than expected. Then in the second quarter, cash gross profit per ton grew modestly versus the second quarter of 2021, as we responded quickly with additional pricing action. In the third quarter, cash gross profit per ton increased 9% as pricing momentum accelerated and operating efficiencies offset some of the inflationary pressures. And as I mentioned earlier in the fourth quarter, cash gross profit per ton improved a notable 11%, even as volumes declined. In our asphalt segment, the second half of 2022 marked an inflection point on price and cost dynamics. In the third quarter, robust pricing improvement began outpacing the sharply-rising liquid asphalt costs. For the full year, pricing increased by 21% to more than offset the 36% increase in liquid asphalt costs. And volumes grew by 7% with particular strength in Arizona and California, our two largest asphalt markets. Ultimately, gross profit improved to $57 million versus the prior year's $21 million. In the Concrete segment, full-year gross profit of $89 million increased 64% compared to the prior year due to a full year's contribution from the U.S. concrete assets, in addition to improved earnings in our legacy Northern Virginia and Northern California Concrete Businesses. Inflationary pressures, including diesel and the availability of both cement and drivers had a significant impact on performance in the Concrete segment. Now, let's shift to the new year, first focusing on demand. The demand environment for 2023 is mixed, both in terms of end users and timing. We expect modest growth in overall public demand but contraction in private demand. Now, I'll comment briefly on each end-use. Residential construction activity is showing the impact of rising construction costs, home prices and mortgage rates on single-family housing. Single-family starts and permits have continued to decline but to a lesser degree in Vulcan-served states and the country as a whole. Currently, multifamily remains positive with a strong pipeline of projects under construction. Housing will certainly be the primary drag on private construction in 2023, but we expect it to quickly return to growth. It is important to remember that the demographics and employment growth in our markets continue to support household formation and the growing need for additional houses in the future. Overall, private nonresidential demand remains at healthy levels. Manufacturing and other heavy industrial projects continue to provide opportunities, but we are monitoring leading indicators such as more recent ABI measures, moderation in the Dodge Momentum Index, and survey data indicating declining loan demand and lending tightening. On the public side, we expect positive momentum throughout 2023 and beyond as states and municipalities move forward with much-needed infrastructure investment. Highway and infrastructure starts are both positive. In highways, start strengthened significantly in the second half of 2022, growing at 25% on a trailing 12-month basis at the end of the year. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding is now reflected in proposed state fiscal year 2023, 2024 budgets across our footprint. The multiyear outlook for public infrastructure is solid. We continue to believe that the increased funding will began impacting aggregates shipments modestly as we move through 2023 and more meaningfully in 2024. In addition to IIJA funding, state tax receipts in Vulcan states are the highest they've been in the past 10 years. Strong state and municipal revenue support non-highway infrastructure investment as public entities continue to play catch up from the last decade of housing growth that has driven a fundamental need for infrastructure investment. Also the considerable funding from IIJA for investment in water, energy, ports, and airports will provide future demand growth. Overall 2023 demand for aggregates will be dependent upon the depth and the duration of the declines in residential construction activity, the impact of rising interest rates on private nonresidential construction activity as the year progresses, and the timing of highway starts converting to aggregates demand. Considering these dynamics, we currently expect our aggregate shipments to decline between 2%and 6% in 2023. Pricing momentum and operational execution will drive our 2023 performance. We expect aggregate pricing to increase between 11% and 13%. Most importantly, we will continue to improve our industry-leading aggregates cash gross profit per ton and deliver solid earnings growth in 2023. Now, I will turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our 2022 performance and some more details around our 2023 guidance. Mary Andrews? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Our 2022 operating performance led to another year of solid cash generation and disciplined capital allocation. Over the last four years, our free cash flow conversion has averaged over 90% with a 93% conversion ratio for 2022. After investing over $600 million in capital expenditures for both maintenance and growth projects, we put additional capital to work by completing $529 million in bolt-on acquisitions and also returned $213 million to shareholders via our growing and importantly sustainable dividend. During 2022, we also reduced our leverage back to within our stated target range of 2 times to 2.5 times after completing the U.S. Concrete acquisition in August of 2021. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.3 times at year-end. Our investment-grade balance sheet and significant cash-generation capability give us the capacity to continue to invest in both organic and inorganic opportunities with a constant focus on improving shareholder returns and return on invested capital as we grow and optimize our portfolio. During the fourth quarter, we completed the previously-announced sale of our ready-mix assets in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. On a trailing 12-month basis, our return on invested capital at year-end was 13.5%, inclusive of the loss of earnings historically generated from the network of assets supporting our shutdown of Mexico operations. We also remain focused on continuing to leverage our SAG cost base. SAG expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 50 basis points versus the prior year to 7% of revenues. Having strategically managed our balance sheet, our portfolio, and our overhead cost structure, we entered 2023 from a position of strength. Tom shared with you our views on the macro demand environment and resulting aggregates expectations. Even with the challenging and uncertain macro backdrop, we expect to grow our adjusted EBITDA to between $1.725 billion and $1.875 billion by capitalizing on the strengths of our aggregates-led business and executing on our foundational strategic discipline. In our downstream businesses, we expect total cash gross profit dollars to approximate 2022 levels. Continued improvement in asphalt segment profitability and the benefit of improving highway demand should offset both the impact of the 2022 divestiture of our concrete businesses in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and the impact of slowing residential construction activity on our remaining concrete businesses. We expect SAG expenses of between $515 million and $530 million as we remain focused on driving efficiencies in our support functions while delivering new capabilities for the business through investments in technology and talent. We also expect depreciation, depletion, and amortization, and accretion expenses of approximately $610 million; interest expense of approximately $195 million; and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. In 2023, we plan to consistently reinvest in our franchise with $600 million to $650 million of capital expenditures for both maintenance and growth projects. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks. Thomas Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews. Before we move to Q&A, I want to thank our entire Vulcan team for a successful year in 2022. And I have great confidence in our ability to continue to execute in 2023, even with the uncertainty in the macro environment. As always, we will be keenly focused on keeping our people safe, driving value for our customers, and capitalizing on the profitability expansion opportunities supported by the Vulcan way of selling and the Vulcan way of operating disciplines. Vulcan is uniquely positioned to create long-term sustainable value with the right products, in the right markets, with the right focus from the right people. And now, Mary Andrews and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Mark Warren : Good morning, Stanley. Stanley Elliott : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning and thank you all for the question. I guess my question would be. I guess coming in, maybe we would have thought maybe more flattish volumes in '23 or maybe even modest volume growth. What changed, if anything, resulting in a 2% to 6% kind of volume outlook decline now? And is there anything you could share with us about what you're seeing, and maybe a little more in-depth across those end markets? Thank you. Thomas Hill : Yes. Sure. If you -- looking into '23, we saw some pretty good bounce-back in January from the bad weather we've had in the fourth quarter. So solid shipments, that being said, with the exception of California, which everybody knows we had floods. But the markets look pretty good. The -- if you look at the leading indicators this year, maybe not as clear as they usually are, so we tried to be thoughtful as we looked at demand throughout the year. And I think a lot of it boils down to timing. When do we see the decrease in single-family really get to shipments? You probably saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, but I think the full impact gets us, we realize that kind of end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter. So single-family probably gets hit about down 20%. And then for non-res, it's really again about timing with -- while the leading indicators for non-res look pretty good starts. Longer-term indicators of commercial loans and ABI could lead to challenges in the second half of the year. So we would call that segment flat for 2023. And then it's always timing for highway funding and lettings doing the shipments will be critical. We think that segment -- the public segment is up low-single digits. So as we step back and look at this, we tried to be thoughtful about the dynamics that impact the shipments and the timing of that demand. And while we can't control demand, we can control how we run our business and our unit margins. And I think we've proven we're very good at that. We think we'll grow that mid-teens. So regardless of the dynamics affecting, shipments will grow our earnings. Stanley Elliott : Great, guys. And nice work on the profitability improvement. And thanks. That's it from me. Thanks a lot. Mark Warren : Thank you. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens Inc. Trey Grooms : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Trey. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Trey Grooms : Hi. So yes, I want to echo good work on the profitability. And it looks like on the guide, it implies an acceleration there on that improvement on cash gross profit per unit. And I guess the moving pieces there if you could maybe cut into those a little bit. We've got -- pricing is obviously playing a role. And as we kind of look at the cadence there through the year, maybe you could talk about that as well with maybe what's baked in with a midyear increase? And how we think about the cadence of that profitability improvement as we look through the year? Thomas Hill : I would call it pretty consistent. We carry really good pricing momentum into 2023. As we said, we guide 11% to 13% for '23. I'm really pleased with our team's performance and how they service our customers to earn that price and how they face the challenges that we've seen over the last three years and then they can adjust price on the fly and very quickly. Our pricing discussions for January 1, I thought went very well, and they're in place. And you got to remember that as we progressed through last year, pricing accelerated as we went through 2022 driven by inflation. So the comps in the second half on price get harder so -- but I think we're confident in that -- while we're confident in that, there's still work to be done in pricing and earning that from our customers. Importantly, as you talked about, our teams have been able to take price to the bottom line, and we think we do that mid-teens this year. I would call price, while pricing comps get tougher as we progress through the year, cost comps get easier. So I would expect a pretty steady growth in that mid-teen level of unit margin growth quarter after quarter. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And Trey, we do expect solid unit profitability growth throughout the year. And of course, we don't give quarterly guidance. But I will try to give you some additional and hopefully helpful context, may be more related to volume. And if you think in terms of cadence, we definitely will have tougher seasonal comps in the first half. Looking back at 2022, three of the six months in the first half of 2022 implied 12-month shipments at a higher level than our full year 2022, and only one of six months in the back half shows particularly seasonally strong shipments. And of course, Q4 with the weather impact. We'll provide an easier comp in 2023. So all in, I think, more challenging year-over-year in the first half from a volume perspective, and the comps at least moderate as you move through the second half. Trey Grooms : Got it. Thanks, Mary Andrews. That's super helpful. And I guess just to make sure I'm clear on the comment, Tom, that you had around pricing. So 11% to 13%, I guess, just coming out and asking is, is there any -- what is the assumption around midyear price increases that are baked into that? I know you guys have been had the opinion and you said on the last call, I think that you guys were going to be targeting pretty aggressively in the first half -- or excuse me, in the first of the year, but any kind of comment around what's in that for midyear? Thomas Hill : Sure. So let me just step back and talk about pricing in aggregates. If you remember, about [40%] of our work is fixed plant, and we price that once or twice a year. We had discussions in October, November for January 1 price increases. I thought those went very well. Those are in place. And we'll just have to see what happens as we progress through the year and what the market calls for in the individual markets of how that's priced. But the other 60% of your business is bid work and we're bidding jobs as we speak. That's something -- it's something you earn every day, and it's a continuous improvement effort. And so, what we're bidding now will ship in the third or fourth quarter. So all in, we're very confident on our pricing guidance, but some of that's got to be earned as we progress through the year and earned every day with our customers. Trey Grooms : Understood. Got it. Thanks for the clarity there, Tom. Super helpful. Keep up the good work. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Kathryn. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Kathryn Thompson : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question today. Tagging on just with the pricing question, but really pulling the string more in terms of the balance of price and cost. Given there's been so much volatility in '21 and '22, could you clarify the confidence that you have in unit margin growth into '23 in light of the historic volatility just with that price cost? It would be helpful too if you focus it on the aggregate side, but also given the divestiture of your Northeast concrete assets, giving any color for expectations for unit margins? Or just any type of profitability color on that segment would be helpful. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Yes. Great question. I think that as you look at 2022, we set records in unit margins, and we're very pleased with our growth there. We'll grow those again in '23, as we said, mid-teens. And what you're seeing there is the Vulcan way of sales and the Vulcan way of operating disciplines at work. We -- you saw us set new goals for long-term unit margin growth at our Investor Day in September. I think that over the last four or five years, the team has done great work on this very important metric. They have shown that they are never satisfied, that they're always hungry for continuous improvement. And I'm proud of their performance and the culture that they developed and their commitment to excellence. That said, my confidence is very high on our target guidance on unit margin growth because of our past performance and our consistency. Mary Andrews? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. Tom highlighted the consistency. And I think if we look over the last three years, we've grown our cash gross profit per ton in 11 of 12 quarters. And as we expect to continue to do that in 2023 and to accelerate. And I think another important reminder about both the level of unit margin expansion in 2022 and also a contributing factor to the contraction in aggregate gross margin percentage is that we had a considerable headwind year-over-year since we report inventory using LIFO as we believe it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. So in periods of increasing costs like we saw in 2022, LIFO will result in higher cost of revenues than under FIFO. And pretax, in 2022, we took an incremental $54 million of costs through the P&L instead of putting it on the balance sheet, if we had used FIFO method in both periods. So I think we really showed strong unit margin in 2022 with some considerable cost challenges. Thomas Hill : Kathryn, I'd also expect to see unit margin growth in the other product lines. Kathryn Thompson : Okay, great. All right, thank you very much. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Hi. Good morning, Thomas Hill : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : On the aggregates volume guidance, should we think of that as really an organic kind of apples-to-apples percentage change? Or is there any kind of impact from maybe downstream divestitures impacting upstream shipments? Or are there sort of supply agreements in place to take care of that or any volume impact from Mexico? Just wondering if there's any impact there and if you could bridge those. Thomas Hill : Yes. On the divestitures, I don't see the impact on volumes as I think we'll continue to service those Ready-Mix plants on Mexico or acquisitions that we made partially in -- for partial year in '22, they're built into the guidance. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Jerry Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good Morning. Jerry Revich : Hi Tom and Mary Andrews. Good morning. Really interesting price cost spread for aggregates this year as you folks catch up on the inflation we essentially saw in '22. I'm wondering as the exit rate heading into '24 is going to show some pretty good pricing momentum for you folks. And I'm wondering as you look at other cycles in the past, Tom, is there a precedent for another year of significant above-trend price versus cost that's potentially feasible, maybe similar to what we saw 15 years ago. Thomas Hill : Yes. I think that's built into our guidance in that mid-teen unit margin growth. And as I said a little bit earlier, I think the cadence of that is your comps and pricing are easier in the first half than the second half. And but you're -- but the flip is true on costs. Your comps are going to be easier in the second half on cost. So I think we're pretty consistent at how we -- at our ability to grow unit margin as we progress through the year. And I've also -- like I said, we've been very consistent about being able to do that. So I don't see that being choppy. Jerry Revich : Sorry, I was just asking the momentum heading into '24. So, is there prior points in time that could give you confidence that this period of outsized price cost and unit profitability growth above trend can continue into '24? Thomas Hill : As always, visibility to growing public demand is a good thing for price. And I think we are -- our folks are quite disciplined on how they earn price. So let's get through '23, but we'll be ready to tackle our challenges and maximize unit profitability as we go into '24 and make sure we fall back on those disciplines of the Vulcan way of selling and the Vulcan way of operating. Jerry Revich : Sounds good. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Feniger, Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. Can you just help us understand how much were costs like energy, raw materials, diesel? How much was that up incrementally in 2022 versus 2023 -- sorry, 2022 versus 2021. And what are you kind of baking in there for 2023? Thomas Hill : So Mary, why don't you take '22 and I'll take '23? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. So energy was a considerable headwind in 2022 and it cost us about $225 million between diesel and liquid. And I think may be important context and reflecting back on 2022 and thinking about how it will impact 2023, and Tom can give some more color on that. But is the fact that diesel in the fourth quarter of 2022 was almost 40% higher than the first quarter of 2022 and liquid likewise was almost 20% higher in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter. So I think that's the setup as we move into 2023. And Tom can comment more on sort of full-year '23? Thomas Hill : Yes. I think what we have in the plan right now is probably high single-digit. It's a combination of inflation, fuel, and labor. We'll feel -- as I said, we'll feel a bigger impact in the first half just due to the inflationary pressures that we felt kind of escalate as we went through the year. That being said, I think all of that is partially offset with operating efficiencies and improvements generated by the Vulcan way of operations. I think our folks are all over that. And how we do that, many of the details we illustrated in our September Investor Day. But I do have pretty good confidence that they can keep some of that at bay just by improving the key metrics that of throughput and downtime and preventive maintenance that really drive your cost. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And specific to the energy in 2023, our expectation is that, that will be more stable, but it will remain at these high levels, which is what will result in a considerable headwind early in the year and then that will moderate as the year progresses. Michael Feniger : Great. And when you look at the portfolio, Tom, you divested some concrete assets in the Northeast. I'm just curious, is there any further portfolio moves we could see going forward? Like how do you kind of view the Asian assets after kind of a couple of challenging quarters with a lot of moving parts that impacted the year? First, you can kind of comment on how you feel the health of those -- that part of your portfolio long term. Thank you. Thomas Hill : I think that as always, we look at our assets as a group of assets that have to stand on their own and if this were something -- were something more about some us, then we'll divest of it and put that money back-in our aggregates business, which you've seen us do in the past. Right now, the markets that we have concrete businesses in are privileged concrete markets, and we're pleased with them. Obviously, inflationary pressures you had price-chasing costs. And like we did in asphalt, we'll catch that and bypass it and get back to growing margins. But I think the markets where we bought into, we like them, we kept our aggregates business in New York and New Jersey. But so far, so good, and we think we can continue to improve our returns as we march through 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Mike. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Mike Dahl : Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on the public side. I don't know maybe something a little bit of nuance here. We've been hearing about how strong backlog and lettings are recently in terms of the growth, and now you're seeing kind of some modest impacts more as we get through the year and more meaningful in '24. I think if we rewound back three or six months, the thought was that the tailwinds might come a little bit sooner than that. So in the context of your low single-digit expectations for public, maybe help us understand if there's something different in the market that you've seen in terms of timing or level of distribution or timing? Is there something related to just the labor constraints? How would you characterize what seems to be maybe a little delay in some of the infrastructure tailwinds? Thomas Hill : Look, I think it is as good of an infrastructure tailwind as we've ever seen in decades. That being said, as you heard me say before, highway work comes slower than anybody anticipates it to, but it's coming. So overall highway funding is way up. The sector is in great shape as is the entire public sector. State DOT funding is extremely healthy. And then you've got IIJ revenues that are going to be reflected in fiscal year '23, '24 proposed budgets. Our top states are sustaining robust lettings. And that IIJ funding will hit lettings in '23. And it will really impact 23/24 as we move forward. I'll give you a couple of examples. If you think about Arizona, they'll let 45 projects in the first half of this year. If you go and move to California, the total dollars -- project dollars in '23 will be a record coupled with record highway lettings that we saw in November, December. Texas is at $10 billion budget, and they'll have $7.4 billion of lettings in the second half of their fiscal year, which is March through August. And then on the more to come list, that's what's there that we know is coming. But on the more to come list, in Florida, you got Governor DeSantis proposed a 33% increase in the FDOT program that would impact lettings in the -- particularly second potentially in the second half of the year or first half of next year. He's also -- this initial $7 billion that he's wanting to accelerate for some 20 projects, congestion projects. Tennessee's governor proposed to double the '23 '24 TDOT budget. So for this year, it's a matter of timing and how fast do lettings get to project shipping. But I want to step back and say it's nothing but timing. This sector is in very good shape and as good shape as we've ever seen it and growing. Mike Dahl : Got it. Okay, thanks for that. Very helpful, Tom. Thomas Hill : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hi, good morning Thomas Hill : Good morning. Tyler Brown : Hi Tom, I actually wanted to go back to the Analyst Day and talk about the progress on your logistics excellence I think the next-gen plant operations. I'm just kind of curious how those initiatives are rolling out? And are they expected to be a material driver in expanding margins in '23? Or are those more on the come in, say, beyond '23 into '24? Thomas Hill : I think what you'll see in '23 is maybe a little bit of incremental impact. It will be more of a '24 play. And that's a little bit of what we said in the Investor Day about the operating piece where we're just really rolling it out in '22, but more of an impact in '23. But for logistics, we're doing more rollout development and '23, probably a bigger impact in '24. Tyler Brown : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies. Phil Ng : Hi, Tom. Just piggybacking on Mike's question earlier on the public side of things. The low single-digit growth does seem a little more muted than your two public peers are guiding for this year. Curious if it's a function of maybe you guys are a little more levered to bigger projects, so that's more timing related. And I guess it would be really helpful to kind of give us a perspective as to how you think public will grow as we exit 2023 and perhaps more importantly 2024 when you get the full impact of IIJA. Thomas Hill : Well, I think that it's -- I'll take the second part of that question first. 2024, I think we'll see a lot more maturing of the DOTs, getting work to shipments. And if you look at the level of lettings that we'll see throughout the year, that sets us up extremely well for 2024 because they get them left, they get the jobs out there, get them started. And so we entered '24 with a higher level of starts that have gone to aggregate shipments. So I think that obviously, you've got to wait and we'll see how that progresses and the DOTs able to get the work let and out for that they -- the projections they have. On big work, it's hard for me to really judge what some of my peers are doing because I don't get to look at their backlogs and look at their work. So a little bit hard to judge. Now you are insightful in the fact that very large jobs take longer to get from letting to start because they're complicated and there's a lot that goes into it from procuring land and permits, and just more detailed larger engineering things that have to happen and pre work that has to go into it. So we do have a number of large jobs in our backlogs. And as I said, they do take longer, but comparing it to my peers, it's just tough to do. Phil Ng : I mean would it be fair, Tom, looking out to 2024, we see like mid-single-digit plus growth in public? Or is that still too optimistic at this point? Thomas Hill : Well, obviously, too early to call because you've got to see what's happening in these lettings, but let's all be hopeful on that one. Phil Ng : Okay. I appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the non-res side of the ledger, the outlook for flat volumes this year. Just wondering if you can maybe break out what you're seeing in your markets and your backlogs on the heavier nonres side, so things like LNG, manufacturing warehouses, things of that nature versus lever commercial? Thomas Hill : Yes. I think the very large projects is really -- it's really encouraging. We're seeing a number of them. I mean, I'll give you some examples. You got aluminum plant here in Alabama, a 100 plant in Savannah, Georgia, the GM battery plant that we'll be shipping in Tennessee, the Ford F-150 plant in Kentucky and a big solar plant in North Alabama. All of those are hundreds of thousands of tons per job, and so very good work. We have some concerns on does the light non-res follow home construction. That's one piece. And while on heavier res, the starts look good right now. It's really -- the question is and what we're trying to see and can't see yet is what's behind those because you've got commercial loans that have been challenged for four quarters. So right now, the leading indicators look good. And we'll have to wait and see on the other -- see how it starts to trend? I think all in all, we try to be thoughtful as we assume flat but remember, that flat is at extremely high levels, and this sector is not overbuilt. So those set us up good for the future even if there is -- that some of the lighter stuff follows homebuilding, you've got a lot of heavy behind that, too. Garik Shmois : Understood. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Hughes from Truist. Keith Hughes : Thank you. I had some questions on the cost that was referred to earlier on the high single-digit increases in cost. Could you say again, on energy, are you seeing energy just kind of roll forward at current prices or is there any change up or down in the first half of the year? Thomas Hill : A little bit -- though the first half of the year, energy costs will be up because of costs. We think it remains at elevated levels. But in the first part of the year, there's no question that everything, including energy, will be up because we saw such a quick rise of inflation throughout the year. So the comps get easier in cost as we go through the year just because the cost rose last year. But for energy in the first half, yes, will be -- it will be a headwind for us. Keith Hughes : And if you strip out the energy, what does year-over-year cost growth look like and other enlighting items kind of percentage? Thomas Hill : I would take it in pieces. I think that most of it is up mid to high single digits, and that's everything from electricity to parts, to the labor, just kind of all of it is up. It's just going to get hit harder in the first six months of the second six months. Keith Hughes : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Tom and Mary Andrews. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good Morning, Thomas Hill : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Tom, just maybe you could share a little bit about a couple of your -- where some of your larger -- where are some of the surprises you may see given the dynamics you just put forth, whether it's regional, whether it's California, the weather was very hard, obviously, from the end of the quarter, beginning of this year. Where are some of the areas you think there could be some upside surprises and a couple of areas where there needs to be a little bit more concerned about some of the project flows that you're anticipating? Thomas Hill : I think the big question for all of this is timing of highway projects. And that's in every DOT we have. All of them have great funding. All of them have great plans, all of them have really good lettings. It's how fast do they get that work to shipping aggregates. And I think that's the biggest question that we will have to watch as we go through the year. Now the good part about that question, if it goes faster, that's great but, as I've said, the highway work, it just takes longer to get there, than we think than anybody ever thinks it does, but it gets there. Michael Dudas : So is that the delta between minus 2 and minus 6 on your volume expectations? Thomas Hill : I would tell you that I think that's probably the biggest factor in the range. Yes. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Tom. Mark Warren : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Adam Thalhimer : Can I get your help with your margin guidance because you're giving us aggregates cash gross profit per ton. I want to convert that back to you just your reported aggregates gross margin. I think you're guiding to, call it, 100 to 200 basis points of gross -- aggregates gross margin improvement this year, but I'm just not sure. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. That's right. We do expect aggregates gross margin expansion, I'd say, at least at those levels and also on EBITDA margins, too, this will be a year where we can call back to some of our more historical levels. Adam Thalhimer : And do you see a lot of variability between quarters or is that pretty evenly throughout the year? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. I think from a margin standpoint, we expect consistent improvement throughout the year. As Tom said, it will be -- first half will be more price, more cost and second half will be more moderate price and more moderate cost. But I think on the margin side, we should see good growth in -- all throughout the year. Adam Thalhimer : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Rohit Seth from Seaport Research Partners. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Rohit Seth : Hi, good morning. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just clear to -- clear up on the nonresi. You talked about the light and heavy non-resi, what is the mix between the two and your total non-resi exposure? Thomas Hill : I think it's probably -- right now, we're probably a lot heavier -- lot heavier on the heavy nonres as we saw the light catch-up -- had to catch up with residential growth. And it fell behind a little bit. So I think you still got some runway with light res as it has as it lags single-family, but the heavier piece of this will be a much heavier piece with us a majority of ours will be in heavy res. Rohit Seth : Okay. So nonres is what, 30% of your sales, your volumes? Thomas Hill : Yes. So that's a pretty good round number. Rohit Seth : Okay. And then just on capital allocation, can you maybe comment on what the deal market looks like at the moment? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. I think we still see good activity. We have -- our teams are always out looking for opportunities. I think specifically in these kind of environments. I mean, sometimes, there may become a disconnect between sellers' expectations and buyers' valuations. But as we talked about, we have a great ability to generate a lot of cash, and we're always looking for ways to put that to work growing the franchise, particularly through the bolt-on acquisitions. And those, I think, are more about timing on the seller side than anything else. Thomas Hill : Yes. You saw us complete several of those really strategic ones in 2022, very important, particularly to our California, our critical California and Texas markets. We always have a few of those that we're working on. We're very picky about it. We're very disciplined about it. But -- and while years in which they may be the future is not as clear. Sometimes they get harder. I wouldn't expect a big turn-off or turn-on with acquisitions kind of a steady flow like we've seen. So I think there will be some out there. The timing of that will be seen, but we'll keep plugging at that and be disciplined about it. Rohit Seth : Understood. Thank you for taking my questions. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : It appears you have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Tom for any additional closing remarks. Thomas Hill : Thank you for your time this morning. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter and throughout the year. Please stay safe and we look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Travis, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions]. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin, sir. Mark Warren : Good morning and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.

In the interest of time, please limit your Q&A participation to one question. This will allow for more questions during our time together. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thanks all of you for joining our call this morning. Vulcan Materials is well-positioned to deliver attractive growth in 2023. We got off to a solid start in the first quarter and now expect to deliver between $1.85 billion and $1.95 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year, a 14% to 20% improvement versus the prior year. In the quarter, we generated $338 million of adjusted EBITDA, a 15% improvement over the prior year. Despite lower volumes in each of our major product lines, total gross profit improved 12% and gross margin expanded by 90 basis points. I'm pleased with our team's execution as they remain focused on our Vulcan of selling and Vulcan way of operating disciplines. The pricing environment is healthy. Year-over-year adjusted average price improved 19% in the quarter. Prices also improved in our downstream products by 15% in asphalt and 12% in concrete. As always, we are focused on capitalizing on pricing momentum and controlling costs to expand our margins. In the Aggregates segment, gross margin improved by 170 basis points. Shipments declined 2% versus a prior year with wide variations across markets. Some areas benefited from favorable weather and carryover shipments from the wet fourth quarter. Others like California and Texas were challenged by excessive rainfall. All geographies delivered double-digit price improvement. And importantly, our cash gross profit per ton improved by 23% in the quarter, surpassing $8 per ton on a trading 12-month basis. In asphalt, gross margins improved by 220 basis points despite higher natural gas and liquid asphalt cost and 11% lower volumes. Significant rainfall negatively impacted shipments in California and Arizona our largest asphalt markets. Prices improved by 15% and more than offset higher raw materials costs. Cash unit profitability in asphalt improved by 90% in the quarter. The concrete segments cash gross profit was negatively impacted by the 2022 divestiture of our New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania operations, as well as weather impacted volume in Texas and California, and the resulting cost challenges. Now shifting to the dynamic demand environment, which remains mixed, both in terms of end users and timing. We expect modest growth in overall public demand but contraction in private demand. While single-family housing starts continue to fall, some markets have begun to show early signs of decelerating declines. Multi-family housing starts have recently turned negative. However, they remained at high levels, particularly in Vulcan markets and continue to dampen some of the impact of single-family weakness. Affordability is the fundamental driver of the declines in single-family activity. Low inventories, favorable demographic trends and employment growth in our markets continue to support demand for new residential construction. While the pipeline of private, non-residential projects remain supportive of near-term demand starts have eased in recent months. A positive trend in non-residential construction activity is the increasingly broad base composition of starts. Industrial and manufacturing projects now count for more than 60% of starts. Recent trends in supply chain management, onshoring and clean energy investment are among the catalysts for this shift in the drivers of non-residential construction. Our geography and service capabilities enable us to capitalize on these large projects. We have booked and are currently shipping to a number of these projects in many of our key markets, such as battery plants, electric vehicle manufacturing facilities, LNG facilities and large warehouse parks. On the public side, momentum is building with trailing 12-month highway starts now exceeding $100 billion. The infrastructure investment in Jobs Act dollars are flowing. The impact of these historic levels of public construction awards on 2023 aggregate shipments will depend upon how quickly starts can turn into shipments. Other infrastructure starts are also growing with trailing 12 months starts up 23%, in addition to significant IIJA funding for water, energy, ports, and airports, strong state and municipal revenue support, non-highway infrastructure investment. Overall, 2023 demand for Aggregates continues to be dependent upon the depth of decline in residential construction activity and the timing of highway starts converting into aggregate shipments. Our durable Aggregates business and best-in-class execution position us well to successfully navigate any shifts in demand. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our first quarter performance and update 2023 outlook. Mary Andrews? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. In the first quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points with solid operational execution and disciplined SAG cost management. Our SAG expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 60 basis points in the quarter and moved below 7% on a trailing 12-month basis. We remain focused on continuing to leverage our SAG cost base while making strategic investments in talent and technology to support our business needs. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.2x at quarter end squarely within our stated target range of 2x to 2.5x. Our investment grade balance sheet gives us flexibility and optionality to continue investing in both organic and inorganic opportunity. During the quarter, we invested $113 million in capital expenditures and continue to expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million for the full-year. As we allocate capital, we are focused on improving our return on invested capital. On a trailing 12-month basis, our return on invested capital improved sequentially by 20 basis points from year-end to 13.7%. Tom shared with you our increased adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2023. On the heels of a strong 2022 in which adjusted EBITDA improved by 12%, we now expect to exceed that growth in 2023 with 14% to 20% improvement. Based on the success of our Aggregates pricing efforts in the first quarter, which yielded 10% sequential improvement and 19% mix adjusted year-over-year improvement, we now expect prices to improve approximately 15% for the full-year. Coupling the strong pricing momentum with our industry-leading operational execution, we expect to deliver even stronger year-over-year improvement in cash gross profit per ton than our original guidance. All other aspects of the full-year guidance we communicated in February remain unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews. In closing, I want to remind you of two things that we are focused on each and every day. First, keeping our people safe. Our people are the lifeblood of our business and our culture. Second, improving unit profitability and growing earnings regardless of the demand environment. Our Aggregates led business and our best-in-class execution positioned us well for driving long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. And now, Mary Andrews and I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms, Stephens. Trey Grooms : Nice work on the quarter and Aggregates pricing particularly strong. So hats off to you and the team for such strong execution there. And Tom, I was hoping maybe you could talk a little more specifically about the overall pricing environment and your thoughts on kind of the rest of the year as we look through the balance of the year for pricing. Tom Hill : Sure, Trey. As you saw, prices up 19% mix adjusted for the quarter. So a great start. Our January 1 price increases were successful and they were really broad base. So I appreciate our team's hard work on earning price and based on that success, you saw us raise the guidance to 15% for the full-year. As -- Trey, as we said, the pricing comps will get a lot tougher in the second half of the year. So a good start to the year, but it's always worked to be done to earn price. And we feel really good about the 15%. But remember, you still have to take that price to the bottom line, which is what happened in the first quarter where we improved our unit margins by some 23%. And that kind of unit margin expansion is generally consistent with what was in our guidance. And that's just the bulk way of ops in the bulk way of selling at work. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Trey, one other thing on that note, on the margin side, we were pleased to for Aggregates gross margin to expand 170 basis points in the first quarter after being compressed each quarter year-over-year last year. As we took those rapidly rising costs through the P&L and our pricing efforts in 2022 that Tom talked about and has begun now into 2023, returned us to gross margin growth. And we would expect the year-over-year improvement to continue to accelerate as the year progresses. Operator : Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott, Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you for the question and congratulations on the strong start. Tom, you mentioned kind of some nuances developing within the end market because I think that's one thing that's different this year versus maybe some other cycles in the past. Would love to get your kind of thoughts around what's happening on the private non-res side since there's seems to be more moving parts as we're looking forward. Tom Hill : Good morning, Stanley. Yes, you're right. Non-res construction as shipments continues to be really healthy and we saw that evidenced in the first quarter. We would continue to expect the non-residential sector to maintain the really high levels that we came off of last year. And it's really driven by warehouses, distribution, and now manufacturing and industrial. If I had to risk and reward that sector, I would put the risk in that sector would include maybe some slowing in warehouses. We have not seen that yet, but we're watching it. And the other question I would have is, does light non-res that follows subdivision, does it start to slow again? Haven't seen that yet, but watching it. Now the flip side, the potential upside to shipments in non-residential construction for me would include the number of massive industrial and manufacturing projects that are on the horizon or just starting to ship. To give you some color around that, we have now have some 20 -- excuse me, some 12 major industrial projects most of which are in our backlogs that total 8.5 million tons. Now, some of those are multi-year projects. All that's not going to go in 2023. So I would describe non-res right now as very healthy so far, so good for a healthy non-residential demand in 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari, Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Hey, I think previously you talked about ag shipments to public projects expected to be up maybe low-single-digits in 2023 with IIJA maybe flowing through in the back half. And I was wondering if you had any sort of updated thoughts on the cadence of those public volumes over the remaining quarters of the year, or maybe between the first half and the second half. How we should think about the flow-through especially with IIJA projects? Tom Hill : Yes. I would tell you back half loaded simple answer to that question, the sector -- the highway sector is really the whole public sector, but particularly highways is set up for a really robust future. Funding is at all-time record levels. And importantly, all three areas of funding of government are at record levels. You got federal, state, and municipal all at all-time highs. And all of that is starting to flow into lettings. Give you a little color around lettings, which are really healthy in California. And the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year combined those lettings will be over $2 billion, which is an all-time high for two quarters in California. Moving to Texas is even better. And the first two quarters of 2023, the lettings will be at some almost $8 billion, again, all-time high. So highway contract awards as we said are now over $100 billion. And we still -- so we'll still see -- we'll see 2023 shipments. We predict in low-single-digit, and that is just -- that is indicative of how much time it takes for those big lettings to flow-through the shipment, so a solid 2023, but a much larger growth in 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs. Tom Hill : Hi, Jerry. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Jerry Revich : Hi good morning, Tom, Mary Andrews, Mark, nice quarter. I wanted to ask a couple of things stood out in the quarter on the volume side, if we just think about normal seasonality off of your first quarter run rate, that suggests your volumes could actually be up year-over-year in the second quarter. And I'm just wondering is that consistent with the cadence that you're seeing in the business? And similar vein really strong gross margins for Aggregates in the quarter. Normally your margins are up 10 points, 2Q versus 1Q. And I'm wondering, is that the cadence we should be thinking about here as well? Thank you. Tom Hill : Yes, I'll take the volume and let Mary Andrews handle the margin. I think the volumes were in the quarter, we were down 2% and weather had a big play on that. Weather in California and Texas and Arizona were a drag on us. But the weather in the East and Southeast were really positive. And in the East and Southeast we probably had some volume that pushed from the fourth quarter last year, which had really wet weather into the first quarter of this year. As far as our outlook it really hasn't changed. The two -- negative two to six, we've got challenges in single-family, which are going to be more second half loaded. Non-res, as you heard me say is really solid and highways is coming on, but it takes a little time. I think for me the timing is going to be key of how fast those highway shipments go from lettings to shipments. But in all of this, I think is a backdrop. You -- we've got the Vulcan way of selling, the Vulcan way of operating, which gives me confidence that will continue to improve our performance regardless of demand challenges, which you've seen us do quarter in and quarter out over the last few years. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And Jerry, in terms of margins, yes, I think that the typical sequential improvement is what you should expect. And as I said on a year-over-year basis, we'll see significant acceleration quarter-to-quarter as we progress off that 170 basis points from the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Dahl, RBC Capital. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Mary Andrews, with respect to the other parts of the guidance, I think last quarter, I'm not sure if this was formal guide, but you talked about cost inflation being up high-single-digits and the release said that cost and ags was tracking consistent with expectations. So I'm wondering kind of if that's still the expectation and then if it is, is it right to think about from a gross profit per ton standpoint, the new price on top of that might suggest something in kind of like a low-20s year-on-year increase percentage wise for gross profit per ton? Tom Hill : Yes. Quickly, you're correct on your assumption on gross profit per ton improvements. If I step back and look at cost, we're still facing the impact of stubborn inflation in parts and services. If you looked in the first quarter, weather on the West had negatively impacted the first quarter cost. As -- but remember as we progress through the year, our comps on costs get a whole lot easier. So we're still guiding to the high-single-digit cost inflation. And I would describe that as probably higher than expected parts and services and also delays in delivery is costing us just because it keeps equipment down that's offset some by probably better than expected diesel cost. We'll -- but all that being said, we'll continue to work on our operating efficiencies to the Vulcan way of operating. But at this point, I think we're still very comfortable with that high-single-digit guide. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And Mike, just on the gross profit per ton and cash gross profit per ton improvement from the beginning, we thought that'd be much more consistent this year. And so that 23% you saw in the first quarter and the low-20s for the rest is a good assumption. Operator : Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson, Thompson Research Group. Tom Hill : Good morning, Kathryn. Kathryn Thompson : Good morning. Great quarter. Just have a clarification based on our channel checks, we're seeing as you already described pretty robust demand in the year and even possibly some tightness in materials in some key markets or multiple markets throughout the U.S., as we enter the construction season. In light of the strong pricing commentary you had in the quarter, does this open up the possibility for additional pricing actions mid-year? And then also along with that, more of a mid to long-term view, when you look at reassuring population shift and government supported funding for IIJA Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, how does this play into your mid to long-term view on pricing? Thanks so much. Tom Hill : Yes. I think that so as far as pricing the rest of the year, we did not assume a second half price increase in our 15% guide. That said, we are -- have announced mid-year price increases in most in the vast majority of our markets. We feel like you got to earn that first. So we'll report on our progress on those mid-year efforts in August as far as bid work, we're pushing price day in and day out on our bid work, and that's just part of our Vulcan way of selling. As far as the -- you're spot on the large projects both on the public side, highways and non-highway, we're going to see a lot more large projects and a lot more money flowing. We are also, as you said, starting to see the big manufacturing industrial projects, which we think continue well into the future. All of that bodes extremely well for pricing because that gives us and our customers' visibility to coming demand. And those large projects both public and the big industrial ones tend to be there's more surety to those projects then once they announce them they're going to happen and so that also gives surety demand, which is a very good backdrop for pricing. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Hughes, Truist Securities. Tom Hill : Hi, Keith. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Keith Hughes : Hey, thank you very much. I guess switching to the discussion on non-residential, specifically on heavy there's a lot of positives out there right now. How far of visibility do you have on that business? In other words, could we be seeing several years of really strong heavy work to be done? Tom Hill : Yes. That you are going to see a number of years both in manufacturing, industrial, and in the big energy projects along the coast. There is a healthy pipeline of that both in either they're budgeting, they're bidding, or they're engineering. And so I -- like you said, I believe we'll see years of this and I think it will really bode well both for volumes and price. Keith Hughes : And you're on that your light business that give that shorter cycle, your visibility is not nearly that long on light. Is that correct? Tom Hill : That's correct. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thielman, D.A. Davidson. Tom Hill : Hey, Brent. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Brent Thielman : Hey, good morning. Hey, Tom, I'm just curious on the balance, what was the hit from the residential sector this quarter because with volume only down 2%, including weather, just on the surface, it doesn't look like that much. Tom Hill : So if you look at it about half of our markets took a hit in res and about half were positive. So I'd tell you probably mid-single-digit. But as we said, the -- we'll feel the impact of the fall and starts permits and starts in single-family. We'll really feel that in the second half of the year. So pretty much as expected right now, I think it's a -- and plus weather in Arizona, Texas, and California masks some of that. So it's harder to see. But I -- we think that is more of a second half play as it -- as those starts have to go through the pipeline. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Ng, Jefferies. Tom Hill : Hi, Phil. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning, Phil. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is actually Colin [ph] on for Phil. I just wanted to touch on the geographic mix. I know pricing was aided by that favorable mix, but could you talk about how that mix might have helped gross margins and how we should think about that mix benefit going forward? Thank you. Tom Hill : I don't think it's going to -- I don't think it has a big play on gross margin. It was only 1% on price. So it really did not -- it really didn't have an impact on much impact on price or on margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Timna Tanners, Wolfe Research. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning, Timna. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning. Tom Hill : Hey, Tim. Hey. Timna Tanners : Two things I haven't heard you address, and I would like to hear from, please. One is just the labor markets broadly. I know it's been a bigger issue for your customers, but would appreciate and updated thoughts there. And then it's been I think May will be a year anniversary since the Mexican operations were shut and there's been some noise down there, so I would love your take on that as well. Thanks. Tom Hill : Yes. I would describe the labor market as easing. I think it's a combination of the labor market's easing, and I think we've gotten better with retention over the last year and done a lot of work on that. So it is still an issue, probably still a bigger issue for our customers, but not like it was 12 months ago or 18 months ago. On Mexico, really not a lot of change. We remain illegally shutdown and the proceedings with the NCRA tribunal continue, we would hope to get a ruling on that sometime in 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer, Thompson Davis. Tom Hill : Hey, Adam. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning guys. Great quarter. Tom Hill : Nice. Adam Thalhimer : Hi, I am starting to get questions from clients on the debt ceiling. If we don't get an increase, you think there's a risk to federal infrastructure support? Tom Hill : Well, I mean, that would be a first time that's happened, so I would -- since I would doubt that, that while everybody's ringing their hands over it, I think we'll solve this problem and we'll continue with our infrastructure spending. Adam Thalhimer : Yes. I mean, prior government shutdowns haven't been a big deal, have they? Tom Hill : Well, I don't want to see one, but I don't think it's going to impact our infrastructure projects. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dudas, Vertical Research. Tom Hill : Hey Michael. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Hey, good morning, gentlemen, Mary Andrews. Andrews, just can share your thoughts on how operating free cash flow went through the Q1 and how it looks for the rest of the year. And then maybe Tom, you could discuss the M&A pipeline and will we best guess do we see any visible activity by year-end with what's happening in the marketplace? Thank you. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. So we were pleased with our free cash flow. It's obviously very cash generative business over the trailing 12 months, our free cash flow conversion has stayed over 90%, so we are pleased with that result. And we'll be -- take our consistent disciplined approach as we think about how to allocate that capital along our waterfall priorities. Tom Hill : On M&A, it remains; I guess we have a number of smaller bolt-ons in the pipeline along with a number of Greenfields that we're working on. I would tell you kind of normal from the smaller bolt-on and Greenfield perspective, as far as large projects are large M&A, those tend to be lumpy. When they come along, we'll be in the game and we'll take advantage. And as always, we'll be disciplined and all of this about what markets we're in, what synergies are unique to us and what we pay for it. So -- and we look forward to reporting that as they come about. Operator : Our next question comes from Garik Shmois, Loop Capital. Tom Hill : Hi, Garik. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning, Garik. Garik Shmois : Hey, good morning. Nice quarter. Wanted to ask on the highway outlook, you're counting on demand showing up later this year. Curious just has the lag between project starts and when volumes occur, has that changed at all? Just given the size of the projects in the pipeline? Tom Hill : I think it's a little bit; we would always call that 9 months to 12 months. But larger projects can take longer just because of more complex engineering, more complex permitting and more complex planning around those. And when they run into a snag, it stops a big chunk of work or pushes it back. I would not change the 9 months to 12 months rule of thumb, except for every once in a while now you'll come across a multimillion ton highway project that can get pushed out past that limit. But I think the 9 months and 12 months is still a good rule of thumb. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor, Longbow Research. Tom Hill : Hey, David. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. David MacGregor : Hey, Tom and Andrews, congratulations on a strong quarter. Phenomenal. Tom Hill : Thank you. David MacGregor : Yes. I guess I'd be interested in just any update you've got on transportation. I know you've got some long haul tonnage there. You're talking about the strength down along the coast. How is that changing? Is it changing for the better? Do you view that as a potential risk and have you been able to lock up capacity and if so for how far forward? Tom Hill : I think as we talk about rock is still short on all coast and it's driven primarily by bottlenecks on railroads. I think the railroads are working hard to improve and they're making progress, but there's still gaps there. And I don't know that I see it as risk for 2023. It has its challenges but I think we'll work us with our partners in the railroad work through those challenges and be fine in 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Feniger, Bank of America. Tom Hill : Hey, Michael. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Michael Feniger : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two. So the first one, the pricing obviously very strong with 18.5% and your full-year range of 15%, so does pricing kind of finish the year -- actually the year below that range do you think we still are in that double-digit territory. I'm just trying to think of that pricing cadence. And then the second question, just the operating leverage and Aggregates, I think you typically target like a 60% flow-through is -- are there periods where that can be above that level? I guess I'm just trying to think out mid-year price increases, potentially sticking diesel rolling over. Could we see flow-through above that target range for certain periods? Thank you. Tom Hill : You can. First of all, on the flow-through piece of this, you can see that above and you can see it below inflation, your big inflationary jumps, put pressure on that, as we said, as does fuel. I think if you look at this year, I would be a little bit cautious because you're still going to have some really sticky inflationary pressures on parts and services. I think as what we've said is that as we progress to the year, the percentage price increase won't stay up at the 20% range because the -- you're comping over such a sequentially high marks through 2022 in price. The flip side of that is in cost, as we've said, you're seeing really high year-over-year cost at this point. They should ease as we go through the year because the inflationary comps ease as we go. That all that put all that together we think we're pretty consistent in that 20% range improvement in unit margins Operator : Our final question comes from Dillon Cumming, Morgan Stanley. Dillon Cumming : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask if you could put a finer point in some of the non-res commentary. I think there are just some concerns out there with regards to a tighter financing environment, how that could impact both the light and heavy non-res comments side of the equation. Just curious if you're hearing since then around that from customers and what the kind of latest update and the thinking there is. Tom Hill : I would put it this way. So far what we're seeing in non-res is really solid some shifting towards heavy industrial and manufacturing. But we've not seen any impact on our markets yet on non-residential. Now that being said, we're watchful and we're watching it, but so far, so good in non-res for 2023. But to your point, I think everybody's watching that, but we haven't seen any impact at this point. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill for any closing remarks. Tom Hill : We appreciate your interest and your time this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to seeing you throughout the quarter to update you on our progress. We hope that you and your families remain healthy and safe and we'll talk to you throughout the quarter. Thanks. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

My name is Angela, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Mary Andrews Carlisle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted at our website. Please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation and other SEC filings. As the operator said, in the interest of time, please limit your Q&A participation to one question. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for your interest in Vulcan Materials today. Our results through the first half of 2023 highlight both the attractive fundamentals of our aggregates-led business and Vulcan's commitment to compounding profitability through our solid execution of our Vulcan web selling and both with operating strategic disciplines. I'm proud of our teams for delivering yet another quarter of improvement in our trailing 12-month aggregates cash gross profit per ton. That marks 20 of the last 22 quarters. This exceptional execution, coupled with better-than-expected demand environment gives us confidence in our ability to deliver between $1.9 billion and $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year. In the quarter, we generated $595 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is a 32% improvement over the prior year. Gross margin expanded by 480 basis points, and importantly, each product line delivered year-over-year improvement. In the Aggregates segment, gross margin improved by 290 basis points. Cash gross profit per ton improved by 22% with healthy year-over-year price improvement and moderating year-over-year cost increases. Shipments declined a modest 1% in the quarter, but were varied across markets. On one hand, we saw a solid growth in our key southeastern markets, where we have the most attractive Aggregates footprint. And we were pleased with the rebound of sales in California after a very wet first quarter. On the other hand, weather continued to be a challenge in Texas. And remember, softer residential activity wait on most markets. All geographies benefited from the continued strong underlying price environment. Our mix adjusted sales price improved 15% in the quarter. Attractive price growth should continue to drive improvement in our unit profitability as we progress through the back half of this year and into next year. In Asphalt, cash gross profit nearly tripled from the prior year to $66 million, and cash unit profitability improved over $10 a ton. Volume growth of 16%, price improvement of 9% and lower liquid asphalt costs all contribute to the stable results. Gross margin improved almost 1,200 basis points. Concrete cash unit profitability improved by 24% in the quarter, and this is despite lower volumes that were impacted by the slowdown in residential construction activity. Prior year Concrete segment benefited for the contribution of the now divested New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania Concrete operations. Now starting with residential. Let me provide a few thoughts about each end market. To date, the impact of the slowdown in residential activity has not been as significant as most of us initially feared. Recent permits and starts were showing that some areas have reached the bottom, and the cinema among homebuilders is much improved. These trends along with the solid underlying fundamentals for residential demand growth such as low inventories, favorable demographic trends and employment growth in our market suggests that single-family demand will bottom in the second half of this year and be -- and then start recovering thereafter. In the private nonresidential construction segment, starts remained at healthy levels, with particular strength in large manufacturing and industrial projects. Our strong Southeastern footprint and logistics innovation efforts are making us a supplier of choice on many of these projects. As an example, we have booked and are currently shipping to projects such as battery plants, electric vehicle manufacturing facilities, LNG facilities and large warehouse parks. On the public side, demand is unfolding largely as we expected, Funding from the infrastructure investment and Jobs Act is beginning to flow through and the pipeline is building with trailing 12-month highway starts up over 20%. 2024 state budgets are at very healthy levels. And internally, our bookings and backlog reflect this increased activity. The level of this year's shipments will depend upon how quickly this increased activity converts to shipments. We expect accelerating growth into next year and continued growth for the next several years. Trailing 12-month other infrastructure starts are also over -- up over 20%. In addition to significant IIJA funding for water, energy, ports and shipments, strong state and local revenue support growth in non-highway investments. Based on the improved private demand backdrop, our first half shipment -- and our first half shipments, we now expect Aggregates volumes to decline between 1% to 4% in 2023 and as compared to our initial expectations of a decline between 2% and 6%. Of course, regardless of the demand environment, our focus is to consistently improve unit profitability and grow earnings that we create value for our shareholders. We're well positioned to do exactly that this year and deliver approximately 20% year-over-year improvement in both our cash gross profit per ton and adjusted EBITDA. And now I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our second quarter and an update for 2023 outlook. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Our strong operational performance through the first 6 months in this year exhibits the benefits of our strategic focus on enhancing our core. We have improved our adjusted EBITDA margin by 350 basis points year-to-date through a combination of gross margin expansion and disciplined SAG cost management. This operational execution and resulting cash generation have allowed us to deploy capital toward each of our long-standing priorities, to improve our return on invested capital and to maintain the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $677 million in maintenance and growth capital including strategic greenfields. Additionally, we have deployed $340 million for acquisitions, and we've returned $271 million to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We have improved our return on invested capital by 110 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis. And we have reduced our leverage on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis to 2x at June 30, 2023, from 2.5x at June 30, 2022. We are well positioned to execute on our strategic objectives of further enhancing our core and also expanding our reach. Talent and technology are critical to achieve our business objectives, and we continue to invest in both while remaining focused on further leveraging our SAG costs. Trailing 12-month, SAG expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved by 50 basis points. Now let me shift to the updates to our full year guidance. As Tom mentioned, we now expect to generate between $1.9 billion and $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2023, a 17% to 23% improvement over the prior year. Our revised outlook results in the update to our aggregates volume expectations that Tom described, in addition to the momentum in our Asphalt business. With our non-aggregates businesses now in margin recovery mode, we expect to generate approximately $295 million of cash gross profit from our downstream businesses. With 50% to 55% of the total expected from Asphalt and 45% to 50% of the total expected from Concrete. We continue to expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million on maintenance and growth capital. Additionally, we expect to spend approximately $200 million on opportunistic purchases of strategic reserves in California, North Carolina and Texas, 3 important markets for Vulcan Materials. Because reserves are critical to our long-term success, our land portfolio is extensive and a strategic focus for us. We take a disciplined approach to securing high-quality reserves, the timing of which often depends on a combination of availability, alternative use of the cash and tax efficiency. We manage the entire life cycle of our land to create maximum value for the business, for our shareholders and for our communities, putting land to work both before and after mining. Our excess properties once completely mined and often reclaimed to their highest and best use can generate significant value such as the 2021 sale of previously mined property in Southern California that was reclaimed for commercial and retail development and sold for over $180 million. Of course, the timing of buying and selling land can be uneven, but our focus is on the strategic management of our land portfolio. All other aspects of the full year guidance, as reaffirmed or updated in May remain unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews. In closing, I want to thank and congratulate our teams on an outstanding performance in the first half of this year, and I want to challenge them to remain focused on our Vulcan web selling and Vulcan web operating disciplines so that we can continue to compound improvements and drive value for our shareholders. Most importantly, we will remain committed to each other and keeping each other safe. And now Mary Andrews and I will be glad to take the questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms : Nice work in the quarter. Tom Hill : Thanks, Trey. Trey Grooms : So I guess I wanted to touch on the guide specifically the increase in your volume outlook for the year, I think, Tom, and I know you have some things maybe from a high level, but could you maybe go into a little bit more detail on the primary drivers there, especially as you kind of look on the private side, on res and private non-res, and is that adjustment that you've made here for the full year based more on what you've seen in the results year-to-date or an improvement in the outlook for the balance of the year? Tom Hill : This last part of that is, I'd say both. We had a strong start, and I think things are looking better than what we had thought at the beginning of the year. Volume in the quarter was only down 1%. It was a great recovery in California, where we had a big washout in the first quarter. Texas was wet in the first quarter, it was wet in the second quarter, causing shipments to be down year-over-year. Interesting in the second quarter, the Southeast was also wet. But after those wet days, we're seeing a faster recovery in these markets. I mean, the volumes go up as soon as it drives out, volumes pop and so that's good news for all of us. The private demand has been stronger than we anticipated. Both single-family and multifamily shipments have held up better than I think our original projections. Nonres has also been better, as we said, driven by the heavy side. So that's why we raised our guidance to negative 1% to negative 4%. Highways, I think, finishes the year about where we thought low single digit. We got really backlogs and bookings are growing. So we'll really build in 2024. But at the end of it, the private side was just stronger -- has been stronger and will be stronger than we originally anticipated. Operator : The next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Just wanted to piggyback on Trey's question with respect to the volume outlook. I was wondering, if you could speak a little bit more just for the light non-res side that the players are recognizing that the heavy piece has been strong. Are you seeing any change in trend there? And then also highways are -- it sounds like as expected this year. Just curious if there's any visibility to what kind of growth we might anticipate into 2024. Tom Hill : I'll take non-res first. As I said, it's been a lot better than we thought. It's really driven by as you would expect, warehouse, distribution center. And now we've got the heavy industrial projects coming on, which have been very helpful. I would say a little bit of risk in some geographies and some sectors next year as we've seen maybe some slow in starts in Texas and warehouses. That said, if you look at that segment, warehouse segment in some of our stronger markets like -- strong markets like Georgia, Florida, California, Arizona, we're still seeing growth in starts and warehouses in those markets. So a little bit mixed bag of warehouses. I'd say other really good news in non-res is that we continue to see the big growth in the heavy industrial projects in our footprint. And these projects carry substantial volume needs. We have, I think, 11 of these big projects that we've already booked, most of them were already shipping on, and they'll carry out through 2024. On top of that, we're currently bidding on a number of projects that, as you know, won't ship until '24, '25. So in this sector, geography really does matter. So better growth in non-res than I think we originally expected. I'm sorry, your second question was on how we demand. It's really a matter of timing. We're seeing a lot of growth in -- we're seeing growth in bidding. The funding, as you know, the federal side, the state side and the local side is very good. Highway lettings continue to build our bookings in our backlogs and highways continues to build. And as you know, what we're bidding today, and what we're looking today, we'll ship in '24. So again, low single digit in the sector in '23, but is setting up very well for '24 and '25 and '26. Operator : The next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Could you guys talk about the pricing environment? You mentioned pretty broad-based momentum to the first half of the year. You did leave the pricing guidance unchanged. Is that regional mix? Is it maybe some timing? And to what level are you guys thinking about second price increases and maybe even how that carries off into 2024? Tom Hill : Yes. I would tell you that the pricing in '23 is unfolding as we thought it would. Prices were up 15% in the quarter. We expect going to be up 15% that carry through the full year. I think if I step back and remember the sequence in pricing was very different between '22 and '23. In '23, as we told you, we went out much higher, much earlier than we did in 2022. We've gotten more price in '23. We got more price in '23, and we've gotten it earlier. So if you kind of look at -- a good reference would be Slide 5 in that deck. And if you looked at '22, the full year, year-over-year from January 1 to December 31, we went up above 53. So from the beginning of this year until the end of June for '23, we're already up $2.28. So it is compounding, it is much faster, much higher. Second half price increases while they were mixed, will only help that. I'd tell you they're more -- they really are really a good setup for 2024, and we'll continue this momentum. The reason why is -- moment is very good, as you know, but demand is looking better. The private side is better. The public side is growing. So all of us in the sector have very good visibility to a more positive ramp picture. And our customers, I would tell you, continue to be quite confident. So I feel good about the momentum. We're right now planning our January 1 price increases, which will go out in a few months. And I would expect us, again, to go out higher earlier than we did. What point to this, though, and I think really important is our ultimate goal is to take that price to the bottom line. And that's really important that we continue that margin expansion. We're up low 20s in the -- we're in the first quarter, low 20s in the second quarter. We expect that to continue for the next few quarters. And that is a really important number. And we get there in the second half of the year a little different, probably a little -- as a percentage-wise, we got tougher comps on price, but easier comps on costs. So we continue that low 20s margin expansion. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Dahl : So I had a question on the downstream businesses. So it's nice to see certainly good properties and you're referencing that you're in margin recovery mode. You took up the guide for this year. When I take a step back and look at kind of your legacy business combined with the previous U.S. Concrete legacy business, it seems like there will be still like quite a bit more work or runway left on what \"normal\" to be in downstream. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that in terms of timing. Should we be thinking about that, your combined businesses could be like $400 million to $295 million. I'm not saying this year or next, but is that the right normal to be thinking about, or how should we frame that? Tom Hill : Yes. I think we were very encouraged that this quarter, we had unit margin growth in all 3 product lines. We battled out a little bit in Asphalt for a year or 2. And then we had to catch up. We said we'd catch up this year in Concrete, and we've got it in the second quarter. I'll take the product lines kind of one at a time, really strong quarter for Asphalt. Gross margins were up -- were at $66 million. They were $26 million last year. Volumes were up 16% in spite of wet weather in Texas, California and Arizona Asphalt volumes were really strong after a tough first quarter because of rain. Prices were up 9%, and our liquid costs were down. So great quarter in Asphalt. We told you guys we would continue to grow this margin than we are. So really encouraged by that. And that will only get better as you see the funding from IIJA and local and state, plenty of go to work in the public sector. Ready-mix, we had a really tough first quarter, slow start to the year. We got really blowing up with weather. We covered -- I thought the team there did a really nice job, recovering rapidly in the second quarter, and it was really driven by unit margin expansion. So on a same-store basis, our volumes were down actually 11%. A combination of rain in Texas and the impact of single-family demand. Prices were up 10% and unit margins were up 24%. So -- we said we'd get back to growth mode and ready mix. I think we are, and I think we'll continue that recovery. But I'm really proud of the ready-mixed teams recovery and the Asphalt team's continued performance in those product lines. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And Mike, just on a sort of longer-term horizon, I think in the ready-mix business, we still think that low double-digit gross margins is where we need to be. And so if you look -- we saw a great recovery in the second quarter. If you look at where we are in the trailing 12. As you said, we still have runway ahead of us, and that's the margin expansion that we're looking forward to going forward. And similarly, in the Asphalt business, we've sort of long said high single digit, maybe low double-digit, long-term gross margins in Asphalt. We've hit 10% on a trailing 12-month basis. And I think with where we are right now with the pricing environment and the demand environment ahead of us, we can still see some expansion there as well, but would still think of high single digit, low double digit over the long term. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Just following up on margins. I think you previously pointed to cash cost up high single digits year-over-year this year. I'm just wondering, is that still a fair expectation? And I think costs were up a little bit more than that in 2Q. You talked about comps getting easier in the second half. Just any kind of further detail in terms of the cadence from 3Q to 4Q? And if there's any sort of good guys or bad guys from a cost perspective that we should especially keep in mind for the second half? Tom Hill : Yes. We're getting better costs, but they're still high. They were up 9% in the quarter. And you really feeling the impact of the inflationary pressures on parts and services. As we said, comps get easier throughout the year, our guidance is the high single, which would put us in kind of mid for the balance of the year. Parts and service costs continue to plague as well. So we have issue of challenges with parts delivery, which hurts our efficiencies. That also is getting better. I think we do have a good guy in the quarter of diesel, which was probably an impact of around $25 million. And our operating efficiencies continue to improve and will help us offset some of this. So we guide you to -- for the full year to high single digit, which would put us kind of mid in the back half of the year, but we're comping over a lot easier numbers. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And Anthony, I think most important is it has been a challenging couple of years with inflationary pressure, certainly, but Aggregates is a price/cost winner, and our gross margin on a trailing 12-month basis, returning to expansion in the second quarter, what was great to see. We've got a good runway ahead of us on that. And as Tom highlighted earlier, still expect low 20% growth this year in our cash gross profit per ton. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's very helpful. And maybe just on labor, are you seeing any change there, maybe not in terms of wage rate or dollar, but in terms of availability of labor that's maybe helping you or hurting you this year? Tom Hill : It's still tight. I think it is. The labor market has gotten better from our perspective. I think we've also gotten better retention and how we handle that. So still a challenge, but much improved from where it was over the last couple of years. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Tom and Andrews, I wonder if you just talk about how you're thinking about pricing for '24, it feels like one of the big lessons learned for the industry from '22 is the price for a higher level of inflation and inflation is lower, just get the benefits of that. How are you thinking about the magnitude of those January 1 price increase comp that you spoke about versus the historical 4% to 5% CAGR that you and the industry have delivered given the backdrop that we've seen over the past 18 months. Tom Hill : So as I said, I think we've got a lot of momentum going with this, and this -- the private side demand on this being better is helping that. Everybody's got good visibility to the public side, I think that if you go out there and talk to the segment to the Construction Materials and Construction segment, people are feeling a lot better about the future than maybe we were 6 months ago. And you can see more of the demand. So that positive sentiment, the momentum on pricing and better visibility to demand, all a good setup for price. As far as magnitude, we're working on that right now, but I would -- our strategy last year was to go out higher on January 1. I thought that worked very well. And I think I wouldn't see a stream from that strategy as we look to 2024. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : So I'm a little unclear on the CapEx. So I think CapEx is expected to be $600 million, $650 million, but does that include the $200 million in land purchases? Or will that be on top of it? Maybe I'm missing it, but those maybe flow on the acquisition line on the cash flow statement. I'm just not sure. And then just, Tom, any color on the M&A pipeline? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. So Tyler, to clarify, the $200 million that we're planning to spend on strategic reserves is in addition to the $600 million to $650 million. It will show up as PP&E as it is land. But I think you're thinking about it right in terms of it being more of an opportunistic strategic acquisition type opportunity. And I'll let Tom hit M&A. Tom Hill : Yes. I would simply describe the acquisition with the improving picture and clarity to the private demand and it probably looked a little better than maybe we thought. I would expect that to improve the M&A pipeline. We've got -- we always have a couple we're working on, but strategic bolt-ons. But I would think this will help the pipeline. Operator : The next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : Wanted to follow up on the strategic cash uses. So talking about property purchases, is this because of opportunistic availability? Or is this a need to reach ore reserves, just some color there? And similarly, just wondered if you would comment on the first share buyback since the pandemic and what that might illustrate for your future plans. Tom Hill : I think we'll split that question. I'll take the land piece. You're exactly right. It is opportunistic. A lot of times, these are when they come up, much like a bolt-on acquisition, and that's both for buying reserves, but also both buying reserves and selling land are going to be lumpy by nature. You heard Mary Andrews, I think it was in '21, where we sold $180 million worth of land. So it is -- it comes when it comes, it's hard to plan. Sometimes you can, most of the time you can't. I would tell you, I'm very pleased with the reserves we got. They were primarily in California, Texas and North Carolina. So glad to give them good use of capital and pleased with the team's effort on that. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And in terms of share repurchases, returning excess cash to shareholders through repurchases has been part of our long-standing capital allocation priorities. We believe appropriately following reinvesting in the business, through operating and maintenance CapEx, after growing the business and returning cash through the dividend. So with attractive cash generation and slower M&A in the first half of the year. We repurchased $50 million of shares in the second quarter. And really, our capital allocation decisions in the back half of the year will just follow our same disciplined approach. Operator : The next question is from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Phil Ng : Congrats on the strong quarter. My question is your guidance for average volumes you're calling for it to be down, call it, 1% to 4%. And you want to down modestly in 2Q. And with housing bottoming and you're calling out pretty good momentum on the infrastructure and heavy commercial side with frankly easier comps in the back half, it feels kind of conservative. Any one-offs that we should be mindful of, and when we look out to 2024, time you're talking about how you're seeing momentum building on infrastructure and heavy on the industrial side. Any color on how to think about the growth profile in those 2 end markets when we kind of look at 2024? Tom Hill : Yes. I think if you look at the kind of the upside, downside to our guidance, the low side, the minus 4 would tell you that single-family shipments would have to fall off, of course, than we've seen. I think we bottom -- we're seeing kind of the bottom in single-family. And I think that it gets better for -- hopefully, we get better for 2024. On the high side, at minus 1, we'd have to see a little more volume. How we have -- some of our projects we have to start a little faster. It could happen, and that's why we got the range where we do. I do think that the heavy piece and he is going to help us in the second half. I think it's going to be more help in 2024 on the heavy industrial. Phil Ng : Is there a way to think about how that growth profile is going to look next year? I mean, low single digits for Infra. Is that like a mid- to high single-digit growth story next year? Tom Hill : On other infrastructure, you mean? Phil Ng : Just infrastructure in general, right? I mean, Tom, you talked about low single-digit growth this year, right? So when we look out to 2024 with all the lettings have been bidding actively flowing through, is that like a mid-single-digit growth or high single-digit growth? Tom Hill : I think it's too early to call. We just got to see more. I would address that we haven't talked about the non-highway infrastructure is also looking very good. Like highways, the local state and federal funding is extremely healthy, and that's IIJA in it. Starts and the other non-highway infrastructure were up in probably 6 months, it was up 18% and trailing 3 is up 20%. So good for '23, probably again low single digit but much better for '24. Operator : The next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Brian Biros : This is actually Brian Biros on for Kathryn. Just on the Asphalt business, can you just touch a little bit more on the performance there? Maybe the volume growth specifically, just kind of what projects are you seeing come to market in that business that it's more repair work, or maybe it's more new work coming down the pipeline? Tom Hill : It's -- as far as the paving is both. You're seeing both new and recovery. You do have -- I mean, and overlays I was pleased with the volume growth because we had a lot of rain in Texas, which is a big asphalt. Flip side of that is California and Arizona probably had some catch-up from the first quarter, which we just didn't do much at all. I am very pleased with the pricing performance and the unit margin performance. So I think a really good start to the year in Asphalt. We're back in unit margin growth mode and the growth in funding for highways is only going to help this product line. Operator : Next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Great quarter. Tom, I think you characterized the midyear price increases as mixed. What was that? I think there was hope a month or 2 ago, it might be better, and does that bode well for January increases next year? Tom Hill : Yes. Remember, as I said, the sequencing from '22 to '23 was very different. We intentionally went out much higher, much earlier in 2023. So kind of as expected, the midyear was successful in some markets. It was successful in some market segments. It will have a little bit of an impact on '23, but it's going to have a much larger impact on '24, and that's simply a matter of timing from timing from project pricing to shipment and also maybe some backlogs. It does impact 2024. I don't think it slows any momentum for January 1 price increases. Again, that strategy of higher early work is really good in '23, and we'll get that strategy towards '24. But -- so that's -- I would tell you that as expected. Operator : The next question is from Keith Hughes with Truist. Keith Hughes : Give us some update on the situation in Mexico and Macquarie there and to the process. Any sort of movement at all? Tom Hill : So the short answer is the same. No news. We've got the NAFTA claim. We'll have the final hearing on that -- on the NAFTA tribunal this year. We should have a result of that in 2024. We feel very good about our position. We feel very good about our case. We feel very good about the evidence, but we won't have -- we'll finish the legal proceedings this year and have a final ruling in '24. Keith Hughes : And what would be the best case scenario if you're successful in that? Tom Hill : I think that we get a large check and because of the shutdown of our business. The magnitude of that, we can't disclose because we have a confidential agreement with the tribune. Operator : Next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Tom, nice quarter. I wanted to maybe just ask a little bit on the guidance and you talked about the third quarter being in California, Texas in the second quarter. What's your sort of best estimate of the carryforward tons into the second half due to the disruptive first half weather? Tom Hill : I think you saw that in California, Arizona in the quarter. You probably will have some of that in the third quarter in Texas. As I said earlier, what I'm impressed with is we're seeing a lot of speedy recovery after wet days in our markets, which tells me that our -- the firepower of our contractors is getting much better. And I'm sure it is because of the work that they got coming out from all the public funding. So I think maybe a little bit in Texas. Everybody else, I think you don't see a lot of carryforward because they've been able to catch up pretty quick. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Tom, as you provided some very helpful observations on expectations for the second half year in '24, but if you're going to isolate either better-than-expected pricing, better-than-expected cost and better-than-expected volume as we maybe exit the '23 into '24, what would you point towards or maybe all of the above? Tom Hill : You're saying if we go from '23 to '24? Michael Dudas : Yes, as we get through the second half of the year as results come through, your expectation would have been getting to year-end, like say, the high end of your EBITDA range or would it be better pricing, better cost utilization and execution or better volumes? Tom Hill : I would tell you we probably have the best shot at how we work coming on a little faster than maybe we expected is the flip side of that is obviously that if you see a bigger slowdown on -- some -- more slowdown on res, which at this point, we don't think is going to happen unless we'll take it one at a time. On pricing, I think we've got it about right, how we got it because we've got a little bit in the midyear, but it's going to flow through in '24. The cost piece, I think, again, we've got to be mid-single digits at the end of the year. And I think that between efficiencies and comps, we get there. I guess at the end of the day, if I had to pick one, I would probably pick the volume piece of that. Operator : The next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : Tom, nice to see the continued improvement in Aggregates gross margin this quarter. I guess my question was more to the quarter and thinking about this going forward. With the East under some pressure, due to weather and some of those variables, was that actually a net negative to your reported profitability in that segment? Tom Hill : I'm sorry, couldn't understand what you point out as possibly negative. Mary Andrews Carlisle : The East. We do have very attractive margins in our East Coast business. I think while there was some wet weather A lot of the strength in the private non-res and these large industrial projects in those areas. And so our volumes were quite healthy in those markets. Tom Hill : I also would tell you that I think the East -- I was impressed with we had wet weather in East, but the recovery time when those thunderstorms will flow through, the next couple of days was impressive. Operator : It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Tom for any additional closing remarks. Tom Hill : Well, thank you all for your interest and your time and your support of Vulcan Materials Company. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter, and we hope that you and your families stay healthy and safe. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

My name is Angela, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] After the company's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Now, I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Mary Andrews Carlisle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our website, vulcanmaterials.com. Please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation, and other SEC filings. During the Q&A, we ask that you limit your participation to one question. This will allow us to accommodate as many as possible during the time we have available. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining our call this morning. In September, we officially surpassed our prior goal of $9 per ton cash gross profit on a trailing 12-month basis, and that was before reaching the 230 million tons on a same-store basis and despite macro challenges over the past four years that none of us likely anticipated back in the fall of 2019 when we initially set that target. This accomplishment perfectly demonstrates the durability of our aggregates-led business, and I'm really proud of how our teams continue to execute at a high level. Compounding profitability through the solid execution of our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating Strategic Disciplines is at the core of who we are across our coast-to-coast footprint. Today, our teams are intensely focused on our new target of $11 to $12 of cash gross profit per ton. Cash gross profit per ton growth is key to increasing our free cash flow and continuing to create value for our shareholders. In the quarter, we generated $602 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is a 19% improvement over the prior year. Our aggregates, asphalt and concrete product lines all posted another quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. In the aggregates segment gross margin expanded by 200 basis points and cash gross profit per ton improved by 18% despite lower volumes. Shipments declined 2% in the quarter with variations across end uses and geographies. Residential weakness impacted the majority of our markets, while at the same time many of our markets are seeing improving momentum in highway shipments. Private non-residential construction activity related to large industrial and manufacturing projects continue to drive healthy volume growth, particularly in Georgia and the Carolinas. Remember, footprint matters in the aggregates business. Ours is unmatched in the Southeast, where private demand dynamics are currently strongest, and across the country in states where IIJA investments will be the most significant. Pricing momentum continued across our footprint, with all geographies achieving healthy year-over-year increases. Average selling prices improved 15% in the quarter and 3% sequentially, more than offsetting continued inflationary cost pressures. In asphalt, gross margin improved 660 basis points. Shipments increased 11% and across most geographies with particular strength in California. Average selling prices improved 2% and cash unit profitability improved over 50%, benefiting from lower liquid asphalt costs and solid manufacturing cost control. Concrete gross margins improved 120 basis points. Cash unit profitability improved by over 30%, despite lower volume that continued to be impacted by the slowdown in residential construction activity. Remember, prior year concrete segment earnings benefited from the contribution of the now divested New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania concrete operations. Through the first nine months of the year, we have executed well and successfully navigated evolving macro dynamics. Let me comment briefly on what we are currently seeing in each end use. Starting with residential, we are encouraged by the recent growth in single-family permits and starts in many geographies over the last three months. On the other hand, after providing some support for overall residential demand, multi-family starts have now begun to pull back from historically high levels. Affordability and higher mortgage rates are likely to continue to have some impact on residential activity, but the underlying fundamentals remain firmly in place. Vulcan markets have low housing inventory levels and favorable demographics, driving the need for additional housing. In private non-residential construction, trends differ across categories. As expected, warehouse activity, the largest non-res category, has softened, but manufacturing activity remains at high levels and is concentrated in Vulcan states. We have booked and are shipping on numerous large manufacturing projects where we offer customers a differentiated solution with our advantaged footprint and logistics capabilities. On the public side, leading indicators remain supportive of continued growth in both highway and infrastructure. Trailing 12-month highway starts are up 18% and 2024 state budgets are at record levels. We continue to expect accelerating growth in public construction activity into next year and continued growth for the next several years. Our nimble sales and operating teams are well prepared to deliver value for our customers in any demand environment and to continue to improve unit profitability and drive value for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our third quarter performance and upgraded 2023 outlook. Mary Andrews? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Over the last 12 months, we have improved our adjusted EBITDA margin by 220 basis points, posted a 97% free cash flow conversion ratio before our strategic reserve purchases, returned $275 million to shareholders via dividends and repurchases, improved our return on invested capital by 180 basis points, and reduced our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage to 1.8 times. Our robust operational performance that Tom highlighted, coupled with our sound capital allocation and strong balance sheet, position us well for continued success on our strategic objectives of further enhancing our core and expanding our reach. As part of our ongoing portfolio optimization, we are currently working to finalize an agreement for the disposition of our Texas concrete assets. As a result, during the quarter, we classified these assets as held for sale and recorded a $28 million pretax charge to adjust the carrying value to fair value. During the first nine months, we have invested $411 million in maintenance and growth capital. We continue to expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million on maintenance and growth capital and $200 million on strategic reserve purchases for the full year. Year to date, our SAG expenses have increased a modest 3% and improved by 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Year-over-year increases are due mostly to higher incentive accruals congruent with improved earnings. Our investments in talent and technology to support our business objectives are paying off in operational results. After another quarter of strong operational execution and financial results, we now expect to achieve between $1.95 billion and $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023, a greater than 20% improvement versus the prior year at the midpoint. We plan on carrying this strong momentum into next year. So I'll now turn the call back over to Tom to provide some initial commentary on 2024 and a few closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews. While we are still finalizing our operating plans for 2024, let me offer some early commentary on our expectations, and I'll start with the two things I'm most confident in regarding 2024. First, aggregates pricing momentum. For the last seven quarters, aggregate prices have exceeded historical norms, and the price environment remains quite positive. Our Vulcan Way of Selling is driving our commercial execution. We expect prices to improve at least high single-digit in 2024. Second, public demand. We are confident in growing public demand, supported by the recent growth in contract award activity and healthy state DOT budgets for 2024. We expect public construction activity to accelerate next year. Now, there's more uncertainty regarding the impact of the microeconomic environment on private demand that makes it, frankly, a little bit or too early to call. While current trends in single-family residential activity are positive, uncertainty remains as to how higher rates and affordability challenges may impact that sector overall and influence whether or not it returns to growth next year. In private non-residential demand, similar uncertainties exist as to how a higher rate environment could impact the sector overall. Additionally, if warehouse activity continues to pull back from the recent historical high levels, it may further mask the current strength in manufacturing activity and will be a key driver of the decline - the degree of decline in non-residential demand. We'll give you an update in February as to how we see these dynamics unfolding and what that means for aggregate shipments in 2024. I am confident that our teams are well equipped to deliver unit profitability growth in any macro environment, and they have a proven track record of doing so. Over the last 12 months, even in the face of a volatile macro backdrop and lower aggregate shipments, our aggregates cash gross profit per ton has expanded by 18% and our adjusted EBITDA has improved 17%. As we work to finish this year strong and finalize our plans for 2024 over the next couple of months, we remain focused on keeping our people safe, stay committed to our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating Disciplines and continue to deliver value for our shareholders. And now, Mary Andrews and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please go ahead. Trey Grooms : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So Tom, I wanted to kind of follow up on the last bit of your commentary here. And I appreciate some of your high-level comments around demand and the end markets. But could you maybe give us enough color where we could try to triangulate maybe the possibilities, if it is possible to call at this point, of if volume could be in positive territory next year as you kind of look at those three or four end markets and understanding there's a lot of uncertainty here? But any additional color you could give us around that would be helpful. Tom Hill : Yes. Trey, good morning. Probably a little early to call specifics. I'd say that footprint is going to matter, and I like ours because of the position in the Southeast, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw a modest decline next year similar to what we've seen this year, but we get there a different way. Some challenges on the private side. Single-family we think has hit bottom and is improving. And I think we can get to growth when looking at the full year for 2024. Multi-family, as you know, will be a headwind. So in non-res, I think we've got some - it's a mixed bag. We've got some challenges on the light side and our warehouses. Warehouse starts have gotten a little weaker. The headwinds in light warehouses will be partially offset, I think, by the big industrial projects, which really fit us now. Now, we'll - you'll definitely see growth on the private side, both in highways and non-highway infrastructure, driven by state, local and the big IIJA funding. All that said, to your point, I think I could make a scenario to get flat volume next year, but at this point, I'd probably lead us to a modest decline. But that all that being said, remember that similar to this year, we should still realize really strong earnings growth next year, even if we do have a modest decline in volume. Trey Grooms : Got it. Okay. Thanks for those thoughts, Tom. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on. Tom Hill : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hi. Good morning. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Hi, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hi. Good morning. Hi, I know there's obviously going to be a lot of chatter about volumes, but I kind of want to come back to this idea about unit revenues versus unit costs, because it feels like costs are just remaining stubbornly sticky. Volumes are stubbornly opaque. So despite both of those, though, you guys have expanded unit margins. So can you just talk about your confidence in the durability of expanding those margins into next year, kind of regardless of what the market throws at you? And Mary Andrews, just any thoughts on what unit cost inflation ex-fuel could? Thanks. Tom Hill : Yes. Let me take - I think I'll take price first. And you are right, we'll expand margins, and I think we'll see another year of really strong unit margin growth even in the face of inflation. And it's really because we carry really good pricing momentum into 2024. That visibility into healthy public demand growth and you couple that with rising energy prices really sets up a good environment for price. Our conversations with our customers for January price increases, I think, have gone very well. If you look at our backlog prices, I think they are very healthy. And as we look at 2024 prices, I'd expect at least high single digit, but I could also see a path to low double-digit pricing. So at this point, we carry really good - we carry excellent pricing momentum into 2024, and we'll more than offset inflation and see strong unit margin growth. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. Tyler, and in terms of cost and evaluating next year, I think it's probably helpful to think about our recent trends on a trailing 12-month basis. You'll remember on a year-over-year basis, trailing 12-month, total cost, cash cost to sales, began rising in the first quarter last year. And we saw it ramp considerably that delta for five quarters before peaking in the first quarter of this year. It's since moderated for the last two quarters modestly. And we expect that trend to continue. We just think it's going to be gradual. So as we think into next year, I think what that means is higher than historical average cost increases in 2024, possibly even high single digits. But as you started with the pricing momentum that Tom described, we can still deliver attractive gross margin improvement and, definitely, unit profitability improvement next year. Tyler Brown : Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Hi, Garik. Garik Shmois : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for having me. I was wondering if you can expand on just that last comment, Tom, with respect to seeing a path to low double-digit pricing next year, recognizing you don't have a formal guidance just yet and you do expect pricing to be at least high single digits. Is that based on the conversations that you guys are having now with the customers and perhaps better-than-expected discussions? Does it require carryover from any mid-year increases you got this year? Or does it require any additional mid-year pricing next year? Just any additional color on how we get to low double digits in 2024? Tom Hill : Yes. On price, first of all, I would say that it's high single digit, low double digit. The January price increases conversations gone very well. And as you pointed out, I think as we've seen for the last few years, we'll have mid-year price increase discussions with our customers. It's just part of the norm now. We'll - well, I guess we'll check back in in February with a little more color on that and have a lot clearer view of it. But again, I think as we look forward, it looks pretty good from a price perspective. On cost, as Mary Andrews said, it's - the place is just stubborn for us. And where we've looked past, had low single digit each year. This year - up until 2022, this year, we're at low double digit. But as Mary Andrews says, starting to fall off, but it's - I think it's slower than maybe I would have expected six months ago. Garik Shmois : Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Hi, Anthony. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : Hi. Good morning. Tom, on private non-residential, you talked about some of these large manufacturing projects in the Southeast helping to offset weakness in some of the lighter categories. And I'm just wondering, as you look over the past few months and as we think about '24, have you seen any kind of incremental slowdown or delays in some of these megaprojects? Or are they coming kind of on time or maybe faster than expected? I guess, we've seen some new stories about maybe availability of skilled labor and contractors in some cases impacting individual projects. But I don't know if that was something that was widespread or something that you're seeing with your customer set. Tom Hill : Actually, I think just the opposite. We've seen them come on strong. At this point, I think we booked 11 of those very large projects and starting to ship those. It'll be more of a 2024 play. Those 11 that I'm thinking of make up about 12 million tons. As we look out, I think we are - probably over the next year, we'll bid another six, seven, eight of these big projects that would constitute another 14 million tons. So the large industrials are going to move the needle for us in 2024. Geography really helps here. There's Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, where a lot of those are right in our footprint. So our geography has really helped us here. But from our perspective, they've gone probably a little faster than maybe we have anticipated. So - but remember, we are first coming out of the ground, so supply chain probably impacts us less than maybe others does. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Hi, Stanley. Stanley Elliott : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for the question. Hi, Tom, could you talk a little bit more about kind of what you're seeing at the state budget level? It seems to be kind of a different part of the story maybe from prior years. And just how that can help the public markets accelerate into next year? Tom Hill : Yes. Good question. And actually, it's going well. As you know, we always say it takes two years for the money to go to work. And if you remember, IIJA was past November of '21. So we are at a two-year mark, and we are starting to see it come on. It'll be a gradual growth rate over time. We will see growth in 2024. We see it in the awards. Trailing 12 months is up 17% on awards. But if you look at the - to your point, if you look at the state DOT capital budgets for 2024, they're actually really big. You probably won't see all of that in '24, but it'll sure sets us up well. For example, I think Alabama is up 29% capital budget. California is up 5%, but 50% over three years in California. So we are starting to see that money flow through. Florida will be up 20%. Tennessee's budget doubles. And Texas is up 21%. So this will be a multi-year play. They can't put all that money to work in 2024, but sure sets us up. Some of it will go to work in '24, but it sets us up also for '24 and '25. I think that, again, all this is really setting us up well for '24, '25 and '26. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. Thanks so much. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning, Kathryn. Kathryn Thompson : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question today. I know there's a lot of questions just about the rest of '23 and the outlook for 2024. But stepping back and looking at the big picture, there's been a bit of activity in the industry from an M&A standpoint and some rumblings of greater slowdown in the economy in 2024, which can be opportunities for growth for companies well as positioned as yourself. As you think about these type of opportunities and just areas of growth for Vulcan, how do you position yourself and what geographies and/or products are at top of the list in terms of growth initiatives for Vulcan? Thank you. Tom Hill : Yes. Well, aggregates is always going to be the top of the list, and bolt-ons in our footprint will give us the best returns. As I look at the M&A market right now, from, say, six or eight months ago, it's actually picked up. I think over the next several months, over the next several quarters, we should see some strategic bolt-on acquisitions. And I think that we've got some really good opportunities there. I think we'll also, over the next two years, see a marked pickup in greenfield starts as we got some really good opportunities in adjacent markets to add some new facilities that we've been working on for the last five to 10 years. So I think both will pick up. As always, our biggest growth engine is going to be improving cash gross profit per ton in aggregates. And I think, as we've heard earlier in this conversation, while we've had a great year in '23, I think we'll also have a really strong year because of pricing momentum and our operating disciplines as we look out to 2024. So I'm very encouraged with growth on all fronts at this point. Kathryn Thompson : Okay. Great. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Morning, Jerry. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Morning. Jerry Revich : Hi, Tom, Mary Andrews. Good morning. I'm wondering if we could just talk about the opportunity that you folks have from the logistics services and other initiatives outside of price cost. You've had, over the past 10 years, 10% compounded CAGR and profitability. You've had some contribution outside of price cost from those initiatives. And can we just ask you for an update on how that's tracking and the opportunity set over the next couple of years? Tom Hill : Yes. That's - it's quietly gone very well for us, and that's been, I think, a strategic advantage of servicing our customers, particularly on these very large projects. They're complex. They are all - quality and delivery makes a big difference, because those projects have a time frame and some of them have damages, if you're not on time and if you can't get it there and get the right product there to hold the project up, it's worth more than the price of aggregates. So I think that, both from a price perspective and a volume perspective, quietly has been a strategic advantage for us. Jerry Revich : And the outlook from here, Tom? Any particular acceleration, because it seems like it's contributed to the unit profitability CAGR about 1 points to 2 points generally? Tom Hill : Yes. I think that it will continue to grow. I think we continue to add new features to that, including back office features that make it easier for our customers to do business with us. So I think, again, we're not done with it and we continue to learn and improve upon it. Jerry Revich : Thanks. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Morning, Mike. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Morning. Mike Dahl : Morning. Thanks for taking my question. We talked about the downstream businesses, maybe give us an update on how you're thinking about them for this year within the guide and then if you do have any initial thoughts on kind of the volume and price or price cost outlook, similar to how you outlined for aggregates for your downstream businesses next year, that would be great. Tom Hill : Yes. So asphalt, it's been a great year. It was a really strong quarter. Volumes were up 11%, margins up 50%. And we really helped - first of all, we are in really good asphalt markets, but we're also obviously helped by liquid - fall in liquid and, on top of that, really good pricing momentum for hot mix. As we look to 2024, I'd say we are still doing the work. I think there's potentially some challenges from liquid pricing going up. I think demand will be okay, but I think we'll give you a lot more color in February. As I looked at ready-mix, as we called out kind of early in the year, where we struggled with unit margins because of inflation and energy last year, we got past that with price as we predicted. Volumes in the quarter were a little challenged on a same-store basis, and that's really driven by single-family construction. But prices were up 10% and unit margins were up over 30%. Next year, I think it's a little early to call, because of the volatility in the private side. We just got to see more. That said, I think we do have pretty good pricing momentum going into '24 on concrete. Mary Andrews Carlisle : And I think just longer term, we think about that ready-mix business as kind of low double-digit gross margin. And I think as we move ahead, we'll continue improving back towards that. On asphalt, same thing probably through the cycle, high single digits, maybe low double digits. We're ahead of that right now, because of timing on energy, but the margin recovery in both businesses is exciting, and we'd expect that to continue. Mike Dahl : Great. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning, Timna. Timna Tanners : Morning, guys. Thanks for all the great detail. I guess, I know I asked yet, I figured I'd touch on the Mexican quarry updates, because there was some news recently that the government offered you something north of $300 million, and that was not accepted. So just wondering what the latest there is, what you're holding out for. I know you've quoted some press reports of closer to over $1 billion, but just trying to get a sense of maybe any timing there or the latest in that process. Thanks. Tom Hill : Yes. As far as - you got to remember, as far as a number is concerned, we have a confidentiality agreement with the NAFTA tribunal. So we can't quote numbers. There's been some quoted in the Mexican press. As far as the business value of that business is concerned, the simple story is that we're waiting for the results of the NAFTA claim. The NAFTA tribunal heard the case in August. We like our position. We like how that hearing went. We should get those results sometime next year. And as far as the property rights and our property down there, we'll protect our ownership - we'll simply protect our ownership of our land in Mexico. Timna Tanners : So them offering you something before the results of the NAFTA panel was just, what, to try to get around that ultimate result maybe? That seems strange. Tom Hill : I can't - I don't want to predict the dealings of the Mexican government. I can't explain that to you. Timna Tanners : Understood. All right. Thanks again. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Hi, Phil. Philip Ng : Hi, guys. You guys called out some cross currents in your non-res business, notably between manufacturing and warehouse. Can you help size up these two end markets for you from a percentage of your business or tons? And any nuances between the aggregates intensity of these two different end markets? Tom Hill : Yes. Well, I would tell you, first of all, both of them are really aggregate intensive because they're big and they're flat. But let me just kind of see if I can size up the non-res sector for you. I think, first of all, non-residential demand has been much better in '23 than we originally anticipated back in February, really supported by warehouses and the large manufacturing projects. As we look to '24, I think non-residential construction demand will have some segments up and some segments down. The larger manufacturing projects, which you pointed out, are really good for aggregates and particularly good for Vulcan. As I pointed out, so many of those are right in our footprint, and we are - we've already backlogged almost a dozen of them. So we'll service a little bit of that this year, but most of it will go into '24. Warehousing demand held up really good in '23. It's at record levels, but we see some risk as starts are now slowing, as we had anticipated. We thought we'd get hit with some of that at '23, but so far so good. But I think we're probably anticipating some of that for '24. We'll continue to see some challenges to light because of macroeconomics. But even with some challenges to non-res, I think our markets outperform because of the big, large industrials and how many have we backlogged. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And Phil, in terms of composition of shipments, we don't necessarily track shipments to that level. But I think you could think about it in terms of contract awards. And so in private non-res, warehouses now make up probably close to 50% of the contract awards; and the industrial manufacturing, probably 10% to 15%. Philip Ng : Okay. And then you guys gave us some good color for 2024 in terms of the big drivers, low single-digit volume declines potentially in aggs, double-digit price, and then potentially high single-digit cost inflation. Mary Andrews, I guess if I had to unpack that, I get to low-teen cash gross profit per ton growth next year. Am I generally in the strike zone? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Well, I think it's just too early for us to give you - to go there, really. We'll come back in February with more specifics. But as we've talked about, we definitely see good opportunities for continued unit profitability growth next year. Tom Hill : Yes. I think, overall, your assumptions are - again, we got - some of that could fluctuate by the time we get to February. But at this point, I don't think your assumptions are way off. Philip Ng : Okay. Thanks, Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist. Please go ahead. Keith Hughes : Yes. A question on diesel. What role is that playing in the guidance for the fourth quarter? And at current prices, what would that look like to start next year? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. So in the quarter - in the third quarter, diesel was really up and down, but was a net benefit. Thinking as we move forward, if diesel stays at the levels we saw in September, fourth quarter would probably be essentially a push. Looking into next year, we think on average, diesel will be higher year over year, but it's probably too early to call exactly what that will look like. As you know, for us, diesel can be a temporary challenge, but it's also an opportunity. Keith Hughes : And while we're on cost, one other question, I know a lot of your other inputs, components in this kind of the world has been continued to stay high. Will - are you hearing from your suppliers more potential increases to begin calendar '24? Tom Hill : Yes. I think everything is sequentially staying up. We are in those negotiations. I think a little early to call that right now from - for the big movers. The one we think will be up will be energy. Both diesel and electricity will probably be up. But as far as the other inputs, I think that it's stayed a lot more stubborn than we would anticipated. I don't think we are - at this point, we call up probably high single for next year, but it's really too early to call as we're doing the operating plans and the negotiations with our suppliers at this point. Keith Hughes : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Morning, Mike. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Mary Andrews. Mark and Tom. For Tom and Mary Andrews, when you talked about you allocated capital towards the land acquisitions here this quarter, up to $200 million, you talked about 2023. Maybe you can share like how that progress is and what's the medium-, longer-term timing on some of the greenfield opportunities? Are there some that are closer rather than others? And on a big picture basis, how much is that kind of, if you think about, relative to investing the capital into those types of projects? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. So this year, those strategic reserve purchases, as you would have seen, we completed the majority of that in the third quarter. And we are working on our capital planning for next year right now. And Tom mentioned earlier, we do have a healthy pipeline of greenfield opportunities at varying stages. So we are working now to define what that spending will look like for 2024. I think if you think of capex overall as we go into next year, we think that the current levels for operating and maintenance capex are appropriate for our current business needs and kind of where we are in the cycle. The growth is the part that will move around a little bit more, but we wouldn't expect the same level of land purchases next year as this year. Michael Dudas : Okay. And you would add - so there's capacity growth potential in those states or others as you're looking out medium to longer term as those markets continue to be attractive for you guys... Tom Hill : Yes. I think the answer is that yes. It's also - what you're looking at is where are the growth quarters and how do you get the most effective logistic position to those future growth quarters and what's the timing of putting the capital in. And that's the beauty of a greenfield is you can time the capital and you can - you don't have to go in all at once. So if you've got a faster growing market where your greenfield is, you'd put a big plan in. And if you got - if it's out there and you just want - in a slow growth, you'd put maybe a portable or smaller plan in. But I think that in a number of these, it is getting the most strategic position in those markets at the right time. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Mary Andrews, Tom. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Tom Hill : Morning, David. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Morning. David MacGregor : Good morning, Tom. Good morning, Mary Andrews. I guess my question is just on the timing on project starts. And I guess, are you seeing much in terms of change in the lag between awards announcements and aggregate shipments? I mean, is that lag greater than you would have otherwise expected at this point? And we've had quite a bit of inflation, obviously, in materials and labor and services. And I'm guessing a number of these projects are running above engineers' estimates. Any projects being held back or delayed as a consequence of inflationary concerns and expectations that, if they were to defer, they might get better economics further down the road? Tom Hill : As far as delay - as far as people - projects getting pushed back, we saw a little bit of that in a couple of states I'd say nine months ago. We're not seeing that today at all. In fact, states are working hard to get projects out. Inflation has definitely had an impact on project costs, but we are still seeing growth in demand this year and we'll see growth in demand next year despite inflation. And as you heard me talk about earlier, budgets are up in a number of states, what I'd say, dramatically. So I think they understand that. I don't think I worry about projects being pushed back from a cost perspective. If it is delays to projects, it's really delays to getting into lettings because of capacity of DOTs growing into the funding. But again, I think all that taken in. We continue to see gradual growth in highway demand next year and the next year and the next year and the next year. David MacGregor : Are you seeing much in the way of revisions to engineers' estimates? Tom Hill : I'm sorry. I misunderstood you. David MacGregor : Are you seeing much in the way of revisions to engineers' estimates? Tom Hill : Yes. They're going up, and I think they're adjusting to it appropriately. But there's a lag there and they're playing a little bit of catch-up because of inflation. David MacGregor : Thank you, Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Morning. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Michael Feniger : Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You gave some great color on 2024. Just to kind of put a finer point on it, when we think of the price versus cost spread you guys achieved in Q3, is that price versus cost spread expanding in 2024 or staying the same, given kind of the moving pieces you were indicating earlier? Tom Hill : I think the simple answer is, and you're not going to like, it was a little early to call. We're still figuring that out. We're trying to give you color very early on price and cost. And I think on price, we said high single digit, maybe in the low double digit on cost, really early on cost because we're estimating high single digit, but we're doing the work right now including negotiating with our vendors and doing the operating plans. I think what I am encouraged about on the cost perspective is I think we'll see improved operating efficiencies because of the automation in the - what we've done in the plants, but also the complete program of the Vulcan Way of Operating. But to call that margin growth at this point, I think we're just a little bit early. We'll be back to you in February. Michael Feniger : Appreciate that. And when we think of next year, how you kind of outlined potential movement in shipments when we think of the cadence to residential, public, light versus heavy? I'm just curious if you kind of help us understand how you think the cadence kind of plays out for next year. Is it - do you start strong? Or does it actually kind of get better through the year? You have kind of easier comps potentially in the second half. Just how we kind of think of these moving pieces, how that rolls through next year? Tom Hill : I don't know that I have - we've got that down yet. I think the puts and takes for next year go like this. And this is - and I'm not answering questions as far as sequencing to quarterly, but more what would be on the high side and what would drive us lower. And I think, number one, speed of - and really important, speed of how the dollars going to work and going to shipments will be at the forefront. Second would be, does single-family come roaring back or is it maybe a little slower? I hopefully think we'll see growth in single family. It's how fast and how far. And the macroeconomic - the macro - the demand - the fundamentals for demand in single-families there. But you're fighting, obviously, cost and inflationary pressures and the price of a house. On non res, it will be the speed of the big projects versus what happens with warehouses. So I think that those are kind of the puts and takes. I'm not sure that as far as the sequencing quarter to quarter, I think we got to do some work on that. But those will be the puts and takes of if we have the high end, the low end when we get to guidance in February. Michael Feniger : Perfect. Thank you. Tom Hill : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Rohit Seth with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. Rohit Seth : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Tom Hill : Hi, Rohit. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Morning. Rohit Seth : Good morning. My question is on the Vulcan Way of Operating. You guys had mentioned on past calls that you had made some investments over the past couple of years. I know you touched on the logistics side, but I think there's some plant-level stuff that you had in the works and we're looking forward to potentially being needle movers in 2024. Do you still think those are going to be needle movers next year? And if you can help us think about what to expect and if you can quantify any impact, that'd be great. Tom Hill : Yes. It's really hard to quantify, particularly at this point, as those operating plans are being developed and will be presented to us in December. From a high level, we - the investment we did and the top probably 70% of our operating facilities or tons from a volume perspective, that investment is in place. Now, once you get it in place, you've got to get the technical piece for each plant has to come out. We're working on that as we speak. I think we'll be through that by the time we get to the first, second quarter of next year or at least mid-year next year. So we'll see some marked improvements, I believe, in operating efficiencies, putting that to dollars and cents. That work is going on right now, and we won't be done with it until December. So we'll have to get back with you in February. Rohit Seth : All right. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Please keep yourselves and your families safe and healthy. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for your interest in Vulcan Materials company. Our teams delivered an outstanding year in 2023 and achieved two significant milestones. We generated over $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and we surpassed $9 of aggregate cash gross profit per ton. We remained focused on continued growth, consistent execution and value creation for our shoulders.  Our fourth quarter results again demonstrated the benefits of that focus and our aggregates-led business. We delivered a 27% year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Margin expansion in each of our three primary product lines and another 90 basis points of sequential improvement in our trailing 12 months return on invested capital.  In the Aggregates segment continued pricing momentum coupled with moderating inflationary costs resulted in $9.92 of aggregate cash gross profit per ton, a 21% improvement over prior year. Our Vulcan Way of Selling evoke we have operating disciplines continued to contribute to our commercial and operational results. The fourth quarter performance marks 19 of 20 quarters over the past five years of sequential improvement in trailing 12 month aggregate unit profitability. A clear example of our consistent execution and the durability of our business. Aggregate shipments in the fourth quarter increased 2%, compared to a week prior year quarter that was impacted by abnormal wet and cold weather. Aggregates freight adjusted price improved 14% in the quarter, pushing the year-to-date average selling price to $19 per ton, $2.60 per ton increase over the prior year.  Freight-adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter. This Marked a third consecutive quarter of trailing 12 month deceleration in year-over-year cost. As we move into 2024, we are determined to continue controlling what we can control most notably the expansion of our aggregates unit profitability. Price momentum remains healthy and we expect freight-adjusted aggregate price to grow from 10% to 12% for the full year. Inflationary cost pressures continue to moderate and we expect freight-adjusted unit cash cost to increase mid-single-digit in 2024 resulting in an attractive mid-teens improvement and cash gross profit per ton. On the demand side, we continue to expect a moderate decline in 2024 with aggregate shipments forecasted land within a range of flat to down 4% for the full year. Much like 2023, we see varying dynamics across different end uses. So let me provide some commentary on each end use. I'll start with residential, which has quickly entered recovery mode single-family housing permits and starts return to growth in the second half of last year and momentum is accelerating across our footprint. We expect the strength in single-family construction activity be offset by weaker multifamily starts as they pull back from historically high levels.  Overall, the underlying fundamentals for residential construction activity remained firmly in place. Vulcan markets have low housing inventory levels and favorable demographics driving the need for additional housing. We continue to see distinct trends across various categories of private non-residential construction, which we anticipate will result in a year-over-year decline in shipments to this end market. Moderating Warehouse starts from recent historical high levels are expected to be biggest headwind to private non-residential construction. Light commercial activity is expect to remain weak as uncertainty in the macro economy and higher interest rates persist. Manufacturing activity however remains a catalyst for non-residential shipments and is concentrated in Vulcan States. We continue to ship on numerous large manufacturing projects, which we offer customers a differentiated solution with our advantage footprint and logistics capabilities.  On the public side, the main backdrop is developing as expected. We began seeing modest growth in the second half of \u201823 and project accelerating demand into 2024. Trailing 12-month highway starts have now surpassed $100 billion. 2024 state budgets are at record levels and strong upcoming ladings are anticipated in many Vulcan States. We continue to see growth in both highways and infrastructure activities for the next several years. Coupling our anticipated unit profitability growth was the demand backdrop I just described at midpoint of our guidance we project delivering a fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA. I'm very proud of our teams what they have and will achieve.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our 2023 performance and some more details around our 2024 outlook. Andrews? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks, Tom and good morning. Our strong operational and strategic execution in 2023 set us up well to continue our long track record of growth through disciplined capital allocation and consistent execution. Over the last 10 years, we increased our revenues at an annual growth rate of 11%; grew our adjusted EBITDA at an annual growth rate of 16% percent; strengthened our free cash flow generation at an annual growth rate of 23%; and improved our return on invested capital by 1000 basis points. During 2023, we generated $1.5 billion of operating cash flows and received proceeds of over $700 million for the sales of non-core businesses and real estate. Having followed our long-standing capital allocation priorities of reinvesting in our franchise, investing in attractive growth opportunity and returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, we ended the year with over $900 million dollars of cash on hand and net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage of 1.5 times.  Our balance sheet is a source of strength and provides us considerable financial flexibility to continue to grow. We will remain disciplined in optimizing our overall portfolio of assets. As evidenced by the fourth quarter disposition of our Texas Concrete business and sale of excess real estate in Northern Virginia. Our return on invested capital improved by 280 basis points over the last 12 months and we are focused on continued improvement. We also remain focused on continuing to drive value for the business through disciplined investments and SAG expenses that support our organic growth initiatives and innovation through technology. SAG expenses as a percentage of revenue remained at 7% in 2023.  Overall, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 360 basis points and project further expansion in 2024. Let me provide a few additional details around the 2024 guidance to supplement the demand, pricing, and Aggregates unit profitability outlook Tom highlighted earlier. We expect our downstream businesses to contribute approximately $275 million in cash gross profit reflective of asphalt earnings consistent with 2023 contributing approximately 70% of the total and concrete earnings adjusted for the divestiture of our Texas Concrete assets contributing approximately 30% to total.  We expect SAG expenses between $550 million and $560 million, a modest low single-digit increase year-over-year. We project depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expenses of approximately $610 million, interest expense of approximately $155 million and an effective tax rate between 22% and 23%.  In 2024, we plan to reinvest in our franchise through operating and maintenance and internal growth capital expenditures of between $625 million and 675 million. We expect another year of attractive growth in adjusted EBITDA and strong cash generation in 2024, despite a shift in construction demand environment. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.15 billion and $2.3 billion for the full year. At the midpoint, this represent an 11% percent organic improvement over 2023.  I'll now turn the call back over to Tom to provide a few closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews. Vulcan\u2019s culture and people are fundamental to our Success. Our employees work tirelessly each day to deliver value to our customers, our communities and shareholders and their meaningful contributions were highlighted with three unsolicited recognitions last year. Vulcan Materials was named one of the top 200 best companies to work for by US News and World Report.  One of America's Most Responsible Companies in 2024 by Newsweek and was included in the American Opportunity Index, which measures how well large companies invest in the human talent to drive business performance and individual employee growth.  I'm excited about what Vulcan Materials will achieve in 2024. We will remain focused on keeping our people safe, growing our business, capitalizing on our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating Disciplines and continue to deliver value to our shoulders. Now Mary Andrews and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please go ahead. Trey Grooms : Good morning, Tom and Mary Andrews. Tom Hills : Good morning, Trey. Trey Grooms : Good morning. I was like you are looking for another year of double-digit growth ahead here for pricing. So, Tom, what\u2019s driving the confidence there as we move into 2024 on the pricing outlook? Tom Hills : Trey, I mean, we saw a fundamental change in our markets in 2022. We realized in March of 2022 that we had a worldwide inflation and so we took the lead in 2022 and pulled mid-year prices forward to May 1st that year in every market. And then followed that up with we pooled all the 2023 price increases to January 1 where some of it been April 1. So I think today the fundamentals for pricing is very, very good and I think embedded in those fundamentals are three crew changes that we are seeing in our markets. One, there is more disciplined in house price increases, two, our aggregates price increases are now January not April 1, and third, our mid-year price increase conversations are expected in all markets.  So we are in a really good place in pricing \u2013 price good place as we\u2019ve been historically and you couple that with the tools and disciplines of Vulcan with selling I think our future looks very good. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yeah, Trey, I\u2019ll just add that headline pricing is one thing but as we always like [Audio Gap] Operator : With Stifel. Please go ahead. Stanley Elliott : Hey good morning, everyone. And congratulation at the quarter and the in the outlook. Last question was a perfect lead-in. I was curious if you guys could talk a little bit more about kind of what you're seeing on the cost side? Maybe how does this mid-single digit sort of cost inflation that you're expecting in the coming year come together? Any puts and takes there would be great. Tom Hill : Thanks, Stanley. You saw it you saw the cost and the fourth quarter was up 7% and that's down from what we've been seeing is low-double-digit in prior quarters. I think it was like the third quarter where it start to come down. So what we're seeing is the impact of inflation started to dampen. As we said, we thought we'd see this year in mid-single-digit range.  That said, I would expect this to go this way that cost is going to be highest year-over-year in Q1 and then tail off as we march through the year. That's due to two reasons. One using inflationary pressures, but two you're starting to see improving operating efficiencies from the Vulcan Way of Operation. So you couple of that together, I think we're starting to catch up on the kind of runaway costs we've seen for a couple of years and we will I think we'll see improvement as we as we go through the year. Stanley Elliott : Perfect. That's great. Thanks so much and best of luck. Tom Hill : Thank you. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Kathryn Thompson : Hi, thank you for taking my question today. Two part on the \u2013 just some more color on the volume guide bridge and what you're seeing from an end market perspective? And how you had it in prepared commentary, but maybe a little bit more color just in terms of growth rates by end market and in previous calls, you were able to give some quantification of what mega projects are of your total expected sales. Just a clarification on the earlier question on pricing. Is \u2013 does the pricing guidance - does that include the thought for mid-year price increases? Or is it just carry over from previous pricing actions? Or is it a combination of both? Thank you. Tom Hill : Yeah, I'll take the mid-year first. Well, there's not much in there for me mega price increases. Now we will or have announced mid-year price increases and started those conversations in April. So I'm not saying there's no - it's not in the plan, but we'll have \u2013 we\u2019ll, for sure have the conversations very little up to the plan. On volume, as we talked about in November, we're predicting a modest decline in demand for \u201824. We see strength on the public side and kind of a mix bag of strengths and weaknesses on the private side and I'll go through those. Highways, steady growth wins race and we will continue to see that ramp up and we feel good about it. Lots of funding there and start to be put to work. Non-highway infrastructure will see solid growth and non-res most sectors I think will be challenged that the traditional non-res warehouses distribution. And as we talked about that's partially offset in our footprint with the large industrial projects and I think we have some 10 of those and we can we talk about that later. But they're meaningful. While single-family, what we saw was challenged in \u201823, it'll be a strength for us in \u201824. It's back into growth mode and recovering rapidly. At the same time I think multifamily, as everybody knows will be challenged. So, as we said we call volumes flat to negative 4 now, January February where as everybody knows where both are either a freeze out or washout or both. So, we're seeing a slow start that being said it's still on January February. So, I think we feel very good about full year guidance. So, probably a modest decline in volumes for \u201924. That said we should still see healthy double-digit earnings growth. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yeah, Catherine, I'll give you a couple of other things to think about regarding Q1 volume that may be helpful context. Last February was seasonally adjusted the strongest single month of shipments we had in 2023 and the strongest February in at least the last 10 years and also this year, simply given the way the calendar falls we will have approximately 10% fewer shipping days in March, which clearly we all know is the most important month of the quarter. Now the good news there is that's just timing what we take those days back up in April, but from a Q1 perspective, it will be impactful. So, overall volumes will be challenged in the first quarter. Pricing will be strong and it should fall within our guidance range. And I would expect that paired with the probable volume impacts to cause I'd expect maybe mid-to-high-single-digit growth and cash gross profit per ton in the first quarter still with the very attractive mid-teens improvement for the full year. Kathryn Thompson : Thank you so much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Hey, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about capital allocation. And you we've seen a number of I guess very large deals in construction materials over the past few months. Just wondering if you talked about potential attractiveness of M&A and what the pipeline might look like from your perspective in 2024? Tom Hill : Yeah, sure. Anthony the balance sheet is really well positioned to fund all of our capital allocation priorities in 2024, particularly M&A growth. As we mentioned, we ended the year with over $900 million of cash and net leverage of one and a half times. So, we'll think about capital allocation in 2024, very consistently as we have in the past that there is a very attractive M&A pipeline and that's what we're focused on in terms of being able to deploy the capacity that we have and I\u2019ll let Tom, do you want to make any more comments on those pipelines? Tom Hill : Sure. Well, I think if I have to go back and look at it, ours is a three pronged strategy to growth and it's very effective and has provided us with double-digit revenues and EBITDA for the last three years and will again in 2024. Those three are number one, organic growth in what we are selling what we are operating which you see us do. And, we've been very consistent we were able to grow unit margins for consistently for five years. Second is as you talked about is M&A. I think M&A while it was pretty quiet in \u201823 with a lot of unknowns out there. I think you'll be very busy in 2024. And we expect us to bring some deals to the finish line. And then I would supplementing that M&A is Greenfield growth, which is picking up that we have a handful of those projects beginning this year. It will take a little bit of time to get through that and we'll get a little closer to it. We'll talk about some of those, but I feel really good about growth strategy and M&A I think would be a much bigger part of it in \u201824 than what we saw in \u201823. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Hey, Jerry. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Jerry Revich : Hi, Tom, Mary Andrews. Good morning. I want to ask you in the fourth quarter, your margin performance was really outstanding sequentially full point ahead of normal seasonality. So it looks like costs are already starting to come down for you folks. Can you just talk about what improved in the quarter? And is there an opportunity if some of those improvements continue for us to be at the lower end of the growth outlook that you outlined in the prepared remarks, Tom? Tom Hill : Well, I think what you're seeing is as I said early two things you are moderating inflationary pressures of the comparisons get a lot easier and I think we'll continue to see that. But also if you look at our operating parameters and you remember we put the automation and the insights of the technology including the top-100 plants over last year, you start to see those things go to work which helps us with throughput and throughput of critical sizes.  So, I think that as we march through 2024, I think our costs should improve sequentially as we go through the quarter now, we will whether it can have a hiccup on that or one two big outages can have a hit on that. But it\u2019s overall, I would expect our cost to continue to improve over the next four, five quarters. Jerry Revich : Excellent. Thank you. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning, Phil. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Philip Ng : Hey guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter. It sounds like Tom, last year your pricing philosophy I think was to go big to start the year on average pricing and take a more measured approach on mid-years. If I've heard you correctly, If I heard you correctly you're at least having a conversation on that year\u2019s ready. So just give a little color to how you're thinking about your approach and philosophy this year? And in a more moderating deflate inflationary environment do you think double-digit pricing is kind of a new norm going forward? Thanks. Tom Hill : Well, as I said, I think we're in a very, very good place from a pricing perspective based on the fundamentals that we're seeing and also the Vulcan Way of Selling those tools help us dramatically and did work. I think that we went we went early as we have and I think that will continue to January 1 which helps obviously helps. We think we were appropriate on our January 1 prices. We announced mid-years in a few markets already. I think over the next probably the next beginning - end of the quarter we will probably announce it mid years for the other markets, and obviously you spend April, May and June having those conversations, so that you're ready for July/August for mid-year price increase. So I think that what those - the fact that it's all in January and the fact that everybody expects to have conversations about mid-year price increases, I think is very important for our markets. Philip Ng : And then double-digit pricing there I like the new norm going forward? Tom Hill : I feel good about pricing. Philip Ng : Okay. All right. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Tom Hill : You bet. Operator : And we'll take our next call or our next question from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Yeah, thank you for taking my questions. Tom, to follow up on just the pricing can you just - the Cadence of pricing for this year you gave great color on the cadence of how you think cost plays out. Just on pricing, do you think about the end of the year? Are you still kind of in that 10% to 12% range? Are you below it because you start strong. Just kind of how we should think about that? Tom Hill : No, I think I think the pricing will be pretty consistent through the year in that 10 to 12 range. I don\u2019t see a big changes in that. Now you also got is - in the third quarter you got to see what happens with mid years. And we'll have that conversation after we get past July 1. I\u2019ll give you a lot more clarity because we\u2019ll just have a clear picture of it. And every market is going to be different that in their ways are. But I would call it pretty consistent low-double-digit pricing throughout the year. Michael Feniger : Great. And Tom just to follow-up, on you gave great color on kind of the volume, your shipment growth with the different segments. Just when we think of Upstate fast-forward to 2025 and obviously, we'll see how to 2024 plays out. But if you - in a similar range in 2025 with the volume kind of guidance, and it's underpinned by growth in infrastructure, can you just help us understand how that informs pricing relative to maybe if it's being driven by residential or private construction markets how - having it underpinned by infrastructure. So that's kind of maybe shifts the pricing conversations? Tom Hill : I will tell you that my philosophy is all demand growth are good things I don\u2019t see it where it comes from I like it. But the pricing between public and private, there's really not a big difference there. I think that the one thing I would call out, the good thing about public demand is it's very visible and it's for sure. I mean, on the private side people could hold projects or delay them, but you know public growth is going to go to work. It's not a matter if it to twin and so that visibility to growing demand on the public side is really good for pricing. But a ton of concrete rock for public or private is probably the same number. The difference is the public people know it's there. They know it\u2019s coming and they can take a risk on value and price. Operator : And we'll take our next question from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital markets. Please go ahead. Mike Dahl : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just back on kind of the M&A and capital allocation you raised some pretty healthy funds from the sale and in fact it seems like that was the last big chunk because that\u2019s from maybe California of the - US concrete asset. So I just wanted to have you elaborate a little more on kind of rationale behind making the move now. And then when you - as you think about the allocation, you mentioned M&A there's organic investments, I mean, in the obviously now have pretty healthy capital position. So, relative to that before but Ag specific pipeline and relative size of the deals that you think are potentially out that can cross the finish line this year. Anything you can provide there? Tom Hill : I would look at the M&A is more traditional bolt-on I think would show which is very much in our footprint. So it has highest returns and deal sizes everything from small and mid-range. Maybe a little better - big some a little bigger than mid-range, but I think that as far as the timing is concerned I think \u201823 was abnormally, I guess, quiet and it was because there was so much insecurity about what we're going to fall off the cliff is there going to be a recession and so when you have all those unknowns, people tend to slow down both buyers and sellers and I think the fact you got that behind you, you'll see some catch up in 2024. Mike Dahl : And rationale for exiting the ready mix assets? Tom Hill : Well, I think, if you look at our assets, we look at our business as collection of assets. And if there were something more to someone besides us and it's not strategic then, we got be another owner and we will take that money and put it back in the aggregates business. And so, this is no different than what you've seen us do. And we exit businesses at times and we exit different product lines at times. And so, this will make sense strategically for us to sell the Texas Ready mix business. Mike Dahl : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from the line of Keith Hughes with Truist. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Hey Keith. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning Keith Hughes : Hey, how are you doing? Thanks for taking the question. Yeah and just to shift to aggregates asphalt concrete you gave guidance, didn\u2019t down a bit of cash gross profit versus the prior year. Can you talk a little bit more in detail what\u2019s going on like this what you are expecting 2024? Tom Hill : Yeah, I think the asphalt performance in a 13% gross margin was a really good performance. Now, if you look back about three years ago, everybody was to ask me why I don't you sell that asphalt business and now everybody wants to buy more. So, that's just the asphalt business, but 13-ish percent is a good number. So it's performing well. We see flat at very high levels for 2024 and I would call that hot mix prices offsetting increasing liquid cost and increasing aggregate cost.  So Asphalt is in a very good place and we like our story there. And I think that those teams are performing well. Ready mix, I'd call it virtually flat with the private side challenge - some challenged markets do know that affects the ready mix business, but it's not a bad performance based on some of the private challenge we had. But remember ready mix is 2% of EBITDA. So, I think under the circumstances both businesses do advance. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yeah, and just in terms of ready mix, Keith, just maybe a couple things helpful to think about the impacts of the divestiture. Our expectations in 2024 for a modest decline and same-store volumes, which were about 4 million cubic yards in 2023. And we expect kind of consistent gross margin performance. I think in longer-term about that. I think that there are low-single \u2013 I mean our low-double-digit expectations are still what we're pushing for, that's going to take time and better volumes to get there. But one thing about 2024, where we expect relatively flat gross margins with the weight of the non-cash fixed cost on the volume challenges that Tom mentioned really driven by private non-res. We do expect to see some expansion in cash gross profit margins, and also in per unit profitability given the markets where we've retained our concrete businesses. Keith Hughes : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Garik Shmois : Well, hi, thanks. Congrats on the nice results. Wanted follow-up on our cost side. I know it's a little bit more favorable than the preliminary outlook you offered on the 3Q call and you spoke to some broad gauge deformation, getting better as you move through year of operational improvements helping as well. Anything in particular though that changed or has gotten better since the last call that you could point to the cost side. And that\u2019d be helpful. Tom Hill : Yeah, I think what you're seeing there is the Vulcan Way of Operating inefficiencies in those plants. And that's embedded in that is technology. It is training which is so important from a safety side but also from a plant availability and inspection of equipment. And then our throughputs \u2013 you are seeing our throughputs of crooks sizes start to improve. So it's a combination of easing inflationary pressures, comps kind of level out, but also those operating efficiencies are really, really important to making sure that we our job is to beat inflation, not just live with it. Tom Hill : Got it. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Angel Castillo : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe understand I thought I heard you say I guess that given the kind of capital that you have, you still have the ability to kind of do organic inorganic and return capital to shareholders. So just wanted to expand on that a little bit. It sounds like on the M&A front you're looking at more bolt-ons. And if I did the math correctly just moving to the midpoint of your kind of leverage allows you to have at least another kind of $2 billion of what kind of capital that you can deploy which seems plenty for both M&A as well as other ways of kind of returning cash to shareholders. So maybe just could you talk about buyback intentions for the year? And then also willingness of potentially levering up above your range - historical range for the right opportunities and returning cash to shareholders? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yeah. Sure. I mean, as you referenced, I think we're really well positioned to be able to fund all of our capital allocation priorities in 2024. And as it relates to returning cash to shareholders, doing that via repurchases has long been a part of our capital allocation priorities. I think appropriately following reinvesting in the business, growing the business through both M&A and Greenfields and returning cash, through our sustainable dividends. But with the attractive cash generation and you saw what deferred M&A in 2023, We did repurchase $200 million of shares. And we would enter 2024 thinking about making those capital allocation decisions in the same kind of disciplined manner. And in terms of ,leverage I think for us regardless of where we are, and the - against kind of our target leverage range, what's important is being disciplined about doing the right deals and the deals that are going to have attractive returns for us. And we certainly have overtime levered up even outside the top end of that range with plans to always quickly get back within that two to two-and-a-half times that that we tend to target. Angel Castillo : Very helpful. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Mary Andrews, Mark, Tom. Tom Hill : Good morning. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Michael Dudas : I am curious about your thoughts. You've indicated a positive trend for civil public infrastructure and the records state on the transportation budgets, are they prepared and ready to pull through when you see some of the budget numbers in your important States? I'm also curious on how things in California because you hear it certainly CALTRANS has bumped up budget there, but certainly there could be some other issues there. So just a little bit of sense on the public side in your important states how you see the opportunities for bidding and project work going forward? Tom Hill : Yeah, I think, they're still challenged but there you go because they got so much money. It's a lot for them to digest but they are growing into it. And as I said, we'll see solid growth in highways in \u201824. We saw low-single-digits in \u201923. We\u2019d expect mid-single-digit in \u201824 kind of as expected. But also we got to remember that IJ passed in November of \u201921. So we're just past that two year mark and while I say it takes two years. As we've said, it will be a ramp up not a step change in this. I think it will be a ramp up over time and I think that the DOTs are growing into their capital \u2013 added resources and the revenues continue to be healthy. There is a lot of money out there, but I would \u2013 what I would see here I think is kind of slow and steady wins the race and we'll see improving growth in \u201824 kind of mid-single-digit. I think that will go up in \u201925. Again I think that demand will go from \u201826 and I was thinking to go from \u201927. So, that slow and steady improvement in public isn't bad particularly when you're compounding unit margins like we are.  As far as CALTRANS, I think they'll be fine. There's always some rumblings numerous times in CALTRANS and funding and people try to grab it. But remember, it is firewall. It has to be used for infrastructure. Michael Dudas : Excellent. Thank you, Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question from the line of Brent Stillman with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Brent Stillman : Hey, thanks. Tom and Mary. I guess some clarification on the ready mix business kind of refinement of that over the last 12 months. Can you sort of level set us on what that business is now sized? Could you exit it 7.5 million cubic yards in \u201823. Where do we go from here? And I guess my other question on the last is, I think we\u2019ve all been sort of worried about the implications and some this light non-residential activity sort of more interest rates central instructors hitting your business. Could you talk about to what degree that's actually had an impact? Is it been more resilient than you would have expected? Tom Hill : I'll take that one, first and then I\u2019ll let Mary Andrews take the ready mix. I think it\u2019s been fairly weak for us. Obviously opposite has been weak, but last year the right size was pretty weak. So kind of more of the same on that still challenged by interest rates. And Mike, I would tell you that my view of that is that the more traditional ex office building, more traditional like non-residential construction usually follows creation of subdivisions. And so we're back in growth mode, subdivision. So I would expect us some time, maybe \u201825 middle of \u201825 that starts to impact that sector of the light risk. So it probably has a brighter future than what we've seen in \u201823 and \u201924. But it was kind of when I try to describe \u201824 is more of the same for \u201823. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yeah, and in terms of ready mix, we completed the divestiture of the Texas Concrete in mid-November and had disclosed that was about 4 million cubic yards annually. So that that puts us in 2023 at about 4 million cubic yards on a same-store basis. We would expect those volumes to decline modestly and our 2024 outlook of the those cash gross profit dollars being 30% of that 275 kind of as I said consistent from a gross margin percentage standpoint with 2023 that, expansion from a cash gross profit percentage standpoint and not business where we're focused on continuing to improve that margin performance over time for the retained assets that we have which we believe are very attractive and well-structured ready mix markets. Brent Stillman : Okay. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Tom for any closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you for your time this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We look forward to talk to you throughout the quarter. Please keep yourselves and your family safe. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. James Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining our Vulcan Materials earnings call this morning. Our first quarter results moved us towards delivering on a fourth consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Although the weather was unusually cold and wet across many geographies for much of the quarter, our teams executed well and improved our Aggregates cash gross profit per ton by 10%. Their commitment to our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines is driving solid results. In the quarter, we generated $323 million of adjusted EBITDA and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin. Importantly, several key trends continue : Pricing momentum, cost deceleration, unit profitability expansion, robust cash generation, disciplined capital allocation and return on invested capital improvement. In the Aggregates segment, year-over-year shipments declined by 7%, but the durability of our Aggregates business and the consistency of our execution stood out in a weather impacted quarter. We again improved our trailing 12 months Aggregate's cash gross profit per ton, pushing it to $9.66 per ton and making further progress toward our current $11 to $12 target. The pricing environment remains positive and year-over-year Aggregates cash cost of sales continues to moderate. Aggregates freight adjusted price improved 10% in the quarter and increased $1.25 per ton sequentially from the fourth quarter, a clear illustration of the success of January increases and the continuous execution of our Vulcan Way of Selling disciplines. Our first quarter cash cost of sales performance resulted in a fourth consecutive quarter of trailing 12 months cost deceleration and improving sequentially by another 230 basis points. Our relentless focus on improving efficiencies in our plants through our Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines remains a key driver of managing costs, expanding unit profitability and ultimately generating attractive free cash flow. There is a healthy pipeline of opportunities to deploy this free cash flow for both attractive acquisitions and complementary strategic greenfield development. These targeted opportunities are at varying stages. But as an example, earlier this week, we closed on a bolt-on Aggregates and Asphalt acquisition in Alabama, [indiscernible] state. I'm proud of how our teams continue to execute our 2-pronged growth strategy. They are focused on expanding our reach in addition to enhancing our core with consistent expansion of unit profitability by controlling what we can control, even in a dynamic macro environment and demand environment. On the demand side, I want to provide a few comments about each end use, starting with private demand and then moving to public. Momentum in single-family continues to accelerate across our footprint and points to growth in 2024. However, we continue to expect weaker multifamily residential construction to largely offset the single-family approval this year. Overall, affordability and elevated interest rates remains a challenge, but the underlying fundamentals of population growth and low inventories in Vulcan markets support recovery in residential construction. An improving residential backdrop is also a positive sign for future activity in certain categories of nonresidential construction. And recent data has shown some signs of stabilization in overall [ stash ]. However, the landscape continues to vary across categories. As expected, continued moderation in warehouse [ stash ] will be the biggest headwind to private and nonresidential demand this year. Currently, light commercial activity remains weak, but over time, we expect it to follow the positive trends in single-family housing. We continue to see and capitalize on opportunities in the manufacturing category. Our unmatched Southeastern footprint and unique logistics capabilities positions us well to service these large Aggregates intensive projects. Our footprint is also an advantage on the public side with over 2/3 of federal highway spending allocated to Vulcan states. Additionally, other public infrastructure activity, which benefits from IIJA funding is growing faster in Vulcan states than the country as a whole. It sustained elevated level of highway [ stash ] of over $100 billion, coupled with record 2024 state budgets, supports healthy growth in highway and infrastructure demand both in 2024 and for the next several years. Now I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our first quarter. Mary Andrews? Mary Carlisle : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Tom discussed our solid Aggregates results in the quarter and shared some important ongoing trends. In addition to providing a few more details about our first quarter results, I'd like to first expound upon 4 of the trends Tom highlighted earlier in his remarks : Unit profitability expansion, robust cash generation, disciplined capital allocation and return on invested capital improvement. For the last 4 quarters, we have consistently expanded our trailing 12-month unit profitability in all 3 of our operating segments. Increasing cash unit profitability by nearly $1.50 per ton in Aggregates, almost $6 per ton in Asphalt and nearly $5 per cubic yard in Concrete. Our trailing 12 months gross margin has also steadily improved in each product line. This organic growth is underpinned by our daily focus on execution and driving results through our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines. Better unit profitability yields better free cash flow. Our free cash flow conversion over the last 5 years has averaged over 90%, enabling us to strategically allocate capital to reinvest in our franchise, grow our business and return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we invested $103 million in capital expenditures and returned $81 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to expect to spend between $625 million and $675 million on capital expenditures for the full year. Our current balance sheet positions us well to continue to deploy capital to each of our priorities. At the end of the first quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 1.5x, with $300 million of cash on hand, following the March 1 redemption of our 2026 senior notes at par for $550 million. Our liquidity position and financial flexibility are competitive strengths as we look to continue to grow and create value for our shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we've achieved a 260 basis points improvement in return on invested capital. Invested capital has increased less than 1%, while adjusted EBITDA has improved 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin has also improved by 350 basis points through consistent operational execution and disciplined SAG cost management. SAG expenses in the quarter were in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect to spend between $550 million and $560 million for the full year. Most importantly, we reaffirm our expectations of delivering adjusted EBITDA between $2.15 billion and $2.3 billion for the full year. At the midpoint, a double-digit year-over-year improvement for a fourth consecutive year. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom to provide a few closing remarks. James Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews. At Vulcan, our #1 priority will always be our people, keeping them safe and fostering our Vulcan culture. They are the foundation of our great company. As a team, we are focused on the daily execution of our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines to ensure attractive cash generation in any macro backdrop. We will be strategic and disciplined in allocating capital to continue to grow our business and deliver value for our shareholders. And now, Mary Andrews and I, will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Stanley Elliott : Tom, nice start to the year, very clean quarter despite kind of some of the weather issues, I think a lot of people had and some of the comp issues. Can you talk about how the rest of the year plays out, thinking about this more like maybe from a demand standpoint? And then to any extent commentary you could share on April would be great. James Hill : Sure. Looking at the quarter itself, I'd call the quarter -- volumes in the quarter as expected within the margin of error. We had less shipping days in March, but about the same amount of shipping days in the quarter overall. January was a slow start, really due to wet weather and cold weather. February and March, I call it a bit better, better on a daily shipping basis. So Q1, all things considered as expected. As we look forward to the rest of the year, I don't see any real change in our thinking on demand. We would still guide to the flat to down [ 4 ], and the dynamics are very similar to what we said last quarter, headwinds in nonresidential, some challenges in multifamily. We've got recovering single-family construction and growing public demand. I think that our position -- our superior position in the Southeast really helps, the footprint makes a difference. And that Southeastern market is probably the healthiest market in the country. I think our Vulcan Way of Selling disciplines and tools are very helpful with this. So at this point, I'd call it confident for volume outlook. As far as going into the second quarter, I'd call it this way, when the sun comes out, we're shipping very well. Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Bettenhausen with Truist Securities. Jonathan Bettenhausen : I'm curious about your outlook on midyear pricing. You had conversations with your customers about midyear. And I'm also wondering how much of that is baked into your guide? James Hill : Yes. I'd start off with saying that I think the fundamentals in pricing remained very good and very healthy. As you saw, we had a solid start in Q1 with prices a little north of 10%, that was really across every market. And so it's a really good start and supports our full year guidance. Midyear price increases are not in our guidance at this point. We're having those midyear price discussions right now, so it's a little too early to call. Remember, the midyears will be good for 2024, but they're going to be even better for '25. So our teams are working really hard on this, and I think I'm sure they'll deliver. The most important thing, though, I think, is that the fundamentals for pricing remain very healthy. And so I think when it comes to midyears, we'll revisit pricing guidance in August and give you an update. Mary Carlisle : And one more thought on price. We always like to point out how important it is to remember that regardless of what the level of pricing is, the key is really how much price we're able to take to the bottom line. In the first quarter, we achieved 10% improvement in cash gross profit per ton and some Aggregates margin expansion even given the lower volume quarter due to the weather. Overall, gross margin also improved by 140 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded as well. So importantly, we expect this margin expansion to continue and to improve further through the balance of the year. Operator : We'll go now to Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how costs have kind of been trending among your major cost categories. If you can touch on maybe some of the nonenergy categories. And then also just with higher diesel, how that's impacted conversations around price increases or just how you think about the full year from that context? James Hill : Yes. I think the first quarter for cost is always tricky as volumes and weather definitely had an impact on costs in the first quarter. That said, I think we're still comfortable with the cost guidance of up mid-single digit for the full year. As always, we would get you to look at costs on a trailing 12-month basis because it's just going to be choppy on quarter-to-quarter. And if you look back on a trailing 12-month basis over the last year, cost increases have fallen from, I'd say, mid-teens to single digit. So as we said in the prepared remarks, we've seen 4 quarters of decelerating cost and as we march through this year, we should see that those increases decline as we march through the year, next quarter better, next quarter better, next quarter better as we saw over the last 4 quarters. So I think we're on a good path to that mid-single-digit cost for the full year. As far as different pieces of this, a diesel was probably a slight tailwind in the quarter. What stays up is parts and services remain elevated, but our comps are getting easier. And I think that we also through the Vulcan Way of Operating, we're improving our operating efficiencies and will continue over the next 2 years with that to offset those inflated parts and services. So I think we're in a good place, and I think the teams are working through this, and I'm pleased with what I see. Mary Carlisle : Yes. And in terms of diesel, Anthony, we do assume in our plan that it will move somewhat higher through the rest of the year. And you're right, while diesel prices for us -- well, they're always hard to predict and -- but they can really be a good thing in this business since we have the ability to catch it with pricing as it goes up and also take advantage of it when it goes down. Operator : We'll go now to Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Kathryn Thompson : Stepping back, just looking at the bigger picture. In last year, you divested mainly downstream ops just in terms of optimizing portfolio. As you look into 2024 and beyond what are your priorities in terms of overall Vulcan Materials and product mix? And how does this mix strategy -- how do you think about that against the backdrop of a broad reindustrialization of the U.S. and putting Vulcan in the best position possible? James Hill : Well, as always, we would tell you that it's Aggregates and we are an Aggregates company. We have the highest percentage of EBITDA in Aggregates of probably anybody in the sector, and that's what we do. Now we have strategic downstream. And as we always say, it's a portfolio, we look at it as a portfolio, and if one of those sectors or geographies doesn't earn appropriate return or somebody else would divest of it and plow that money back into our Aggregates business. So I think that nothing has changed as far as how we look at the world. And as we look at the growth part of M&A in greenfields, it will be Aggregates focused. Operator : We'll now turn to Trey Grooms with Stephens. Trey Grooms : I kind of want to follow up on the comment, Mary Andrews, you had earlier about cash gross profit per ton. Clearly, it was up 10% in the quarter. I think you were maybe initially looking for mid- to high single-digit improvement. So maybe a little better there. And then full year is mid -- I think looking for mid-teens type of improvement. So I guess the first one is kind of how we see that progress. I think it's going to accelerate somewhat as we go through the year, but any way to help us kind of think about that as we progress through the year to get to that mid-teens for the full year? And then maybe stepping back a little bit longer term. These are clearly better numbers of better performance than the historical kind of average of profitability improvement. How are you thinking about that longer term? Do you think it has the opportunity to kind of see a long-term better kind of consistent improvement versus kind of historicals? James Hill : Yes. Let me take your last question first about long term. This is why we have developed the Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines. I think they secure our ability to improve cash gross profit per ton, which we've done 12-month basis every quarter [indiscernible] going flat for 5 years. That's pretty good consistency even with some of the dynamics that are out there. So I think that overall in history, we -- versus history, we're in a better place for higher improvements in cash gross profit per ton, and that's not by actions, that's by design, and we've been working on that now for years, and it is working and those tools are only getting better or we're getting better implementing them. I think as far as this year is concerned, as we talked about, as we progress through the year, you've got cost increases decelerating and as inflation comps get easier and our operating efficiencies get better. So that's one piece of that. And then I think as we march through the year, we have the ability to continue to raise prices, both in what we do on project work, but also a fixed plant. So you put all that together, I think as we progress through the year, we have the opportunity to continue to march our unit margins improvement through the year. Operator : We'll go next to Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if you could just talk about how you expect the pricing cadence to play out this year over the past couple of years, third quarter versus second quarter, we saw a big $0.60 type step up in pricing. Is that feels like that's what you're assuming this year to get to the guidance. But maybe Mary Andrews, you could expand on how you expect the cadence to play out? And how much higher could that be if we do implement midyear price increases? Mary Carlisle : Yes, sure. I would expect a cadence of, Jerry, likely some sequential growth in the second quarter, more in the third quarter, as you referenced, and then we would typically see less in the fourth quarter due mostly to seasonality. And the magnitude of the midyears, which as Tom referenced earlier, it's just too early to call at this point, but that's what would influence that third quarter sequential improvement and to what level that gets and where we fall out overall. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then in terms of just the exit rate with double-digit pricing growth exiting the year and potential midyears on top of it, I guess that suggests the starting point for '25 should be in the high single-digit pricing range just from a carryover effect. And I just want to make sure that that's consistent with how you folks are thinking about it. James Hill : Yes. I think when it comes to midyears, we're going to call that when we earn it. And I think we feel good about midyears, and I think those conversations are going fine. As I said, they mean a lot for '25. I do think it's a bit early to call what '25 is going to start out at. We got to get midyears under our belt and take a look at what we're going to do in the first part of '25. But I do think it's -- I feel good about the midyears and I think it is a good omen for 2025 pricing. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl : I'm going to follow up again on kind of midyears. I think last quarter, you talked about how those conversations would be April conversations, so maybe it's just semantics, and you want to have those really finalized before you communicate to us. But I'm wondering if just given some of the wet weather to start the year, if some of those conversations perhaps got pushed out a little bit relative to your expectations or how you characterize that? And any other regional differences in pricing that you may be experiencing relative to what you thought coming into the year? James Hill : I don't think weather had anything to do with it. I think you may have read a little bit too much into the April month comment. You send the letters out in April, you spend May having those conversations and you finalize end of May, kind of beginning of June. So I don't see anything different in timing or sequencing versus what we did last year. Like I said, I think I'm encouraged by the conversations that we're having, and I think that we will implement a solid midyear price increases. But I wouldn't read anything into the comment on weather versus -- excuse me, comment on April versus how this goes. It's really kind of a process. We introduced it in April, have conversations in May and again, finalize it in June. Mary Carlisle : And one other thought on pricing for the rest of the year is that we've had positive momentum over the last 12 months in our bid work, and that should also be a good catalyst for us from where we ended Q1 to where we expect to be for the full year in addition to whatever is realized on midyear increases. Operator : We'll go now to Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : I wanted to ask on the M&A environment. If you could provide a little bit more color on the bolt-on that you just completed? And is it possible at all to maybe size how much are you going to anticipate spending on acquisitions this year and the types of deals you're looking at? James Hill : Yes. As you saw, we had a small but strategic bolt-on kind of northeast of Birmingham up sort of Guntersville. It's about 2 million tons of Aggregates and just under 0.5 million tons of Asphalt. It fits us well. I think as you look at the full year, the next 12 months, M&A outlook is quite good. So more to come. And I'm having a lot of those conversations and very encouraged by it. I think it's always M&A will be Aggregates-led and conducted with discipline. But I think we feel very confident that this will be a busy M&A year for us. Operator : And now we'll go to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor: I guess I wanted to kind of tap your many years of experience in this business with respect to the second half of this year in election years. And in an election year, do you find that projects kind of accelerate as people kind of focus on [indiscernible]? Or do you think things maybe slow down a little bit as people get a little more [indiscernible] and wait to see how the election plays out? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about the risk around second half volumes in public sector spending. James Hill : I don't see -- I will take it in pieces. Overall, I don't see any impact with the election year on our demand. I think that our guidance is -- has taken the factors into account. I don't think election year moves the needle on that. I think on the public side, it is really the DOTs trying to get highway dollars into lettings and into projects. And I think that's happening. And I think we call that, as you know, mid-single digit on the private side, I think, as we said, we've got some challenges on nonres and multi. And I think that single-family is recovering with health. So that's how I look at it with not much impact from the election year. Operator : And next, we have Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : I wanted to ask about a little bit more on the demand side as well. How is the government infrastructure dollars? How are they flowing through? How are you seeing the pace of that activity? Any evidence of some of those larger IRA projects? And any sign that data centers could make much of a dent against the decline in warehouse demand? James Hill : Yes. I will start with highways. We're seeing the IIJA money and the local funds flow into lettings. At this point, we'd stick with that mid-single-digit growth on the public side this year, which is both non-highway infrastructure and highways. And we see that kind of steady growth for years to come. We also are seeing additional state funding come into play. We've got 3 states with some big dollars. Tennessee added $3 billion, Florida I think added $4 billion and Georgia just added $1.5 billion to their funding. I think when it comes to public demand, slow and steady wins the race on this, and particularly when you're compounding your margins like we are, so I think a good healthy sector with steady growth for years to come. And I think the DOTs will continue to work hard to get those dollars into lettings. Mary Carlisle : And Timna, you also mentioned data centers, which have never really provided some good opportunities for us in some markets. I can think of some projects we booked recently in Virginia, Alabama, Georgia. And it's obviously a subject that's getting a lot of press. But I do think it's important to remember that the square footage according to Dodge for data centers is only a low single-digit percentage of total non-res [indiscernible]. So as you know, there are a lot of different categories and dynamics and private non-res, so data centers may not move the needle overall. But overall, for us, in non-res, right -- so far, it's playing out as we expected with kind of all those different dynamics. Operator : We'll go now to Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Patrick Brown : So [indiscernible] doing a great job on unit margins. But I am curious what you're seeing on the plant productivity side. Because If I go back, Tom, to the Vulcan Way of Operating, some of the technology rollouts in the plants that you talked about at the Analyst Day, I'm just kind of curious how those are tracking if you're seeing improved plant utilization? And is that kind of a continued good guidance to '25? James Hill : Yes. I think that where we are on that, and you're talking about the process intelligence on those plants. As we said, we did that in our top 100 plants, which is about 7% of our -- roughly 7% of our production. The tools are all there. About 25%, 30% are actually -- of those plants are actually fully utilizing those tools. And there's a lot of work that has to go into that to get the screens right and everybody trained in those, we're seeing marked progress as we march through kind of this year, maybe the first part of next year, we'll get up to 100% of those. But -- and as we do, we'll see improvement. So where it's working. I think it's working well, maybe a little slower than I would have wanted it to go through as far as full implementation, but we're getting there. And I think we'll see that. As you said, we'll see progress to that show up in our numbers in '24 and in '25 and into '26, to be honest with you. So, so far, so good, and we'll keep plugging at it. Operator : And now we'll hear from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam Thalhimer : Great quarter. On the demand side, I guess I wanted to hit that as well. There's a lot of angst out there about just private construction demand in general. Are you guys seeing any incremental weakness or strength there? James Hill : Well, I think it depends on which part of it you're talking about, and I'll take them a piece at a time. We're seeing -- on the non-res side, you've got weakness in warehouses and kind of traditional light non-res. That being said, the warehouses, we -- if you look at starts, they are -- the fall is decelerating. It's getting better as you look at starts on a short-term basis. So hopefully, that will get better. You've got strength in large manufacturing projects, which we've got 11 of those big projects, and we're shipping on them now and I think more to come. So it's too early to call whether it's getting better or getting worse, but that's kind of how we call it for -- on the non-res side. On highways -- excuse me, on housing, I would tell you the weakness is in multifamily and continues that. I think it doesn't last too long, we'll be past that, I think, '25. And then single-family res is recovering, and I think recovering with some momentum. Operator : We'll go now to Phil Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng : Congrats on a really strong quarter. I had a question. I mean, a competitor of yours has just closed on a deal in the Southeast, and they've already announced price increases for midyears in those markets and called out how pricing there is for us below their corporate average. I've always thought that the Southeast is actually a pretty good pricing market. Do you see that dynamic improving the backdrop on pricing, anything on the structure side of things? And then similarly, California, I think pricing still kind of below what that market probably should warrant just given the cost and demand profile. Any thoughts on the momentum modern pricing around California as well? James Hill : Yes, I think we've got to be thoughtful when we call out pricing on individual markets. But that being said, the Southeast is very good pricing, some of the best we have. And I think that if you look at the western part of the United States, I think we're seeing marked improvement in pricing, and we'll continue -- that momentum will continue. Operator : And now we'll go to Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Angel Castillo Malpica : Just wanted to maybe expand a little bit on some of the dynamics. First, just a quick clarifier. For pricing, is the assumption still 10% to 12%, given the kind of unchanged top line? And then You mentioned kind of no impact from election year. Could you maybe talk about some of the other dynamics that are at play here in terms of the weakness you're seeing in non-resi and just interest rate environment and kind of some of those challenges. Is that having any kind of impact on your midyears? It sounds like the discussions there have been quite constructive. So just any kind of color there would be helpful. James Hill : Yes. I think you're seeing improvement. We're seeing improvement in single-family, which is always helpful. And the most important thing is that you see growth in public demand, which is still visible and it is a very good foundation for pricing. I don't know that interest rates have had a big impact on pricing. Obviously, they'll have -- they've had impacts on demand and volumes. But I think -- so I think that -- and I don't think that the election year has had any impact on pricing dynamics. So I think that the fact that we've got strong, very visible public demand for a long time is good. I think you've got some improvement in res. All of that is helping the pricing dynamics. And I think we feel pretty good about a midyear at this point. Operator : We'll go now to Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : So it's an interesting highlight on 67% of your of the IIJA dollars are going to the Vulcan states. So you can talk a little bit about what states does that matching up with some of the DOT budgets in some of your important states? And what it may be throughout the business, what regions or states maybe are lagging a bit that may have some opportunity to catch up as we move into the next several quarters? James Hill : Well, I think a big part of that is you've got the big DOTs, Caltrans and TxDOT and Georgia DOT and Virginia. Obviously, Tennessee, obviously, have excellent funding, both state and local. I think that probably the most -- the best -- DOT is best at getting money through at this point because they started earlier with their own funding with Texas. Georgia had some struggles, but I think is catching up with that. So I think Caltrans is doing a good job getting their money in. Illinois, I think, has struggled getting some of their funding out. So that's how I call it. But I think they're all plugging at it, and I think they're all getting better at it. It is coming through with improvement in lettings. I think that all of them are going through the '25 budgeting right now, a little too early to call, but I don't see them going down. I would expect most of them to go up. So as we said, I think that it's a long road. I think it's steady growth in public, and it's not just highways, it's also the infrastructure, which is ports and airports and water and sewage and that will be substantial growth, I think, this year and for years to come. Operator : And at this time, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill, Chief Executive Officer, for any additional or closing comments. James Hill : I thank all of you for your time this morning and your interest and support of Vulcan Materials Company. We hope you and your families are healthy and safe and stay that way through the quarter, and we look forward to talking to you over the next few months. Thanks. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

My name is Todd, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. Please be reminded that today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay later today at the company's website. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Mary Andrews Carlisle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our website vulcanmaterials.com. Please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation and other SEC filings. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. Our results demonstrate how our teams have successfully navigated a challenging first half of the year. Unfavorable weather conditions in many key markets impacted our shipments and operating efficiencies. Our second quarter performance reinforces our consistent execution the durable characteristics of our aggregates-led business and the benefits of our continued focus on both enhancing our core and expanding our reach. Even in the face of lower aggregate shipments, and weather-driven inefficiencies, our teams delivered a seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year improvement in aggregates unit profitability. In our trailing 12 months, average cash gross profit per ton has reached $9.96 per ton, marking consistent progress towards our $11 to $12 target. These achievements exhibit the benefits of our commitment to enhancing our core through our Vulcan selling and Vulcan way of operating disciplines. But our strategy is two-pronged, and we are also focused on expanding our reach. During the second quarter, we closed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions. These acquisitions enhance both our aggregate production and distribution capabilities and our downstream asphalt business in Alabama, Texas, two of our top 10 states. In the quarter, we generated $603 million of adjusted EBITDA and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 170 basis points despite 5% lower area shipments. Shipments in the quarter were negatively impacted by a significant number of rain days in many markets, particularly in May across 70% of our geographies and in select key markets in April and June. The pricing environment remained positive and freight-adjusted average selling prices improved 12% on or $2.29 per ton versus the prior year. Freight adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 13% or $1.13 per ton. Most importantly, cash gross profit per ton improved over $1 per ton or 12%. We remain consistently focused on improving unit profitability on every ton we sell to maximize earnings and aeration in any man environment. Let me share with you my thoughts on the current demand backdrop by discussing each end use. Single family starts again recovering in the second half of last year and continue to point growth in 2024, albeit at a slightly lower level than we had initially anticipated. The timing of starts converting to shipments continued affordability issues and persistent elevated interest rates are impacting both the pace of recovery and the likelihood of single-family growth fully offsetting weaker multifamily activity. Looking ahead, the underlying fundamentals of population growth and low inventories in Vulcan markets continue to support long-term growth in residential construction. In private nonresidential construction, the landscape continues to vary across categories, but is unfolding largely as we anticipated for 2024. Warehouse activity is the biggest headwind with some positive momentum in manufacturing activity in data centers. Light commercial activity is still relatively weak, but over time, we expect it to follow the positive trends in single-family housing and benefit from lower interest rates. On the public side, we continue to expect growth in 2024 as two consecutive years of record growth in contract awards flow into projects and aggregate shipments. The IIJ funding is benefiting both highways and other public infrastructure activity. Given the demand backdrop just discussed and the weather impacted first half shipments being down 6%, we now expect aggregate shipments to decline between 4% and 7% for the full year. Combined with solid pricing environment and double-digit profitability improvement, we still anticipate same-store adjusted EBITDA growth, margin expansion and attractive free cash flow generation in 2024. Now I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our results and revised outlook. Andrew? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. The strong fundamentals of our aggregates-led business and our consistent execution continued to deliver attractive cash generation, which, coupled with disciplined capital allocation, is driving our returns on invested capital higher over time. During the second quarter, we deployed capital to reinvest in and expand our existing franchise to grow our business through acquisitions and to return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures for maintenance and growth projects were $195 million in the quarter and $298 million on a year-to-date basis. We continue to expect to spend between $625 million and $675 million for the full year. During the quarter, we also allocated $181 million to the strategic bolt-on acquisition Tom mentioned earlier and returned $111 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and common stock repurchases. At June 30, our return on invested capital has improved 160 basis points over the last 12 months, with a 10% improvement in adjusted EBITDA generated on flat average invested capital. And with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage of 1.7 times at quarter end, we have considerable investment capacity within our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times to capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities that will drive long-term value creation for shareholders. SAG expenses in the quarter were 6.7% of revenue and year-to-date have increased less than 3% over the prior year. We are focused on both disciplined cost control and [technical difficulty] in the first six months and lower shipments, we now expect unit freight adjusted cash cost of sales to increase high single digits compared to the prior year. We continue to expect aggregates prices to increase 10% to 12% for the year, driving another year of double-digit improvement in cash gross profit per ton. We anticipate that the strong unit profitability improvement, coupled with the lower volume expectations, will generate adjusted EBITDA between $2 billion and $2.15 billion for the full year. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom to provide a few closing remarks. Thomas Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews. I want to conclude by thanking our talented Vulcan team for their commitments to each other and to excellence. As they work each day, Rainer Schein, to operate safely and deliver value for our customers and our shareholders. I am confident that we have the right, two-pronged strategy of enhancing our core and expanding our reach. And I'm excited about the runway ahead of us on both fronts to drive attractive growth for Vulcan Materials. And now Marry Andrew and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Please go ahead. Stanley Elliott : Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. Tom, could you talk a little bit more about just the overall demand environment? I understand there's been pretty tough operating conditions kind of on a year-to-date basis, and probably even into July a little bit. Any sort of help in how we should think about the balance of the year, kind of where you see momentum and things like that? Thomas Hill : Yes, good morning Stanley. I think, Stanley, all of the data and the leading indicators would support demand as we originally expected back in February, with the exception of single-family demand growth the growth in single family is a little slower than we would have expected maybe four or five months ago, and we'll talk about that a little bit later. But as we look at the current volume guidance, as you said, we had a very wet July that influenced those numbers and will definitely have a negative impact on Q3. Where we ultimately fall in that volume range of a negative 4% negative 7% will really come down to the number of dry shipping days, we have left in the last five months of the year. So I'd frame it underlying demand as expected, except a little bit slower growth in single family, weather has not been our friend. We'll see how the second half goes. I think the good news is we continue to expand unit margins by double-digit. And I think our folks have taken a difficult hand in the first half and turn it to a winner, and I'm proud of their performance. Stanley Elliott : Great, guys, thanks so much. And Beth, welcome to backyard. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Garik Shmois : Hi thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on that point with respect to the second half volume outlook. I was wondering if you could go into maybe a little bit more detail on how to think about the pent-up demand opportunity. I think you did speak to weather influencing you can get all the projects done. But is this the case of projects being delayed and not canceled, and just maybe a little bit more color on how you expect the second half of the year to play out from demand? Thanks. Thomas Hill : Sure. I think that if you kind of look at what's happened and take that into the second half, your point of demand doesn't go away. It's absolutely spot on. And you probably got some pent up there and it comes down to what the weather does to us. I think it's - looking back, if you'll explain the future that we were really impacted by rain in the first half, and I'll give you a couple of examples. In Q2, Nashville had 30 rain days, and it dramatically impacted shipments. Look, we lost half of our shipping days in that Middle Tennessee market, DFW had doubled the amount of rainfall. So we just have dried out and couldn't ship. The flip side of that is, you saw Atlanta weather pretty much normal and shipments were as expected. L.A. had weather normal and shipments were right on where we had planned. So weather has played a role it will impact Q3 as July was very wet. And now we're experiencing a tropical storm on the East Coast. So kind of a tough start to the third quarter. But as you said, the demand is still there. It's as we thought it was going to be. So these are temporary events and it doesn't go away. So, we get dry days we're shipping just fine. Garik Shmois : Great, thank you. Thomas Hill : Operator, is there another question. Operator : Yes, I apologize. So we will take our next question from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : You raised the guide for cost inflation from mid-single digit to high single-digit should we think about that incremental cost inflation as just essentially all volume deleverage? And are there any other kind of puts or takes, either good or bad, that we should think about for the second half on costs, whether it's diesel or other items? Thomas Hill : Yes. I think you're insightful about the volume impact. It definitely has an impact on us. you saw our first half of 11%. I'd also tell you that it has been - inflation was as we expected. Weather was a big difference in that and don't underestimate the efficiency impact of trying to run wet sticky material versus dry rock, which just flows a lot better. We think we can cost some of that cost back in the second half, so we can get back to the high single-digit for the full year versus the 11% where we are. And I think all of that allows us to continue that double-digit unit margin growth. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thomas Hill : Hi Jerry. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Jerry Revich : Hi, Tom, Mary Andrews, Mark. Good morning. Pricing for agri was really strong in the quarter, up nicely sequentially. Can you just talk about the confidence around midyear that you focus in place guidance did not assume major pricing and it feels like you've got momentum just from contracts rolling. So I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on how you expect the tailwind just from natural contracts rolling to play out in the third quarter, compared to last year and then the incremental opportunity from midyears? Thomas Hill : Yes, I'll give you some color on price let Mary just talk about sequential. The pricing momentum continues in all markets and all product lines. We had a successful midyear pricing campaign. I think both by customer and by market, I'd call it as we thought it was going to be as anticipated. But remember, as we explained, those midyear prices will have a small impact on '24, but a much bigger impact on '25. So we've already begun to set the solid foundation for pricing for '25. As always, we would ultimately guide you the unit margin growth which was 12% despite weather and volumes down 5%. So I'm proud of operators hard work. Look, that kind of margin growth is tough to begin with. It's particularly difficult to earn when it's raining, you got bud in the mug. So really thanks to our team. Mary Andrews Carlisle : And Jerry, in terms of sequential growth, candidly, I would have expected a bit less sequential improvement in Q2 than what we realized really due to mix and timing. We still expect some modest additional sequential improvement in the back half given the impact of the midyear that Tom just discussed, paired with a higher jumping off point from a Q2 where we already captured some of the expected sequential improvement. I guess, as Tom said to me, what's really important is the solid underlying price environment, our continued expectation of realizing price increases in that 10% to 12% range the full year. And of course, ultimately, what you can take to the bottom line, like Tom just highlighted. Anthony Pettinari : Thank you Thomas Hill : Thank you Operator : Our next question from Kathryn Thompson with the Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Thomas Hill : Good morning, Kathryn Kathryn Thompson : Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question today. Please provide some good detail on project on your work. It's not necessarily lost, but it's delayed. And you've also given some good color just on pricing and continuing that double-digit pace, perhaps pointing to shrink a little bit more on the pricing question because it's a particular focus given lighter volumes even though those volumes are delayed. . What type of impact are you seeing from product mix and geographic mix and really not as much looking backwards, but looking forward, in part because our channel checks are showing that you're starting to see a ramp-up of some larger infrastructure projects that were taking a while to build up. So any color that you can talk about in terms of product mix, geographic mix and how that may impact pricing on a go-forward basis? Thank you. Thomas Hill : Yes. So I think you're correct with the ramp-up of infrastructure and public work, you'll see more base in fines, which is a little bit less lower prices. That being said, it's also lower cost and you need that mix to balance your plants, otherwise you get out of whack. I think that being said, while we'll have some impact on price, I don't expect it to have an impact on your margins. So why it's maybe not as material may not be as high as price as a concrete outer asphalt rock, he also comes with a cost benefit. So I would expect us to continue our present pace of elevated unit margins regardless of mix. Kathryn Thompson : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Angel Castillo : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just to deliberate point, but I just wanted to maybe touch base on the price discussion a little bit more. To the extent that these meters that you've done, give you any kind of insight into preliminary views in 2025. Can you just talk about what kind of the shape of that is in terms of kind of the magnitude? Are we still talking about price increases next year in the kind of high single digits, low double digits range? And kind of along with that, just any sense of kind of customer sensitivity and kind of competitive discipline around price increases would be helpful? Thomas Hill : I think we feel like the price run continues. We feel good about what we're bidding today. As I said, those mid-years, while they have a little bit of impact on second half of this year, they're going to have a much bigger impact in the first half of next year. So that leads us to also helps you when you saw having your price increase conversations in October for beginning of the year. I think it's too early to make a call on the level of pricing for 2025. But as I said, I think the conversations that happened for mid-year price increases are encouraging for 2025. Angel Castillo : That's helpful. And if I may just kind of clarify on the pricing, just a quick one. But 10% to 12%, I thought that was kind of the guidance that you had laid out before midyear. So what kind of change so that it now includes midyear [indiscernible]. Can you just help us understand that? Thomas Hill : Well, I think, as I said, the mid-year help a little bit, but it doesn't get you out of that 10% to 12%. What it does is it sets you up for 2025. Angel Castillo : Got it. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thomas Hill : Hi Mike. Michael Dahl : Hi, Tom, Mary Andrews. Thanks for taking my question. It just as maybe just to help clarify kind of the cadence because it sounds like even with July, understandably some things are moved around with whether it's not like August. It's probably been fantastic either. But when you're thinking about those puts and takes from the volume and also some of the price cost dynamics, can you put a finer point on within your guide, how you'd expect 3Q versus 4Q to play out? Thomas Hill : Yes. I think that, first of all, the third quarter has already been impacted. July was extremely wet and particularly in our southeastern markets. And now you've got troubling storm blowing up the East Coast. So it's going to - you're starting off to a little bit of a rough start in Q3. I think as we said, the fundamentals of the underlying demand are still there. You've got some pent-up demand. They're all doing, sun comes out, we'll ship well. You have asphalt producers, they're telling us get ready, because when it's dry out, we got to go. And so we'll be ready for them. I would call it - and the fourth quarter is always tough to call because it's also weather dependent, and the season, hopefully, will stretch. I do think that when you have a year where you have so much moisture it may push the season a little bit, so you may get a little extra bump out of Q4 that you wouldn't have in a normal weather year, which is because people want to get those projects done. And it comes down between the negative four to negative seven, what's - how many shipping days do you have and when you have those shipping days. So a little bit of a rocky start with July and kind of this week with that trouble storm, but again, the demand is there. And when some comes out, we're shipping fine, as I talked about with L.A. and Atlanta. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And Mike, one other thing to keep in mind as you think about third quarter versus fourth quarter and the challenging start, Tom just mentioned from a weather perspective is that strictly from a seasonal basis, we have easier, relatively easier comps in the fourth quarter than we do in the third quarter. So if you think about where those volumes fall, that's something else to keep in mind as to how the back half might play out. Michael Dahl : Got it, thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please go ahead. Thomas Hill : Hi Trey. Trey Grooms : Hi Tom. Good morning. So you guys have closed a few bolt-on acquisitions this year. But if you could maybe talk about the pain there. Are you seeing any more or less opportunities? And any potential for larger transactions out there? Thomas Hill : Yes. As you said, you saw us close on two smaller, I call it very strategic bolt-on acquisitions, kind of 1 in North Alabama and 1 in Texas. I would tell you that we'll close on some more meaningful acquisitions in the near future and which we'll share with you when the time is right. But it's a busy season for acquisitions. . Trey Grooms : Good to hear, thank you. Thank you. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Jon Allen on for David. I was just hoping you could provide some detail on what you're seeing for 2025 DOT budgets in key states for Vulcan and maybe [indiscernible] that's playing into your pricing outlook for 2025 and the ability to sustain double-digit pricing growth? Thomas Hill : Yes. So I think that as we look at public demand out there, and just in general, the highway market. We're seeing the IJAA and state and local funds flow through to highway lettings right now. Overall, demand growth is similar to expectations. Steady growth in public demand. We've got a lot more funding in critical states. You saw Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, all raise funds. George is up $1.5 billion. Tennessee had a 3, Florida had a 4. All of which -- we'll see that fund flow in the lettings in '25, '26 and '27. So 6 of our larger states are at record level funding. Texas, California are also at record levels. And all of this supports I'd say, growth and public demand for the next three or four years. So we should slow and steady wins the race here. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead. Thomas Hill : Hi Adam. Adam Thalhimer : Hi, good morning, guys. I thought it was a nice quarter. Are you -- like Trey, I was also curious on M&A. And gosh, it feels like every international materials companies trying to grow U.S. materials exposure. Are you seeing increased competition for deals? Thomas Hill : I don't think much changed. Same bidders are out there. There's a lot going on. You also got to remember, you got pent-up demand from nothing going on last year as everybody was worried about a recession. So we'll get a look at all those opportunities. We pass a lot on a lot of them. I think it comes down to M&A, it's about discipline, what markets do you want to be in what synergies are you, what are you willing to pay for it and make sure you can get a return on what you're paying and then once you buy it, integrate it accurately and rapidly. Adam Thalhimer : Sounds good. Thank you, Tom. Thomas Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Phil Ng : Hi guys. I guess, Tom, just a little more perspective on this midyear increase. How did it kind of shake out relative to perhaps last year, appreciating A lot of this is really [ 425]. So help us kind of conceptualize perhaps how much of a carrier or price lift you could see next year? And the demand...? Thomas Hill : Go ahead -- from a macro perspective, I'd say similar that's always going to be different when I say different, you get different customers, different product lines, different geographies where you got it last year, maybe you didn't get it this year or vice versa. So I would call it out very similar. Phil Ng : Okay. Any way to kind of help us think about what that could transpire to from a carrier pricing next year? And from a demand standpoint, I heard you lower underlying demand still quite good when you don't have weather -- so some of this demand seems to be pushed out to 2025, right? So if that does kind of materialize in terms of how you're thinking about end markets, are you in a position to see volumes grow next year just because it's been pretty new in the last few years. Thomas Hill : I think it's early to call. I think you continue to see growth in the public side. I think that we do know just because the funds are there and they're starting to flow into lettings. On the private side, I feel good that single-family will continue to grow. It's a little slower than what we anticipated. And it has some catch-up to do with lead indicators. And obviously, interest rates will help that. But we just don't have the inventory of houses in these markets to keep up with population growth. So I would expect the res to kind of slow and steady growth also I think the big question will be nonres. We've taken the hit on warehouses and distribution centers. The manufacturing is good, but interest rates will help that sector also. It's a matter of timing, I believe. Phil Ng : Thank you. Appreciate the call. Thomas Hill : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, gentlemen. Mary Andrews. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Tom, let me follow-up your final remark there to Phil. On the large private heavy non-res opportunities, can you talk about what your backlog looks like, how it looks on bidding relative to what it's been in the last six to 12 months? Are we seeing an acceleration of some of the larger type projects that are in your areas that you can certainly serve into over the next couple of years? Is that potentially a tailwind as we look through the second half of this year weather permitting in 2025? Thomas Hill : Yes. It is definitely a tailwind. It is helping us with backlog a number of those big projects and big manufacturing projects. We're shipping on them now when the rain fits. And I think that will help us in '25. And I think there's more behind that. You've got with 12 projects in our footprint, you've got a number of data centers and then you continue to see growth in the reshoring of manufacturing facilities. So it is a tailwind for us. I don't think it's a big enough tailwind yet to take on what happened with warehouses and distribution centers, but definitely helpful. Michael Dudas : Thank you. Thomas Hill : Operator, do you have another question? Operator : We'll take our last question from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thomas Hill : Good morning. Michael Feniger : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just, Tom, on the manufacturing side, it's been a tail on the private non-res based on your backlog pipeline, is that -- did you feel that, that means stable in '25? Because is there a risk that some of these manufacturing projects had been a tailwind kind of roll off and there's not enough to be backfilled. Just curious if you kind of address that how we head into '25? And just secondly, I know there was talks on the public infrastructure side, you highlighted the record growth in highway contract awards has really helped infrastructure this year. There's been some mixed data points in the last few months around that. Just curious if you feel like that's just more of a pause, and we see more of the funding sort of flow through to continue that trend into '25, '26? Thomas Hill : Yes. I'll take the highway on first. I think that's just a matter of timing. The fund is sort of too big there. You got a lot more coming, as I talked about, the additional state funding and 6 of our top 10 states plus IIJA. On the public side, I think that I wouldn't get too worked up about a moment in time. As I said, I think slow and steady wins the race there, and I think it will be slow and steady for the next three or four years. So I think that's solid. There will be some hotter moments and cooler moments, but overall, I think it will continue steady growth. On the manufacturing, we've got a healthy backlog, I think, and we're shipping on some of that backlog, but I don't see a big dip in the pipeline there. I think we continue to have other projects come up. And I think that's probably a strong point, particularly for Vulcan with the footprint we have. In closing, I'd like to thank you for your time and interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Our thoughts go out to our employees, our neighbors who have been or will be in the path to top storm. We hope they stay safe. We look forward to speaking with you through the quarter, and thank you again for your time this morning. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome, everyone, to the Vulcan Materials Company Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Angela, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. Please be reminded that today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay later today at the company's website. All lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Now, I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin. Mark Warren : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Mary Andrews Carlisle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our website vulcanmaterials.com. Please be reminded that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled in our earnings release, our supplemental presentation, and other SEC filings. During the Q&A, we ask that you limit your participation to one question. This will allow us to accommodate as many as possible during our time we have available. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining our call this morning. We continue to execute on our two-pronged strategy to deliver attractive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Results and activities in the third quarter demonstrate our success in consistently expanding our aggregate new profitability and successfully expanding our reach through strategic acquisition opportunities. Despite the disruption of four hurricanes impacting our industry-leading Southeast footprint, both gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded in the quarter. And year-over-year aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased double-digits for the eighth consecutive quarter, a testament to the benefits of our unwavering focus on our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines. In the quarter, we generated $581 million of adjusted EBITDA, a modest decline versus the prior year given 10% lower aggregate shipments and the prior year earnings contribution from the now divested Texas concrete business. Shipments in the quarter varied widely month-to-month and across geographies reflecting the interruption caused by extreme weather events. So let me walk you through how the quarter played out. In July, seven of our top 10 markets experienced significant year-over-year increases in rainfall and the first of four hurricanes, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in our footprint. Average daily shipments were down mid-teens for the month. Shipments in August rebounded after a slow start due to Hurricane Debby tracking up the East Coast. Daily shipments in August, excluding the two shipping days most impacted by the hurricane, were only down 4%, consistent with our non-weather impacted demand view. As we are all aware, Hurricane Helene, the second of two September hurricanes, devastated many communities across Florida, Western North Carolina, East Tennessee and other parts of the Southeast. I am thankful to report that all of our employees are safe and I'm proud of their immediate efforts to help our communities and neighbors. The catastrophic destruction in Western North Carolina and East Tennessee is both tragic and historic. Vulcan Materials is well-positioned in the affected areas to support the immense rebuilding efforts that will be required. Due to the storm, shipments were down approximately 25% in the final week of September, resulting in quarterly shipments finishing 10% below the prior year. In spite of the challenges from volume, the pricing environment remains positive. Freight adjusted average selling prices improved 10% year-over-year with increases widespread across geographies. We continue to use our Vulcan Way of Selling disciplines and processes to deliver value to our customers and earn their daily business. We also remain focused on our Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines to drive efficiencies and lower unit cost. Although, weather and lower volumes were an even more significant headwind in the third quarter than the prior quarter, the rate of cost increases moderated. At the end of September, we announced the acquisition of Wake Stone Corporation, a leading pure-play aggregate supplier in the Carolinas. This acquisition is consistent with our aggregates led growth strategy and will be a great addition to the Vulcan family. We look forward to welcoming the Wake Stone team upon closing later this year. Now, shifting to demand. The overall demand environment is improving, but with different dynamics impacting each end use. Higher single-family starts over the last 3 months and 12 months provide a solid backdrop for growing single-family demand, particularly with potentially lower mortgage rates on the horizon to help address the ongoing affordability issue. Multifamily starts remain weak but should also benefit from a lower interest rate environment. Fundamentally, there is a consistent need for additional housing in Vulcan markets, which bodes well for future residential construction activity. In private non-residential construction, demand remains varied across categories. Most categories will benefit from improving interest rates since projects in the planning and design pipeline have been accumulating for some time now. Warehouse activity remains a headwind, but comps are easing and start seem to be stabilizing near pre-COVID levels. Data centers are still robust and manufacturing remains a catalyst in some of our markets. Overtime, light commercial activity should follow the positive trends in single-family housing. We are closely monitoring the macro dynamics and likely timing of private non-residential activity making the turn. On the public side, we continue to expect steady growth for multiple years. Our booking activity points to the conversion of growth in contract awards now flowing into aggregate shipments. I am confident we are well-positioned to finish the year strong and deliver approximately $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2024. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews to discuss a few more details about the quarter and 2024 before I share some preliminary views of 2025. Mary Andrews? Mary Andrews Carlisle : Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Tom covered for you some of our important achievements in the aggregates business during the third quarter. I want to highlight a few other items that underpin our confidence in the durability of our business and the solid execution of our team. Our downstream businesses continue to strategically complement our aggregates franchise and select markets. The asphalt business maintained healthy margins at nearly 16% in the third quarter and cash unit profitability improved 11%. Our concrete business on the East Coast also delivered unit profitability improvement, while the lower volumes related to weak private demand in Northern California compressed margins in our West Coast concrete business. Our SAG expenses in the quarter were $129 million or 6.4% of revenues, 10% lower than the prior year and 20 basis points favorable as a percent of revenues. We remain dedicated to both disciplined cost control and making strategic investments in talent and technology to support our business and drive innovation. Through the first nine months we have generated nearly $1 billion of operating cash flow through our constant focus on maximizing our cash gross profit on every ton of aggregates we sell. After reinvesting over $400 million to sustain and improve our existing operations and grow our business through Greenfield development, we have yielded a 36% increase in free cash flow to deploy for expanding our reach through M&A and returning cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have allocated $206 million through strategic bolt-on acquisitions and return $252 million to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. For the full year, we now expect to spend between $625 million and $650 million of capital expenditures. Our balance sheet position provides us the strength and flexibility to grow. At September 30, net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA leverage was 1.5x, giving us ample investment capacity within our target leverage range of 2x to 2.5x to fund the Wake Stone acquisition and other growth opportunities that will drive long-term value creation for shareholders. We continue to focus on our return on invested capital, which was 16.1%, a 70 basis points improvement over the last 12 months with higher adjusted EBITDA generated on lower average invested capital. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom to provide some preliminary thoughts on 2025 and a few closing remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you, Mary Andrews. As I look at 2025 and contemplate the demand backdrop, I expect aggregate shipments to grow next year. Public construction activity remains robust and the environment is improving for the private construction activity. I am confident that Vulcan Materials will continue to execute at a high level and compound our industry-leading cash gross profit per ton at double-digit levels. I expect aggregate price to continue to outpace historical norms and improve by high-single-digit in 2025. I also expect year-over-year cost trends to improve through a combination of execution on our Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines to drive improved efficiencies in our operations and moderating inflation. Vulcan Materials has the right products, aggregates in the right markets, but more importantly, I am confident we have the right focus and the right people to execute our strategy and deliver earnings growth in 2025. And now, Mary Andrews and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Garik Shmois : Hi, thanks for having me on today. I was hoping to go over -- Tom Hill : Good morning. Garik Shmois : Hey, good morning. I was hoping you go over a little more detail on the high-single-digit pricing outlook for next year. How much carryover is there for mid-years from this year? Any help on the pacing for pricing next year and any mix impacts we should be thinking about either from a product mix or a geographic mix standpoint? Tom Hill : Yes. First of all, I don't think we have any mix put in there. But let me go back in time a little bit. If you look at our mid-year price increases, they were largely as expected, kind of by market and by customer, very much similar to last year. And so that's a really healthy start for 2025 and I think that if you take mid-year price increases and couple that with what we see in our backlogs, it allows us to carry very good price momentum and visibility into next year. As we said in the press release, I think our preliminary view is high-single-digit increases for 2025. I think I'm confident in that. If you combine that with cost increases, which continue to moderate, I think it makes me feel really good about the continued double-digit unit margin growth throughout 2025. As you heard us say in the prepared remarks, we had eight quarters of double-digit cash gross profit per ton growth and remember, seven of those eight quarters we were dealing with declining volumes. So I think we're confident we continue that streak in 2025. I guess, my -- I want to thank my teams. That's tough to do given the challenges that we've seen with weather and volume throughout this year, particularly in the third quarter. But I think they continue that success into next year. And what that tells me is that the Vulcan team is in control of the destiny to control what they can control. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And remember Garik, too, the reason we are so focused on that unit profitability improvement that Tom was talking about is that maximizing cash gross profit on every ton is the key to our free cash flow generation. To me, it's notable that on lower ag volumes and lower revenues year-to-date, EBITDA margin has expanded and free cash flow has increased 36%. So, as Tom said, our teams have executed very well in a really challenging environment. And frankly, I think they've provided a perfect example of just how durable this business is. Garik Shmois : Yes, makes sense. Thanks for the color, Tom. Operator : We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning, Trey. Trey Grooms : Hey, good morning, Tom. Good morning, Mary Andrews. Hope everybody's doing well. So I know it's not always perfect science here, easy to do. But as you look at the quarter, can you try to parse out kind of what the weather impacts may have been versus demand and maybe how each played a role in the down 10% volume that we saw here in 3Q? Tom Hill : Yes. We tried to parse that out a little bit by month in the quarter, but obviously weather has been a big story this year, and the third quarter underscored that story. If you look at the year we've had, 17 out of our 20 largest markets with more rain than prior year. I would call underlying demand kind of still down mid-single-digit ex-weather. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we saw Hurricane Milton give us a tough start. But since then we've seen good weather and we've seen our daily shipping rates bounce back, which is encouraging. But to get us back down to earth is still Q4. So how we finished the fourth quarter, I think will just depend on the number of good weather shipping days. So far so good at this point, but we got to see, I think, again in spite of extreme weather and volumes, our folks continue to expand unit margin by double-digits. So we can't control the weather, but we control how we service our customers and price and cost. But again, I would call underlying demand, mid-single-digit and the rest weather and we'll just see how the weather allows us to finish the fourth quarter. Trey Grooms : Got it. Thanks for that. And I'm sticking to one question, but I did want to congratulate you on the nice improvement there in gross profit per unit -- cash gross profit per unit, especially despite the volume headwinds that you had. So thanks, and -- Tom Hill : I appreciate that. I give all the credit to the people that sell and crush rock. Trey Grooms : There you go. Okay, I'll pass it on. Thanks, everybody. Tom Hill : Thanks, man. Operator : We will go next to Keith Hughes with Truist. Please go ahead. Keith Hughes : Thank you. Questions on volume in 2025, I know you said they're going to be up, but we have some pretty easy comps with this weather you discussed. How much could it be up and is to getting the pricing that you just discussed for 2025 or you think you'll have to walk away from some shipments in order to get pricing that high? Tom Hill : I don't think that there's any -- if we look at the kind of the volume growth at low-single-digit, I don't think you're looking at any share moving around. I look at volume to 2025. First of all, you're going to have some push from 2024 to 2025, obviously, that volume doesn't go away, it just pushes back, so that that'll be a little bit of a tailwind for us. And we'll continue to, I think experience demand challenges from like non-res and warehouse construction. Hopefully that drop is slowing. I do think we'll see overall growth in residential construction, some challenges on multi, but I think single is and will bounce and then we'll see growth on the public side. So a little bit early to call 2025, flurry thoughts would be kind of low-single-digit with no impact from price. Keith Hughes : And that's assuming normal weather. Tom Hill : I don't know what normal is anyway\u2026 Keith Hughes : Whatever normal is? Tom Hill : Yes, yes. Keith Hughes : All right. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Tom, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Wake Stone, just kind of how long you've been looking at that business and maybe the profile, the assets in terms of kind of the per unit profitability, how it sort of stands up against a larger company. Just any other details you could share? Tom Hill : Yes. We've known the brand for years and they run a good company. We looking at closing that business later this year, so not much of an impact, I would say, for this year. They operate in the triangle region of Eastern North Carolina, the Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, and that's one of the 10 fastest growing regions in the country, so a great market. I had the pleasure of meeting with the entire Wake Stone team a few weeks ago. They're a talented bunch and we look forward to them joining the Vulcan family. We are confident that this will have substantial value creation for our shareholders. And I think we're like our strategy, we will say this is expanding our reach into some very attractive aggregate markets. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. Is there a rough estimate of tonnage or should we wait for that? Tom Hill : Historically, they've been in the 8 million to 9 million ton range. Anthony Pettinari : Got it, got it. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Kathryn Thompson : Hi, thank you for taking my question today. You touched on earlier in the Q&A about the volumes down 10%, yet, you were able to get double-digit cash gross profit per ton in the quarter. And you helped us bridge how this is achieved. Following in on that, compare and contrast what happened this quarter and in terms of what your outlook is in 2025 and are there any particular aspects, including cost, that could be different in 2025 versus current quarter? And then maybe also talk about what will be unchanged and what are the things that allow to put up double-digit cash gross profit per ton, even in space of double-digit volume declines. Thank you. Tom Hill : Yes. I think this kind of goes, that, that is the disciplines of the Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating and that's kind of simply put, you saw us continue pricing disciplines throughout this year. And I thought the teams did a good job with that. I think that they did a good job with mid-years, which helps us carry good momentum into 2025 from a pricing perspective. And then the conversations that we've had for the January 1 pricing, they're not complete, but they're pretty far down the road. And so that gives us some confidence of that high-single-digit from a pricing perspective. On the cost side, we've been sitting here facing double-digit cost, unit costs for a number of quarters now, which quite candidly is extremely high. A lot of that is inflation driven. Some of that this year is impacted by weather and by volume. But I think that our operating teams continue to execute on the disciplines from an operating perspective. And that is plant availability, throughput, tons per hour, tons per man hour, and all the metrics that go into what drives cost. So while we continue, I think good pricing momentum going into 2025, I think we are starting to see our cost increases moderate and that's a combination, I think of inflation moderating but also our operating efficiencies improving. And as far as those operating efficiencies, I think we got a long way to go. We were I guess put back a little bit this year because of inclement weather which gives you wet sticky material, it's hard to operate. So I would expect over the next few quarters that to the operating efficiency to continue to improve. Kathryn Thompson : Great. Thanks so much and best of luck. Tom Hill : Thank you. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning, Jerry. Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi, good morning, Tom, Mary Andrews, Mark, congratulations on the strong unit profitability given the volumes this quarter, mind as well. I want to ask the pricing sequentially I thought was quite constructive given the disruption in terms of relative to an attractive part of your footprint here. Can you just talk about how the weaker volumes this year are impacting the pricing cadence, if at all? I'm assuming new spot market business would have come online were it not for the demand decline. And how does that impact the planned pricing cadence in terms of the price increases that you've announced to customers for January 1 for 2025 compared to the cadence of pricing actions that you took in the beginning of 2024 just to calibrate us? Tom Hill : Look, demand, I mean volumes going down never helps price. But I think that the visibility to coming demand both on the public side, particularly on the public side, but now also we think some growth on the private side and residential are helpful for price. I think as far as you know, we talked about mid-year price increases that's a good up for 2025. It helped a little bit in 2024. I think if you look at the cadence in 2024, we were probably up a little bit higher from Q1 and Q2 than last year, probably not quite as high from Q2 into Q3, but that's just timing. And so I think that you put all that together where demand has been a drag I think is us and our customers look to 2025. I think the future looks much better from a public side and from a residential side and probably not as bad from a non-residential side. You pull that together. I think we're encouraged by opportunities for price and unit margin as we look out to 2025. Jerry Revich : And sorry, Tom, can you comment on the timing part of that question, January 1 versus April 1? How does that look in terms of your plans for all compared to the -- Tom Hill : Yes. The vast majority of our prices will be January 1. I'm trying to think if there's any, there will be April. I'm sure there's a minority out there, but none that I can think of right off top of my head. So we -- that's changed -- been changed now for two or three years, and I don't -- I expect to continue January 1. Mary Andrews Carlisle : And just Jerry, talking about the sequential price, you're right. We thought that third quarter sequentially played out in line with what we expected, given the execution on the mid-year increases. So good momentum moving into the fourth quarter, which obviously we don't usually see sequential growth that too much mix really to call that, but tremendous momentum moving into 2025 and those January 1 increases. Jerry Revich : Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning. Brent Thielman : Hey, thanks. Hey, good morning. Thanks. Tom, I know a lot of attention on the private sector for 2025 and what may come, but on infrastructure, I mean, I know some of the leading indicators out there showed some flattening at relatively high level. Guess my question is, do you think your business can still see an acceleration in those volumes next year? I know you've got the weather stuff this year, but also just thinking about a lot of projects that are just still getting going that have been released over the last couple of years. So wanted to get your sense around that. Tom Hill : Yes. I think we feel good about the public side. I think we're seeing the IIJA and state and local funds flow into highways now. Overall, we see public demand growth. It's -- this year similar to our expectations, steady growth as we look forward. And then if you look over beyond IIJA, you've got substantial state funding. Texas and California are two of our largest states and they're at record letting levels. And then you got Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, South Carolina, that all approved large additional funding, state funding. You put all that together, it'll impact some lettings in 2025, which will help us, but it'll go past that. So you got six of our largest states at record funding levels and that should support public demand this year, next year, and obviously the next three or four years. And then you've got the other infrastructure over beyond highways to support by IIJA that is a little better than we would have expected at this point. So feel pretty good about the public side. Brent Thielman : Very good. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Phil Ng : Hey, guys, how are you doing? I guess, from a cost per ton standpoint, how should we think about the fourth quarter? Does that start to normalize? And we look out to 2025; your gross profit per ton has been pretty stellar, despite weaker volumes, does that accelerate a little more, as we get a little more volume growth as we think about next year in terms of cost per ton coming down as well? Tom Hill : I would expect, simply cost -- the cost increases to start moderating. But I think if you -- despite the volumes and the weather challenges that we had in the quarter, we continue to moderate that cost looking backwards and that we stick on material hurts that efficiency. So volume growth in a more normal weather pattern, coupled with the continued implementation of the Vulcan Way of Operating, I think will help our cost issues as we move forward and support that double-digit margin growth. So simply put it, I would expect our cost pressures to start easing over the next few quarters. Phil Ng : Can we get it back normal, like in that low to mid-single-digit range in the fourth quarter or it's going to take a little longer? And is that a good basis for 2025? Tom Hill : That's a great target. But that's the target. I'm not paying in victory on that one yet, but yes, that's our goal is to get it back down to normal. Phil Ng : Okay. All right. Super. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Hi, Timna. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning. Hello. I wanted to ask, if I could, about capital allocation, just shifting gears. So you paused the buyback, wondering why given such a strong free cash flow the quarter. You talked about more M&A. Is there still some left? I know you accentuated that on the last call. And just wondering in general if you can talk about other uses, including debt paydown potentially into next year with a maturity in the second quarter? Thanks. Tom Hill : So I'll let Mary Andrews go first with capital, and then I'll talk about acquisitions. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. Timna, I think through the first nine months, our capital allocation decisions have been consistent with what we always communicate, which is the biggest gating item for us is always growth opportunities. We've obviously announced the Wake Stone opportunity and the pipeline remains active. So I think there's other opportunities ahead of us. We obviously have the balance sheet well-positioned to fund those growth opportunities. And also, as you mentioned, are taking into account the notes that are coming due in April of next year. Tom Hill : On M&A, I think we saw us close a couple of small bolt-ons in Alabama and Texas earlier in the year where obviously, we're excited about Wake Stone, and looking forward to closing that one. That aside, I think the M&A pipeline remains active. We're working on some other opportunities that we hope to get to the finish line and talk about in the next few quarters. Timna Tanners : Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Hey, Mike. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Mary Andrews. Good morning, Mary Andrews, Mark, and Tom. Tom, back to looking maybe at the private sector, can you maybe share how your manufacturing, industrial energy customers, how their plans, their back -- how your backlog looks relative to that market? And have you sensed any maybe generally, maybe definitely on the private side, across the board, any hesitancy because of the election and once that gets through? And with maybe rates certainly hopefully normalizing though the market is not cooperating in the last couple of weeks of that giving you a little more better tailwinds to some of the volume numbers that you're sharing with us today? Tom Hill : Yes. I think, obviously, the warehouses and distribution centers and the like that have been challenges. That being said, I think the drop on that is easing. And as you said, it's offset with heavy and heavy manufacturing and data centers that's been a good tailwind for us. That continues to be a good tailwind for us going into 2025. But I think it's insightful about what you said about what's in the pipeline. I think there's a lot of projects on hold. If you talk to a number of our customers and the large general contractors, they're bidding a lot of work, but nobody is pushing the button. I think that with election being over, interest rates easing, hopefully in the second half of next year, we'll some -- see some of these come off the sideline. But there is a lot of pent-up out there that's kind of a wait and see. So we hope that a number of factors helps ease that, and we see some of that come off. Second half of -- that will impact second half of 2025, but probably a bigger impact on 2026. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Tom. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Hey, good morning. Tyler Brown : Hey, Tom, I want to kind of come back to some prior comments. But where are you all on the plant technology journey that you talked about at the Analyst Day? And what do you think that those efficiencies mean increasing cost call it, disinflation perspective over the next couple of years? I mean, does it shave a point or two off of those unit costs? Just any way to frame it? I'm just trying to understand just how idiosyncratic it is bolt-on. Tom Hill : It's insight -- your insight -- your -- what your question is a cycle because it's a big deal for us. We're still pretty early stages. I think we probably have that fully implemented in 25%, 30% of our operations. The capital cost is spent on the remaining operations. Remember, it's about the top 110, 120 plants which is about 70%, 75% of our production. What we're seeing out of that is double-digit throughput improvements on the plants where it's fully implemented. Long ways to go on that one. I think we make that journey throughout 2025. The weather probably didn't help us with some of that stuff and some of the distractions we have with storms, but I think that Pruitt and team are making good progress there, and I think they'll get that done sometime early 2026. And it's hard -- really hard to call. And we spent some time trying to do it. What is the dollar impact for us? And I think we quit doing that and we'll concentrate on what's the throughput impact because we know its degrees of goods. So -- we'll hopefully finish that journey by first or second quarter of 2026. But you are correct; it will have an impact on our cost. Tyler Brown : Excellent. Yes, that\u2019s extremely helpful. Thanks. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead. Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning, guys. Tom Hill : Good morning. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Good morning. Adam Thalhimer : I'm still a little fuzzy. What do you want us to plug in for volumes in Q4? And then Tom, how much demand variability are you seeing by state? Tom Hill : So on Q4, if you give me the weather report for November, December, I'll give you the volume for Q4. It's just -- it's a hard one to call because it's so dicey. Like I said, October started off slow, but bounced really good. And it's been dry in October, and we shipped appropriately well. But November, December, we all know what can happen in those. So kind of a hard one to call. I would call you to underlying demand for the year is at that probably mid -- down mid-single-digits. We've seen some balance of that in October. But again, it's how many shipping days that we have. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. And Adam, I think overall, our volume guidance from the second quarter was minus 4% to minus 7%, and that's still what we expect for the full year on a demand environment, like Tom described, is down mid-single-digits and the rest of that weather impacted. So where we fall within that will depend on how fourth quarter plays out. Tom Hill : I'm sorry. What was your second question? Adam Thalhimer : Demand variability by state. Tom Hill : That was hard to call because who get washed out -- who got washed out what month this year. But I think all of them are okay. I don't see the -- Illinois has been a challenge with the public side, more of a challenge than most of our states. I think Virginia has had its share of challenges. Northern California has been challenged. And the rest of them, I think, kind of in that low to mid-single-digit rate down of what we've seen, so. And the Southeast is probably healthiest. In Texas, when if you look at Texas, when it quit rain, we should actually shipped quite well, but they got boiling out in the first half of the year, but the second half has been better. But I think most of them are consistently kind of down in that mid-single-digit except for the challenged ones I would call out would be Northern California, Illinois, may kind of Virginia area. Adam Thalhimer : Got it. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning, Mike. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Follow-up on Wake Stone, so I appreciate the volume comment. Can you help us understand just how pricing looks both in terms of kind of where you stand -- where that business stands relative to your core portfolio? And also just how their pricing strategy has looked over the past couple of years relative to the strategy you employ and what you can do with that? And then if I could sneak one more on Wake and just any sense of kind of the cash outlay to close the acquisition? Tom Hill : So you probably don't love my answer, but that's -- as you know, that's a new market for us. We've not been in that in the Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill market before. So kind of new ground from a commercial perspective. So -- and we've got to get it closed. So a little bit early for me to make any calls how we operate -- how they operate today or what we would do differently, if anything, in those markets. So that was -- let me get it closed. Let me get a little digested, understand the markets, and we could be -- give a much better answer on that. As a practice, we don't typically disclose purchase price of acquisitions that aren't material to the company. So again, give us a little time on these things, and let's get it closed, and we can be a lot clear on Wake Stone. We are like I said, very excited about this. We're excited about the team, the Wake team, who we think is very talented. We're excited about the assets and we think the markets are a good addition to that Southeastern footprint and in markets where we can be a leader in the market. So excited about it, and we'll have to get back with you a little more information when we can after we close it. Mike Dahl : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Angel Castillo : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe I wanted to expand on that conversation a little bit more. As you think about more high-level kind of competitive pricing dynamics across your markets, just what are you seeing from maybe kind of the private side of competition in terms of being disciplined on price? And what does that kind of tell you about the price disparity of potential acquisition opportunities versus your corporate level? Tom Hill : It's hard for me to really comment on competitors pricing. Obviously, we get information about markets. But I think that as people look at the aggregates business, they understand the value of the rock in the ground and that's a depleting asset and you shouldn't give it away because you can't replace those tons and people understand that they got to make a return on investment, whether that's the private side or the public side. So I think that the pricing in the aggregates business is -- has always been good and will continue to be good. And I think the onset of growing public demand and potentially growing private demand only helps that situation. Angel Castillo : Very helpful. Thank you. Tom Hill : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tom Hill : Good morning. Michael Feniger : Yes. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in guys. Just Tom, if you could just talk about, I mean, a few years ago, you guys had a target of $11 to $12 cash gross profit per ton on a much higher number of tonnage you're kind of doing today. So just -- how should we kind thing about that as we're starting to close in on that figure? How are you guys kind of thinking about that? And now that we're moving into next year, it looks like we're going to be starting to see some volume increase or at least to end these volume declines. Tom Hill : Well, the short answer to that we got to give you new goals. We reached a lot faster than what we thought we would have. My hats off to my division presidents and all those division employees who accelerated that, that target a lot lower volumes than I would have expected, particularly in the face of, as I said, seven or eight quarters of falling demand. They just have done a good job, and they've executed on the Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating. But the short answer is, we owe ourselves and you do goals because we're basing down that $11 right now, and we plan on getting some of those new goals in the not-too-distant future. Michael Feniger : Great. And if I could just maybe squeeze one more in. I'd love to get a sense, Andrews, just on -- for next year, maybe just moving pieces for free cash flow. Obviously, CapEx has done some acquisitions. Just kind of how to think about that as we're moving into 2025, some of the buckets there in terms of working capital or CapEx in next year. Thank you, everyone. Mary Andrews Carlisle : Yes. Mike, obviously, in February, we'll give full 2025 guidance and include a lot of the things that you just mentioned. But specific to CapEx, we believe we've been reinvesting at appropriate levels for the current business needs. If you look over the last five years, that's ranged 8% to 9% of revenues. As Tom said, we don't even have the acquisitions closed yet. So I don't have a specific view on what CapEx will look like for the acquired operations next year. But as you model, I think that our historical level is a reasonable place to be. Operator : It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional remarks. Tom Hill : Thank you for your time. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. We hope that you and your families are safe and healthy during the holiday season and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
