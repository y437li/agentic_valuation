Morgan Securities Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies Operator : Good morning everyone. My name is Debbie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt McGrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McGrew, you may begin your conference.

We are also joined by Steve Rales, our Chairman of the Board. Given last night\u2019s announcement on the CEO transition, our earnings calls can be slightly different format here this quarter wherein Steve will open with a couple of remarks on the transition before getting into the details of the quarter and then the Q&A.

Lawrence Culp : Matt, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to say a few words about the announcement we made yesterday regarding the CEO succession. Next year, marks my 25th anniversary with the company with more than half of that time as President and CEO. I\u2019ll be in the fortunate position next year of having 14 years in the CEO saddle, while yet still shy of my 52nd birthday. Although many CEOs do not serve this long, I am sure last night\u2019s news comes as a surprise for many of you not because of my tenure, but because of my age. I am convinced in my head that it\u2019s the right time for a transition, both for Danaher and for me personally. This decision is mine. So let me answer the obvious question, why? It\u2019s pretty simple actually, after spending half of my life with this great company, I\u2019d like to do something different in the next chapter of my life. Danaher today is strong, I think you see that in our results and we have every conceivable strategic degree of freedom in front of us. The team is strong and Tom is the right person to be our next CEO. I\u2019m a life-long student of Thomas Jefferson and have always been struck by the wisdom of what he has written about the benefits of revolution every twenty years or so. So while I don\u2019t anticipate a revolution per se at Danaher, I do take a fresh look of free swing to be a value to the company. That said, this decision is hard on the hard. I love this job and more importantly the people with whom I get to work every day. I will miss them greatly. So many of you have asked so what I am going to do. Well, after this call, I am going to go back to work. We have a lot going on and there is much I want to do before next March. First, Tom, the rest of the team and I will be working closely to effect the smooth Danaher class transition. In turn, I am looking forward to spending more time in some areas of real interest to me, particularly education and perhaps even teaching. I am also keen doing some things with my family with the 24/7 nature of this job to make difficult. And I am hopeful that I will be able to bend the rod more regularly than I had in recent years. But good bye to the long way off today. So let me stop there and hand it over to our Chairman, Steven Rales for a few comments before we discuss the details of the first quarter. Steve Rales : Thank you, Larry and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to begin by saying that the Board fully endorses everything that Larry has just said. He has done an outstanding job to this company for 24 years and in particular as CEO during the past 13 years. As most of you know, we will be sorry to see Larry eventually move on, but we respect his personal decision and are fully confident we will have a smooth transition just as we did with our two previous CEO transitions. As all of us well know, Larry has been instrumental in driving Danaher\u2019s success. Just a few highlights. Revenues I have watched them grown from about $4 billion to nearly $20 billion while our market cap has grown from under $10 billion to more than $50 billion. Shareholder returns of five times that of the S&P 500 index since Larry took the rings. Our annual revenue and high growth markets has increased ten-folds from less than $500 million to now $5 billion and free cash flow has exceeded net income every year of his tenure. At the same time. Larry has played a central role in expanding the Danaher business system and is building Danaher into a science and technology company. He has also developed the deep and talented management team that is ready to take on new challenges. Larry is the first to acknowledge that there is always more work to be done, but mean time, Board and management recognizes his many achievements and we thank him for his (Inaudible). Fortunately, Danaher has a history of developing strong managers and Tom Joyce is ready to become our next CEO. Tom has spent 25 years with Danaher and in 53 still has plenty of runway ahead of him. He has succeeded throughout his career and challenging assignments in all parts of Danaher. Tom is a superb strategic thinker with strong operating and people skills. He is currently responsible for our water quality, life sciences, and diagnostics platforms which collectively represents $9 billion of annual revenues. He help shape the current portfolio with the acquisition and integration of many of Danaher\u2019s leading brands including Beckman Coulter, AB SCIEX and ChemTreat. He is also a seasoned teacher and practitioner of DBS and has played a key role in enhancing many of the tools and metrics upon which DBS is built. All of us have great confidence in Tom\u2019s ability to lead Danaher to execute on our strategic priorities and in turn with the supporting cast and 65,000 plus associates create significant value for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call back to Larry to talk about earnings. Lawrence Culp : Happy with that Steve, thank you. We are off to a good start in 2014 and our team\u2019s execution a function of our commitment to the Danaher Business System show better than expected top-line growth, outstanding margin expansion and solid earnings performance in the quarter. We saw positive impact to DBS across our portfolio for the acceleration of new product introductions and go to market initiatives help drive mid-single-digit growth or better and a broad range of our operating companies including Hach, Gilbarco, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct, Videojet and Esko. This strong growth coupled with our solid cross-management by the team led to core operating margin improvement of more than 125 basis points in four of our five segments. So with that as a backdrop, let\u2019s move to the details of the quarter. This morning we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.81, up 8% and representing another record first quarter for Danaher. Revenues for the quarter grew 5% to $4.7 billion with core revenues up 3.5%. The positive impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, which was partially offset by negative currency translation of 50 basis points. Despite the headlines, high growth markets remained strong increasing at a high single-digit rate. China grew approximately 10% led by our Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics and Dental Platforms. Latin America and the Middle East both grew at a double-digit rate and India was up high single-digits. The developed markets grew at a low single-digit rate as both the U.S. and Europe grew low single-digits. This mark the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Europe. Japan sales increased at a double-digit rate. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 52.6% and gross margin expansion along with the productivity and efficiency initiatives made in 2013 has allowed us to grow our investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Core operating margin expanded 100 basis points with reported operating margins at 16.9%. On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus and in the first quarter we deployed approximately $160 million on five bolt-on acquisitions to further strengthen our competitive positions within our Test and Measurement and Environmental segments. We also increased our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share in February. With a healthy balance sheet and robust acquisition funnel, we remain confident in our ability to deploy more than $8 billion in M&A capacity. Turning to our five operating segments, Test and Measurement revenues grew 2% with core revenues up 1%. Core operating margin expanded 125 basis points and reported operating margin increased 20 basis points to 22.1%. Core revenues in our Instruments platform grew low single-digits. Fluke core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate for the second quarter in a row led by demand for Industrial Test products in China and Europe and calibration products globally. Next month, we are launching Fluke Connect, a collection of 20 fluke tools that wirelessly connect to a smartphone app allowing maintenance technicians to capture, store and share data on mobile devices and in the cloud using data captured in our analytical software, technicians will now be able to quickly and proactively address problems with critical equipment before it fails. We have also closed on the acquisition of Unfors RaySafe, a global leader in testing devices, software and systems for diagnostic imaging equipment. Unfors complements Fluke\u2019s existing offering of biomedical testing products. At Tektronix, core revenues declined slightly, as solid growth in Latin America and the Middle East was more than offset by weakness in U.S. military and government verticals. Core revenues from our Communications platform grew low single-digits as strong demand for mobile network monitoring and enterprise network analysis tools was partially offset by weakness in network security. At Fluke Networks we introduced the LinkSprinter network tester and cloud service, a pocket-size tool that allows network specialist to view emails store and analyze your test results on smartphones or in the cloud. Revenues from new products such the LinkSprinter have increased 20% from the comparable amount in 2013 and now represents nearly a quarter of Fluke Networks\u2019 total sales. Apart from evolving to take full advantage of the tremendous opportunity may possible by today\u2019s computing and communications technologies, both Fluke Connect and Fluke Networks\u2019 LinkSprinter launches are examples of that shift and provide our customers with the ability to not only perform complex testing but to access, analyze and act on critical information in real-time. Moving over to our Environmental segment, revenues increased 6% with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points, while reported operating margin was up 30 basis points to 18.9%. Our Water Quality platform\u2019s core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate led by a double-digit increase in the high growth markets. Hach had another strong quarter led by double-digit growth in service and healthy municipal demand in Europe. During the quarter Hach expanded its product line with the acquisition of BioTector, a global provider of online TOC or Total Organic Carbon analyzers that monitor water quality and help reduce waste primarily the petrochemical and food and beverage industries. At Trojan, we received IMO type approval for our full suite of UV ballast water treatment products in early March. With this approval our team can now see the opportunity to help customers who have been waiting for an IMO approved ballast water solution. Importantly, our testing was performed at a U.S. certified lab which provide us with an advantage as we seek U.S. type approval in the next stage of the regulatory process. We believe Trojan low energy requirements, small footprint and ease of use differentiate our solution and position us to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity. Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues increased mid-single-digits led by point-of-sale and payment solutions globally and strong dispenser demand in Western Europe and China. Our comprehensive product suite continues to differentiate us in the marketplace and GVR was recently voted the best POS system and fuel dispenser manufacturer by the Petroleum Marketers Association of America. In life sciences, and diagnostics, revenues grew 6% with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points and reported operating margin was up 50 basis points to 13.2%. Core revenues in our Diagnostic platform grew at a low single-digit rate. At Beckman Coulter, core sales were up led by healthy demand in the high growth markets. Beckman continues to strengthen its competitive position with first-quarter wins in North America exceeding those made during all of 2013. This marks Beckman\u2019s best quarter since the acquisition and expanding its install base. We also achieved an important milestone on the regulatory front receiving closure of the last two FDA warning letters at our Chaska and Miami facilities. Earlier this month, Beckman expanded its world-class automation capabilities with the introduction of the UniCel DxH Connected Workcell. This scalable work flow management solution enables our hematology lab customers to connect up to three analyzers to a slide maker stainer, increasing efficiency and reducing turnaround time for each critical test. Radiometer\u2019s core sales increased high single-digits as we continue to benefit from our growing install base of acute care instruments. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better for Radiometer. Demand was strong across all platforms with core blood gas sales up high single-digits. High growth markets remain robust led by China and the Middle East each of which grew over 20%. Sales at Leica Biosystems were up mid single-digits led by mid-teens growth in advanced staining and digital pathology. Core histology revenues decreased mid single-digits impart due to a large project shipment in the prior year. During the quarter, we received FDA clearance for the Leica BOND Oracle HER2 IHC System on the Leica BOND-MAX. This HER2 test is used to help determine the appropriate treatment for breast cancer and in combination with the speed and efficiency of the BOND-MAX provides patients with quicker access to important test results and treatment plans. Our life sciences platform had a good start to the year. Core sales increased mid single-digits with all major geographies contributing to the growth. AB SCIEX core sales grew high single-digits as strength in the clinical and academic markets drove double-digit growth. Earlier this month we expanded the capabilities of our mass spec offerings in clinical settings with the release of a newborn screening assay for use on the 3200MD IVD system in Europe. This assay allows labs to detect metabolic disorders in newborns more accurately and more efficiently than traditional diagnostic tests. In our separations business, we launched the CES IMS which helps our customers more accurately predict the efficacy and reduce the time to market for pharmaceuticals. Leica Microsystems core sales were up mid single-digits with growth in most major product lines. Geographically, high growth markets grew double-digits with sales of Japan up more than 20%. Dental had an outstanding start to 2014 with the investments we\u2019ve been making in new product development help drive excellent top-line and operating margin performance. Reported and core revenues grew 6% representing the segment\u2019s best quarterly performance in three years. Both core and reported operating margin increased 170 basis points to 14.8%. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental meeting in February, we were excited to announce the formation of the KaVo Kerr Group, which strategically unites our leading dental consumables, equipment, hi-tech and specialty brands, under one global platform and get our brands at the scale they need to better drive innovation, improve clinical outcomes and simplify workflows. Both customer and end-user reception since the launch has been very positive. Dental Consumables core revenues grew mid single-digits with broad based demand across all major geographies. Orthodontics, professional consumables and implant revenues all grew mid single-digits or better. During the quarter Kerr launched the SonicFill Dental composite system in China and Japan further expanding the products\u2019 global application. SonicFill is the only solution that enables clinicians to perform cavity restoration in posterior teeth, with an easy-to-use single-step Sonic activated handpiece. SonicFill has already been a tremendous success around the world with more than 4 million sets shipped worldwide since the initial launch in the middle of 2011. Dental Technologies core revenues also increased mid single-digits with solid demand for our suite and imaging products. At the Chicago Midwinter Show we launched more than 20 new products including the DEXIS CariVu, a portable imager that pairs with our software and uses illumination technology to better assist doctors in identifying lesions and cracks in teeth. And finally the Industrial Technologies\u2019 revenues grew 4.5% with core revenues up 3% and core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22.5%. Motion platform core revenues improved sequentially from the fourth quarter, but still declined at a low single-digit rate. Strong sales in North American distribution was more than offset by a weak defense market and the impact of exiting certain lower margin product lines. We expect to complete that transition in the second quarter. We remain really pleased with the team\u2019s execution on operating margin which increased more than 200 basis points from the prior year. Our Product Identification platform core revenues were up mid single-digits with growth across most major geographies. Videojet\u2019s growth was balanced with mid single-digit growth in both consumables and equipment. During the quarter Videojet launched the 8610 thermal inkjet printer, world\u2019s first TIJ printer specifically designed for fast drying ink enabling customers to print high resolution codes on non-porous surfaces, four times faster than other inkjet technologies. At ESKO, our suite of packaging management and design software grew double digit as the need for more efficient solutions across packaging workflow continues to build. ESKO remains the workflow management software provider of choice for brand owners with sales increasing more than 30% in this market. So to wrap up, we are off to a very good start in 2014 as our teams\u2019 execution drove better than expected revenue growth, outstanding margin expansion and solid earnings performance. The Danaher Business System has helped build momentum across the portfolio by driving continued share gains and funding increased growth investments. We believe this momentum along with our robust balance sheet and confidence on the acquisition front position us well in 2014. We are initiating second quarter diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.90 to $0.94 which assumes core growth comparable to the first quarter. We are also reaffirming our full year 2014 diluted net earnings per share guidance of $3.60 to $3.75. Matt McGrew : Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Debbie, we're ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll go first today to Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Hi, good morning guys. Lawrence Culp : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Congrats Larry on a great run. Also, just having the guts to make the decision, I mean, a lot of guys would sit around and kind of milk this job for a while. Obviously you are not doing that, so congrats. Lawrence Culp : Thank you, Scott. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Is there any risk, I mean, how do you avoid with the change in 12 months out, I mean, how do you avoid 12 months of inertia here? How are guys going to think about deals? As this increase your \u2013 I mean, how does it change? I would be kind of awkward I think to announce the substantial deal and that passed on to Tom at this juncture. But is that the wrong way to think about it? Lawrence Culp : Scott, I understand the concern, but I think that\u2019s the last way we would think about it. Tom and I have worked together for 25 years. We have been both partners for over a decade. So I think that on the M&A front, Tom begins to be more a part of that conversation as we think about identify and cultivating pursuing targets. We wouldn\u2019t chase anything at this point that Tom wasn\u2019t fully brought into. But we do not slow down here at all in terms of what we want to do from an M&A perspective. I think that we got the time here to effect operationally, organizationally a very smooth transition and I am exceptionally confident that Tom, Dan, the rest of the team and I are going to be able to work together as we always have over these next several months during transition. Tom of course will be spending time with businesses that he doesn\u2019t know as well, getting up to speed on some of the CEO duties that will be his come mark, but from an M&A perspective, I think it\u2019s very much business as usual. And I have to go back \u2013 if you go back to my first year as CEO, I\u2019ll never forget my first Danaher Leadership Conference where we announced three deals that week. So there is think precedent and confidence to suggest here that the transition no way will dilute or impede our activity on the M&A front. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, fair point and I don\u2019t know if Steve Rales is still there available for questions, if he is, I thought to ask one if he is available. Lawrence Culp : He is here Steve \u2013 he is here Scott. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, great and Steve, I mean, I guess, my question for you is, when Larry took over as you said it was a $4 billion revenue company, now it\u2019s a $20 billion company, so substantially more complicated and quality is definitely a lot higher sure, but how is the mandate for Tom change, how \u2013 stepping into a, he is filling the seats of a guy who just had a five-bagger in market cap and 13 years that\u2019s a pretty tough shoes to fill. I mean, how does the mandate for Tom change? How does the Board think about how this company grows from $50 billion of market cap to something that\u2019s acceptable to shareholders in that same timeframe? Steve Rales :  Thank you, Scott. I think the conversations about longer-term strategy and capital allocation are regular subjects to the Board. This is the Board that\u2019s not unfamiliar with either of those. We'll examine the market as we always do. We have lengthy conversations with Larry, Tom, Dan and the rest of the team and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities as we have for the last 25 or 30 years. We think it\u2019s an exciting runway ahead, we\u2019ve never been into better position from the balance sheet standpoint and I think there are plenty of opportunities that will be very exciting and I expect shareholders at the end of the day will be winners as a result. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, fair point. Thanks, Steve. Congrats Larry and good luck to Tom. Pass it on. Steve Rales : Thanks, Scott, we\u2019ll do. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : Hey, good morning. Lawrence Culp : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : Congrats Larry. I echo with Scott\u2019s comments. Lawrence Culp : Thank you very much. Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : How are you guys looking at the macro environment and maybe if you could just talk about specifically what\u2019s going on in China and in Europe? Lawrence Culp : Sure, I think that we were pretty pleased from a geographic perspective with the way things played out. Just maybe a word on the U.S. we saw \u2013 like a number of companies a slow start to the year, particularly in businesses where getting out every day is important whether that be on the diagnostics side all the way to \u2013 but we really, we are encouraged by the building strength during the quarter and the way we exited the first quarter and even way we\u2019ve begun April here. Europe, third quarter in a row being positive, admittedly it\u2019s up in low single-digits but that\u2019s too has been encouraging just given the history. Our European leadership conference was held just two weeks ago and the mood there, Steve was buoyant as it\u2019s been in several years. So we are optimistic there particularly with respect to life sciences, the dental side of things and TID our oral health position in Europe. China, clearly lot of headline concerns there. But we are pretty pleased to see double-digit first quarter with a bit better balance between our healthcare businesses which in the last few years have really led the way. Dental was up over 20%, LS&D up about 10% with the industrial businesses also doing better particularly in the environmental round. So we are going to watch China carefully, some of the other high growth markets that\u2019s why we said back in December we thought the gap between the high growth markets and the development markets might narrow a bit that play out for us here in the first three months. But still very much the high growth markets in the pole position. So we like what we saw broadly around the world in the first quarter. Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : And in the April you said, April was, how good as kind of April started and are you kind of assuming that do you know falls off here in the second half and you are consistent guidance for the second quarter, is there a comp issue in the second quarter with some similar organic? Lawrence Culp : No, I think \u2013 we are really talking about a comparable core in the second quarter mindful that it\u2019s still relatively really in the year, obviously a host of concerns out there in terms of the macro theme. I think if we look at the way the first quarter played out, we knew we were hurt by one less selling day particularly in consumables and probably helped a little bit given the Japanese tax dynamics. I suspect they wash, while we were thrilled with how strong dental Hach, VideoJet life sciences were relative expectations. We did have a choppy start in T&M, particularly in \u2013 and that's a space both with some of the mobile carriers and with some of our larger enterprise customers we want to watch carefully. So, I think comparable to the 3.5 we rung up here in the first quarter feels about right but we really like the exit rate in March and while it\u2019s just a couple of weeks I\u2019m encouraged by the start here in April. Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : And then, one last question. Larry, I know you are probably, this is probably a dumb question, but I guess, in your mindset, are you still of the mind or you may spend some time with your family or this is kind of \u2013 do we take this you are kind of done with the large public company digs, I mean, are you going to take and are you kind of retiring? I mean, politics, have you thought about what the next step is at all, should we be surprised to see you resurface at another public company in a few years or it\u2019s probably like you know a tough question answer obviously at this stage? Lawrence Culp : But thanks for asking it. Steve, you know I am very fortunate given the great run that we had for a long time here that there probably hasn\u2019t been a large public job that hasn\u2019t been floated my way in the last six, seven years. But you see where I am. This is a great job. Tom, he is a lucky guy to have that opportunity here in a while. My view is, I am going to be full speed up until March 1 and then I am going to be in advisory capacity doing anything and everything that Tom wants me to do including get out of the way. But I am genuine and serious about wanting to do some other things. So while I would say never say never, I think I\u2019ve had a pretty good job here and in this realm, it will be tough to be. Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : Okay, congrats to Tom by the way too. Lawrence Culp : Thank you, Steve. Operator :  We\u2019ll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Yes, thanks good morning. Hate to sound repetitive, but congratulations Larry. And f you decide on politics I think the government could use some DBS methodologies. So, you think about that. Lawrence Culp : Thanks, thank you Nigel. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : So, it sounds like March was stronger than Jan, Feb and it doesn\u2019t feel like the weather had a big impact on your organic performance. I am wondering the impacts on consumables with equipment and whether that dynamic had any impact on your margin improvements during the quarter and how that maybe \u2013 shake up by segments? Daniel Comas : Sure, Nigel. This is Dan. Good morning. Consumables were up 4% during the quarter which has been pretty consistent, maybe 50 basis points lighter than what we saw in the second half of last year. I think you could really explain that entirely by the one less selling day. I think what was really encouraging during the quarter was the equipment side. We were up 3.5%, that is the best number we posted in a number of quarters, balance stability it was the first, as Larry alluded to, better breadth in China. It\u2019s the first quarter in a long time that all five segments were up in China. Healthcare was up more than industrial but again seeing some footing there. We were up 100 basis points in terms of core margin expansion. Some good improvement there, do we make a little bit more money on consumables and equipment we do but it didn\u2019t really seem to impact margins at all during the quarter. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then just going back to the \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a pretty healthy debate on capital deployments, PE seems to be pretty active, pushing up multiples to some pretty high levels. A lot of public companies that are out there saying they want to do more M&A. I am just wondering, is the environment tougher to deploy capital and then maybe just turning to that as well, what is the message on dividends? You obviously increased as four folds during the quarter, still a lot low in terms of pay out. But what is the message on dividends? Lawrence Culp : Nigel, let me speak to M&A, maybe Dan will talk a bit to dividends. I think from an M&A perspective, there is no question that the environment given valuations first in the public market and the spillover effect in the private markets has been more challenging in the last couple of years, I think we have acknowledged that. But fortunately given the breadth of our portfolio and the inventory of markets we have an interest in, we don\u2019t have to buy market indices, right. All we are really looking to do is identify and invest in discrete companies which we think are great fits with the Danaher portfolio and it\u2019s really from that perspective that we are out talking to a lot of people really across the entire corporation about opportunities that we think would be glove fits for Danaher and for DBS. So, different environments are challenging in different ways, I don\u2019t think that they \u2013 that we see private equity even with their resources being a primary competitor for us. It continues to be rare for us to see PE as the competition around an asset that we might cover. Clearly, the last several months have had some situations where we\u2019ve been mentioned in combination with private equity, but largely around assets where our interest was partial not full. When we have strong interest in an asset in its entirety, I think we have great confidence in our ability to carry the debt. Dan? Daniel Comas : Nigel, on the dividend, it\u2019s like the increase we know it\u2019s still relatively modest, it represents at $0.40 a share would represent about 10% of our free cash flow per year. So we are not trying to signal anything there. The strong bias is still very much M&A and expect that to continue. But it does create another vector to return some capital to shareholders. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, thank you very much guys. Lawrence Culp : You bet, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Larry the accolades are going all year, I'll just echo them. We\u2019ll miss you. Lawrence Culp : Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Good luck. I just want to come back again, maybe, approach M&A again to the question that Steve Rales is still there and to take another one. You have kind of unique position with your involvement with full effect also obviously and they do seem to be able to get that done over there. And I guess it does brings the question, is it simply a law of large number of dynamic that has come to bear as it relates to Danaher? Is there a need eventually to revaluate the portfolio or think of a new leg to open another vector for capital deployment? Do you think a question of size only has the ability to kind of perpetuate the business model? Steve Rales : Thank you, Jeff. But first let me say yes, I am a shareholder of Colfax Corporation, full stop. Second, going back to what we talked about earlier, our Board has a very long view and our objective is to continue to try and find the way along with the management to make our businesses better and add value for shareholders. It\u2019s an evolving process. It\u2019s an ambulatory process. We are constantly looking at M&A, there is a certain vicinity if you will to the law of large numbers but we think more about opportunities and making our businesses better. Truthfully, Larry and Dan do a very nice job of communicating the company\u2019s view on M&A, so I would defer to either them on the question. Lawrence Culp : Jeff, I would just add that, we really don\u2019t think beating a $20 billion revenue based company, a $ 50 billion market cap in anyway get in the way in terms of doing M&A. I think it\u2019s just the opposite. At every step along the way as we\u2019ve gotten bigger and in terms stronger, we\u2019ve had more degree to freedom, we\u2019ve had more \u2013 more capacity to do the things that we think really build an outstanding company over time witness Beckman Coulter. If you look at the way we\u2019ve run M&A on a daily basis, it really starts with all the strategic platforms which would be great mid cap companies all by themselves if they were stand alone entities and it\u2019s really that family of mid-cap companies working their market\u2019s funnels around competitors, distribution, technology, bolt-ons that maybe of interest in addition to the adjacencies which give us the bulk of our flow around the smaller transactions that you see. The team here in Washington, which I think is outstanding. It\u2019s really the group that targets the new space with the larger situations which naturally are going to be less frequent and at times more meaningful decisions this year amount of capital deployed. So I don\u2019t think that while we have great respect for Steve and the team at Colfax, we don\u2019t really think that there are lessons there that will help us deploy the next eight plus billion in capital we intend that will build out our companies. Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : All right, fair enough. Just a quick one for Dan if I could. You did get a number of small deals currently in the first quarter, can you give us an idea of how many transactions were in there and what the average valuation was? Daniel Comas : Jeff, we closed five acquisitions in the quarter which was an increase and we are seeing actually an increase around small deals which hopefully will be a positive sign about potentially getting something bigger done. Spend about a $160 million so relatively modest. A mix, some of those are businesses that are relatively low margin today, but it will come in as bolt-ons or create opportunities on the margin side, so those are all situations where we think we can get a 10% return, exceed 10% within three years. Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : All right, thank you very much and good luck Larry. Lawrence Culp : Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll still be around a while. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co: Thanks, good morning and obviously, I\u2019ll echo that congratulations Larry, fantastic. Lawrence Culp : Thank you, Steve. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co: So, hey, since you are a student of Thomas Jefferson, I can\u2019t help, but recite one of his quotes right delay it\u2019s preferable to err on the capital deployment side, you didn\u2019t say that second part, but, it\u2019s a great quote and I understand that sort of how you are thinking about it. Is that $8 billion still the right number, I should be thinking about? Daniel Comas : Steve, it\u2019s Dan. I mean, clearly if you look at the balance sheet, the breadth of our, the quantity of our free cash flow, you can pencil out a larger number that until we obviously get some deals done aside, I think we will stick with the $8 billion. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co: Okay and Dan while I\u2019ve got you, since we are in this period where M&A is a lot smaller in terms of reviewing the portfolio right now, the \u2013 where can ROIC go and I am just assuming that there is a continued delay for a little bit of time and how do you see ROIC kind of playing out in that event? Daniel Comas : Well you\u2019ve been seeing at 50 to 100 basis point increase in annual ROIC, given that we\u2019ve had fewer acquisitions. I would be happy to see that stop for a little bit. We\u2019d bring in some larger ones but, I think if you look at Q1 I think representative of last year, up 3.5% core growth and earnings up 8% we are getting I think good relative performance on the top-line and good margin expansions along with it and that's obviously increasing our overall returns. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co: Okay and sir if I could add one more just on the earnings side, the dental strength that you guys had was a surprise to me anyway. What do you really attribute that to? Is it sort of product, market, or what can you identify kind of that and give us a sense for the sustainability, or you just think it\u2019s sort of a lumpy demand and we just have to be like this quarter? Lawrence Culp : Steve, I think if you look both at the consumables versus technologies divide as well as the look around the world, the strength was very broad based. I don\u2019t think they continue at that rate. We did get a little bit of help from Japan given the VAT increase. But it was once said dental is a mid single-digit grower, strong imaging and digital franchises and technologies, and while they are rarely home run products in consumables we had a wonderful wave of products launched at Midwinter. The team continues to execute better both in the U.S. and in Europe while China clearly is a concern for a lot of folks, our dental business continues to do very well there. So, again I think we probably come down a little bit from what we saw in the first quarter but dental ought to continue to be a contributor to it for us as we go through the year. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co: Okay, great. Thank you. Lawrence Culp : You bet, Steve. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura. Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities : Good morning guys. Lawrence Culp : Good morning Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities : Congrats Larry. Great job and really happy for you. Good luck with the next part of the journey but we will have you around for a while. Hey, you mentioned, speaking it being around for a while, you mentioned wanting to get some things done before you leave, I mean, are there any sort of big things on that checklist that you think you want to make sure you get done before you hand it off? Lawrence Culp : I\u2019d like to write a few more checks before I go. Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities : Okay, so, it\u2019s mainly M&A focused anything other than that sort of that internal initiatives or other things that you feel like you want to bring to posture now? Lawrence Culp : Well, I think a lot of our internal initiatives are around the high growth markets, around what we are doing in terms of taking full advantage of the web, what we are doing increasingly at a platform and regional level is work that we won\u2019t finish when Tom hands. This is the work that Tom and I and the rest of the team has been engaged in together for some time. Tom and I will be dividing and conquering over the next year and that\u2019s where I\u2019ve been focused and we\u2019d expect to continue to be focused. Clearly, getting the team ready as well, as they assume the new and additional responsibilities will be part of \u2013 of where I\u2019ll be focused. But also just making sure that Tom's ready. I can vouch now from experience that this is one of the more meaningful transitions that you have as an operating leader. Tom is more than capable, but we want to make sure he is just tuned all the way up come March 1 to be ready to go as I know he will be. Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities : Okay, thanks. And then, you\u2019re seeing some of these other encouraging trends across the businesses/ where do you think the tech instruments business is at this point? You had some of this military government pressure that\u2019s one vertical, but maybe talk across the others and where do you think that is and what\u2019s it going to take to get going? Lawrence Culp : Well, I think that we will take this stability that we are seeing in some of the larger tech verticals like computers, communications, semi and alike. The broader distribution business has actually been decent, but again because of the gov dynamics particularly in the U.S. here at the start of the year which we saw \u2013 I know some competitors have spoken to, puts us in that flattish zone. We\u2019d like to thin k we see a little bit of an uptick from there but don\u2019t anticipate necessarily a pronounced spring back at Tektronix through 2014, but gradual improvement. Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities : Okay, all right thanks a lot guys. Lawrence Culp : Thank you, Shannon. Operator : We will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Congratulations. I just had a quick question on broader one test and measurement really. If you look at the organic growth in that segment, the last ten quarters, it\u2019s about 0.5%. I just wanted to know something with the portfolio you needed some major work in \u2013 or it\u2019s just a function of sluggish macro factors? Lawrence Culp : Julian, thank you. Relative to your question, I think you really have to look at the segment in two halves, the communication platform has really been a nice performer for us, particularly around the mobile networks build out that we\u2019ve been a large part of. We think that opportunity that challenge is to keep up with the explosion in bandwidth demand that we are all generating which will be with us for a while. Soft start to the year in network security, but as you know the last couple years, that\u2019s been a strong performer for us and we are optimistic that it will return the type of performance as we go through the year. But on the instrument side, Fluke has had a tough goal of it, particularly in places like China where there is the slowdown in the industrial factor has been particularly pronounced. At Tektronix we just spoke to that a moment ago with Shannon, I think those dynamics are well known. But we are encouraged by Fluke here putting up another quarter of positive growth. We really like these new products that are coming out and a review just last week with the commercial team I really liked what I saw in terms of the launch plans for the second quarter and the second half. So while Fluke is unlikely to be a high single-digit grower for us any time soon we think we get Fluke back here to a more normal low to mid single-digit range as we go through the course of the year and while tech will be challenged we build on that stability and hopefully get them back to growth as we go through the year. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great, thanks and then life sciences, the last couple of years, each year you had large expansion about 150 BPS each year, Q1 was up 50 BPS, life science is larger, is that kind of the run rate going forward just because I guess most of that savings is now been squeezed out? Daniel Comas : Julian, we were \u2013 core margins are up about 75 basis points in the first quarter. So there was a little bit of acquisition noise. Life science was stronger than diagnostics, and again I think diagnostics, their shipments were up low single-digits that was \u2013 we believe largely impacted by one less day. If you look at their orders, they were up mid single-digits. So I think that\u2019s encouraging. That creates a little bit of negative mix just because if the incremental sales of consumables is at higher margins. So I think you will see continued very good margin performance and expansion in the segment. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks, Dan and just lastly on the CapEx, I think you talked before about low mid single-digit CapEx increase this year, Q1 was up lot more than that. Do you change the full year or it was just (inaudible) Daniel Comas : Well, it\u2019s coming up in part because of increased placement at Beckman, because of our leasing model. That shows up in CapEx. So some of the increase in CapEx is less traditional PPV, it\u2019s actually expanding our installed base at Beckman which is obviously a good sign for the business. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great, thank you very much. Lawrence Culp :  Thanks, Julian. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen, we will take our final question today from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies:  Thanks, good morning. Lawrence Culp : Good morning, Brandon. Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies: Larry, could you elaborate on what you saw from an order perspective at Beckman understanding weather and one less selling day were headwinds, but given your comments about win rates in the U.S. when do you think that we see that translate into a core revenue inflection in the Beckman diagnostics unit? Lawrence Culp : Well, I think that, we did a bit better from a bookings perspective and again better in bookings than we did in shipments. But the trend through the quarter was positive for us in that regard primarily with consumables but that North American equipment comment that we made, we think it\u2019s significant, because it\u2019s really the combination of so much of the work the team has done the last several years. As you know, it will take a while to get those orders converted into new boxes on the floor and in turn see that consumable stream. But we think that as we move forward sequentially through the course of the year that we will see a pick up as a result of those as increased wins here in North America, done unlike what we are sitting already in terms of early benefits from the return of the component to our whole suite of analyzers. So it will be gradual, I wish it was more rapid, but we will take the early indicators here of progress and then we can build on the print through the course of 2014. Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies: And then just one for Dan, operating cash flow is a little soft even excluding the discrete factors from last year. What\u2019s your operating cash balance for the year and how quickly would you expect the timing dynamics from the first quarter to normalize? Daniel Comas : I think, you are seeing on an improvement here in Q2 as Larry alluded to given the stronger shipments in March relative to the first few months that hurt us a little bit from a timing perspective on CapEx but I think that will shortly reverse itself. Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies: Okay, thank you. Daniel Comas : Thanks, Brandon. Lawrence Culp :  Okay, thanks everybody. We are around all the day for you to take follow-ups. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference.",

With that I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Larry. Larry Culp : Matt, thanks. And good morning everyone. Our team executed well in a modest growth environment in the second quarter. Revenues increased 3% and were largely consistent with what we have seen over the last 12 months. Geographically, high growth markets led the way again as we saw continued strength in China and Latin America. The developed markets were up low single-digits, with growth in the U.S. as anticipated and Western Europe slightly below our expectations. During the quarter the Danaher business system helped many of our businesses accelerate new product introductions and enhance our sales and marketing teams\u2019 effectiveness. These efforts, combined with go-to-market initiatives in high growth markets drove share gains of Hach, ChemTreat, Implant Direct, Leica Biosystems, AB SCIEX and Radiometer. On the capital allocation front, we\u2019ve been encouraged by the increase in our acquisition activity. Since the beginning of April, we\u2019ve announced or closed 10 acquisitions totaling over $1 billion, including four deals greater than $100 million each. These acquisitions will strengthen our existing businesses in the Environmental, Dental and Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. Just last night, as many of you may have seen, we announced Beckman Coulter\u2019s pending acquisition of Siemens clinical microbiology business, a leader in automated diagnostic solutions that help healthcare providers identify infection causing bacteria and determine the best course treatment. This transaction is our largest in over two years. With our robust balance sheet and a healthy acquisition funnel, we remain confident in our ability to deploy our more than $8 billion of M&A capacity. So with that in the backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported another record second-quarter for Danaher. Diluted net earnings per share were up 9% to $0.95. Revenues grew 5% to $5 billion, while core revenues were up 3%. The impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 1.5%, while currency translation had a positive impact of 0.5%. Our second-quarter gross margin expanded to an all-time high of 52.8%. With this increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage, we were able to boost or investments in sales and marketing and R&D by approximately $85 million, while improving core operating margins by 45 basis points. DBS helped us deliver strong cash flow performance. Our operating cash flow was $1 billion and free cash was $844 million. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio for the quarter was 125%. Turning to the five operating segments, Test and Measurement revenues were flat, while core revenues declined 2%. Reported operating margin contracted 250 basis points to 18.4% and core operating margin decreased 155 basis points, primarily due to the decline in our high gross margin communications platform. Our Instruments platform core revenues were flat for the quarter. At Fluke core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, marking the third consecutive quarter of positive core growth for the team. Orders grew mid-single digits with solid point of sale demand in North America and China. During the quarter we launched Fluke Connect, a collection of 40 wireless enabled test tools that allow technicians to analyze, share and store data online and in the cloud. We also introduced several new tomography products including the Ti90, and 95 thermal imagers. These imagers feature higher resolution than other entry level models and come standard with Fluke Connect. Orders for both Fluke Connect and the Ti90 and 95 imagers have already exceeded our expectations.  Tektronix core revenues declined low single digits as modest growth in the U.S. military and government sales was offset by weak demand for our video products and a decline in technology spending in Asia. We were encouraged however by our order growth during the quarter, which was positive for the first time since 2011. Core revenues in our Communications platform decreased at a low double-digit rate as a decline in network monitoring more than offset growth in network security solutions and installation tools. As expected, our network monitoring business was adversely affected by delays in wireless carrier spending, which we now believe will also result in negative growth for the platform for the rest of the year. At Arbor, demand for our network security solutions remain strong with orders increasing more than 20%. Arbor is recognized as the leading security solutions vendor among both enterprise and service providers and was named best overall IT company in the 2014 Hot Companies and Best Products awards in June. Environmental revenues increased 6% with core revenues up 3.5%. Core operating margin expanded 40 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 21%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our Water Quality platform core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate, led by strong demand for our analytical instruments and chemical treatment solutions. Hach had another solid quarter with high single-digit growth in China and healthy municipal spending in both the U.S. and Europe. Hach\u2019s investment in digital marketing and online distribution hit a major milestone this quarter as our U.S. Web site generated $1 million in weekly sales for the first time ever. At ChemTreat we saw robust demand for our chemical solutions in both North America and Latin America. You may recall from our Analyst meeting in December that ChemTreat is focused on expanding in Latin America and has increased sales and in the region four fold over the last four years. During the quarter, ChemTreat acquired Chile based Aquasin [ph], a leader in industrial water treatment instruments and services which will further accelerate our growth by expanding our localized product offerings in South America. Gilbarco Veeder-Root\u2019s core revenues grew low single digits, led by healthy demand for vapor recovery products in China and point of sale solutions globally. Also contributing to the strength was Insite360, our cloud-based platform that allows retailers to remotely control there retail automation and environmental monitoring systems across multiple sites from any PC or mobile device in real-time. Customer reception has exceeded our expectations with more than 100 retailers adopting Insite360 in June alone. During the quarter, GVR completed the acquisition of ANGI Energy Systems an innovator in compressed natural gas fuelling design and engineering. Compressed natural gas alternative energy solutions are being rapidly adopted, particularly in the truck stop market and we believe ANGI will be able to take advantage of Gilbarco Veeder-Root's leading presence in that space. In Life Sciences and Diagnostics we had an excellent quarter, with top line growth in operating margin expansion. Revenues for the quarter were up 7% while core revenues grew 5%. We also increased our investments in sales and marketing and R&D nearly 10%, while still expanding operating margins by 145 basis points. The Diagnostics platform continued its solid performance with mid-single digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales grew at a mid-single digit rate with double digit growth in immunoassay annual analysis. Geographically high growth market demand remained strong led by mid-teens growth in China, while the developed markets grew at a low single digit rate. Importantly, the U.S. was up low single digits, marking our first quarter of growth in the U.S. since the acquisition. We believe our higher customer win and retention rates in the U.S. and around the globe are the results of our team\u2019s dedication to regulatory compliance, better service, reliable quality and on-time delivery. The team has also made significant progress driving efficiencies, improving operating margin by over 150 basis points year-over-year to their highest level since the acquisition. Additionally, Beckman Coulters first made their bolt-on acquisition IRIS, which closed in October 2012, delivering double digit growth and expanding operating margins over 1000 basis points in the quarter. So we\u2019re very excited last night to announce Beckman\u2019s second sizable bolt-on acquisition of Siemens\u2019 clinical microbiology business. Siemens microbiology produces highly accurate automated instruments and consumables that help hospital and research laboratories identify infection causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments. Notably these solutions are capable of detecting the bacteria\u2019s resistance to specific drugs, helping doctors to proactively plan the best treatments with their patients. With over $200 million in revenue, this acquisition represents an attractive opportunity for Beckman and the rest of the diagnostics platform and we will spend our already strong presence in both hospitals and reference labs. We believe the Danaher business system will help Siemens microbiology enhance its workflow automation solutions and develop go-to-market collaboration strategies with our other Diagnostics businesses. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in early 2015. Radiometer\u2019s core revenues grew high single digits, with growth in all major product lines and Q2 sales were particularly strong, increasing over 40% in the quarter. At the EPG conference in May, we highlighted the many ways in which our platforms harness their scale to enhance growth and augment individual operating company strengths. Within Diagnostics we have seen terrific results from this collaboration as Radiometer utilized Beckman Coulters commercial capability in Turkey, South America and United Kingdom to secure large project orders. At Leica Biosystems, sales increased at mid-single digit rates, led by high teen\u2019s growth in the high growth markets. Advanced staining grew mid-single digits, as our increasing install base of BOND instruments grow solid consumables growth. Aperio, our ePathology business grew double digits as doctors increasing look to provide more accurate, more secure cancer diagnostics for their patients. Our digital work flow solutions facilitate global collaboration between doctors and other experts, simplifying the process of developing precise diagnosis and treatment plans. Our Life Sciences platform core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate. AB SCIEX core revenues were up high single digits, driven by strength in the academic and applied markets in both North America and Europe. We believe our investments in new products have helped increase our market share over the past several quarters. At the American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting in June, we launched several innovative new products, including the TripleTOF 6600 and the 3500 Triple Quad. The 6600 enables scientists to obtain results 10 times faster than traditional methods. In combination with our SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software, it is the only system on the market that provides a complete workflow solution for proteomics research. The 3500 is an easy to solution that provides laboratory a reliable and accurate way to insure food safety and environmental compliance. With the introduction of these products, we were able to meet the needs of researchers across a broader spectrum of disciplines, experience levels and price points. Leica Microsystems core revenues grew up low single digits with strength in North America, Western Europe and Latin America. Sales of our Confocal microscopy products increased over 20% in the quarter led by robust demand for our flagship SPA product line. Turning to Dental, segment revenues grew 2.5% with core revenues up 2%. Core operating margin declined 55 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 14.8%, due to both weak consumable sales and our continued investments in new product development and commercialization in high growth markets. During the first half of the year, our core operating margin in Dental increased 50 basis points. Over the last decade our Dental platform has evolved from a collection of individual business to a unified group of market leading equipment, consumables and specialty brands. At last month\u2019s Analyst Day in California, the team did an outstanding job highlighting that evolution as well KaVo Kerr Group\u2019s unique position within the Dental industry and how we use DBS to drive growth and innovation. For those of you unable to participate, I encourage you to watch the replay, which is available on our website. Dental consumables core revenues grew low single digits as robust growth in our implant business augmented modest increases in our other businesses. During the quarter, we acquired Ducks, a leading -- a leader in restorative and infection control consumables. Ducks nicely complements Kerr\u2019s portfolio and broadens our range of offerings to general practitioners, dental specialists and hygienists. We also expanded our presence in high growth markets with the acquisition of Reinor Orto, one of Ormco's longstanding South African distributors. Dental technologies core revenues increased low single digits driven by a healthy demand in high growth markets, particularly China, which grew more than 25%. Our expansive of range of imaging products delivered excellent results, growing mid-single digit in the quarter. Notably our focus on innovation in imaging has helped us build a growing install base of more than 6,000 3D imaging units. In addition, at our Analyst Day, we discussed publically for the first time another element of our digital dentistry roadmap, our chairside computer aided design and milling solution. This digital system will enable dentists to custom design and manufacture crowns, fillings and custom implant abutments in their offices in just minutes, significantly reducing the amount of doctor time and patient office visits required to complete a dental prosthetic procedure. This is a great example of how the KaVo Kerr Group works together to meet customer needs as it will use Ormco\u2019s Lythos digital impression system, i-CAT\u2019s treatment planning software and KaVo\u2019s ARCTICA milling machine. Turning to Industrial Technologies, revenues increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 3.5%. Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points while reported operating margin increased 30 basis points to 23.8%. Motion platform core revenues increased at a low single digit rate led by project wins in the high growth markets. This marks the first quarter of growth for the platform since the fourth quarter 2012. With our transition out of lower margin businesses largely complete, motion is now more profitable and better positioned for future growth. Core revenues of our Product Identification platform were up low single digits, as solid growth in our inline variable printing and packaging solutions globally was partially offset by a decline in our laser marking business. Videojet grew to mid-single digit rate, led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables in Europe and the high growth markets. During the quarter, we expanded our coding applications offerings with the launch of the 9550 print and apply labeler. This product\u2019s breakthrough design controls a label from printing to placement, eliminating everyday operational problems such as label jams, mechanical adjustments, worn out parts and failure points. Esko continues to strengthen its leading position in packaging and workflow solutions with sales increasing mid-single digits. In May, Procter & Gamble chose Esko as an official strategic partner to provide hosting and implementation of our Automation Engine and WebCenter solutions. Automation Engine and WebCenter combine to provide a powerful web based platform that helps brand owners and print professionals manage all aspects of the packaging design workflow. Also during the quarter, we hosted the highly successful EskoWorld\u2019s Conference, where over 400 customers participated in 70 workshops on topics ranging from brand management to 3D package design. So to wrap up, our team executed well in a modest growth environment, delivering top line performance consistent with the past four quarters. The Danaher Business System continues to help us as we invest in growth, drive share gains, expand margins and improve free cash flow. We believe our robust balance sheet, continued focus on organic growth opportunities and confidence on the acquisition front will drive solid performance in the second half of 2014 and beyond. So today, we are initiating third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.86 to $0.89, which assumes core growth comparable with the growth rate seen in the first half of 2014. We are also narrowing our GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full year to $3.67 to $3.72 from the previous range of $3.60 to $3.75. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Larry. That concludes our formal comments. Tina, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We will take our first one from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis - Barclays: Trying to get my arms around the margin numbers and you mentioned dilution from deals a number of times. But it didn\u2019t seem like there is a lot of deals \u2013or at least there is a few -- I mean at least material deals. I guess my question is why weren\u2019t the restructuring actions of kind of a year ago plus DBS and such able to offset the dilution from the deals and maybe just some granularity into when you think about the margin movement, what part of that was deal dilution and what part of it was mix or anything else that might have impacted? Larry Culp : Scott, I would say that on balance we were actually pretty pleased with the performance in light of the volume. As you see here with core up at 3%, it camouflages a little bit some of the stronger performance we saw in three of the five segments and we had some real standout businesses with water, certainly diagnostics, very pleased with Beckman Life Sciences\u2019 Videojet. It\u2019s a pretty healthy list there. And I think on balance, having three to five segments up 40 basis points in terms of the operating margin expansion and particularly with LSD, Life Sciences and Diagnostics up nearly 150 basis points, a lot to attribute there to DBS, the restructuring you alluded to and the like. I think the long and the short of it is, is we\u2019ve kind of looked at it, and I don\u2019t mean to suggest we\u2019re in any way content here. We had two businesses with high variable margins that finished softly, more softly than we would have anticipated there in June. We saw some softness in the U.S., in dental consumables sellout that in turn impacted our June there at Kerr particularly. But mainly, and the big issue is it -- Tektronix Communications, the big carriers were soft here in the quarter, far softer than we thought. And we have particularly high variable margins there. Now fortunately Arbor and Fluke Networks, our security and enterprise businesses were actually pretty good in the quarter, but it was really isolated in that regard. And when we have that sort of revenue with those sorts of margins breaking away from us late in the game, it doesn\u2019t help on the top, but it really does for the bottom all in. Dan Comas : And Scott just regarding the acquisition, we talked last year, we had about $100 million of restructuring spend generating about $20 million a quarter of savings or we had $20 million -- approximately $20 million of acquisition expense in the quarter. A lot of that's non-cash. You\u2019ve seen an increase in the number of deals and from a GAAP perspective, not from a cash flow perspective, we\u2019re feeling the impact of that on the margin. Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay. That's really helpful. And then as a follow-up and you think about 3Q guidance, I\u2019m not surprised you\u2019re being conservative, but at the same notion, when you think about Life Sciences and Diagnostics being kind of back in the game, core growth 5% good and that seems, I\u2019m guessing that's somewhat sustainable for the rest of this year and then you made some positive comments about the order rates, particularly in Fluke and your comps are still pretty easy next quarter. Why wouldn\u2019t the core growth accelerate sequentially from here? Larry Culp : Well, I think that as we look at the third, I think both from a geographic perspective, Scott, and from a segment or platform perspective, what we saw in the second right now was probably what we\u2019re going to see in the third, which is why we\u2019re kind of embracing that first half core performance as a good guide here for the third. From a geographic perspective we saw a little bit of a tail in June, tail-off in June. I would say that was modest, but it was broad-based. So we\u2019ve got a watchful eye there. Clearly the U.S., there\u2019s a bit of an offset there both in terms of what we saw -- I think some of macro data out there. But net-net, the developed markets are probably where they\u2019ve been. I think some of our team are probably a bit optimistic in the high growth markets as we go into the third quarter. Brazil\u2019s got some of the noise relative to the World Cup behind it, the Indian Election all of that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re banking a lot on any sort of uptick there. I don\u2019t know if that's conservative, I suspect that's just being pragmatic. So we get that core there in line with the first half. We get similar margin performance, in part because the Tek Comms dynamic is going to be with us through the second half. It\u2019s probably going to cost us a couple of pennies a quarter as they are resolved. We will work hard to offset that. We\u2019re not happy with it, but it is what it is. And I think when you put all that together, you get the formal guide that we\u2019re offering this morning. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : So just obviously homing in on the test and measurement weakness, and it\u2019s been weak in sort of third year [ph] of (indiscernible) growth and I\u2019m just wondering Larry, can you gave some perspective on how much of this is structural and how much confidence do you have that these businesses can return to an acceptable growth going forward? Larry Culp : Yes. I think you have to break it down by business, Nigel. And I realize at a high level, may be some of the details don\u2019t matter so much. But at the operating level, I think we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing at Fluke. Three quarters in a row here of growth is certainly something we can all I think appreciate. I think what we\u2019re particularly encouraged by is the combination of the new products and Fluke Connect I think is a game changer for them, but also the improved commercial execution around the world. I\u2019m not sure that Fluke\u2019s ever going to be our highest growth business, but can they be a consistent low to mid-single digit grower for us? More so than we have seen in the last couple of years, I believe so, and I think they are building momentum here, very much in that direction. I think Tek as we\u2019ve talked many times, has a different end-market set of drivers there. Technology spending broadly, including spending on the bench has been muted the last several years far more than we would have anticipated. But there again I think the order books are firming up having first positive quarter in years there. Hopefully it\u2019s the beginning of a trend. I think Fluke will in all likelihood outperform Tek in the near to medium-term. And that\u2019s I think is straight as we can call it. I think within Comms, we\u2019ve been very fortunate to be part of the mobile network build out at Tek Comms. It\u2019s been a what a mid to high single-digit grower for us double-digits in many quarter and what we are seeing right now is a delay broadly with a number of those same customers which we think is more timing than anything else. But it\u2019s clearly going to put pressure on us as it did in the second quarter and in second half, and I think we continue to be bullish about that business long-term. And it\u2019s a business that\u2019s well complemented at the platform level by both what we do a security with Arbor and what Fluke Networks does with the enterprise customers. So three different stories, if you will, I think on balance, still good ones but we need to build on the momentum at Fluke and Tek to have a better second half to help offset some of this pressure we know we are going to see in Tek Comms particularly in the second half. Nigel Coe : Okay, good. That\u2019s very helpful Larry. And just to clarify the -- you talked about very clearly about the pressure in the -- demand trend is going to keep Comms negative for the backlog for the year, just want to clarify that with Comms not be wide at T&M segments? Morgan Stanley : Okay, good. That\u2019s very helpful Larry. And just to clarify the -- you talked about very clearly about the pressure in the -- demand trend is going to keep Comms negative for the backlog for the year, just want to clarify that with Comms not be wide at T&M segments? Daniel Comas : That\u2019s correct, and we expect to -- our Comms platform which was down double-digit in the second quarter, can be down high single-digits, double-digit. In the second quarter we expect instruments to get a little better so we don\u2019t -- we printed down a couple of points here. I think we will do a little bit better than that, but probably not much. Operator : We will take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa :  Just on the third quarter guidance. Is there something that\u2019s getting unusually kind of weaker there? I mean, is there anything other than the kind of the tail-offs and maybe in June you said it was kind of broad-based? Maybe if you could just put a little more color around that tail-offs. Because, I mean if I am doing the low-end of the range it gets you actually below 24% other year, modestly below that I mean I haven\u2019t seen that from you guys in the last couple of years. I think so just a straight map on the seasonality would suggest something that\u2019s a few times higher than what you guys have put out there. So is there something seasonally even adjusted for the $0.02 from this quarter? Is something seasonally there that is weaker than expected? JPMorgan:  Just on the third quarter guidance. Is there something that\u2019s getting unusually kind of weaker there? I mean, is there anything other than the kind of the tail-offs and maybe in June you said it was kind of broad-based? Maybe if you could just put a little more color around that tail-offs. Because, I mean if I am doing the low-end of the range it gets you actually below 24% other year, modestly below that I mean I haven\u2019t seen that from you guys in the last couple of years. I think so just a straight map on the seasonality would suggest something that\u2019s a few times higher than what you guys have put out there. So is there something seasonally even adjusted for the $0.02 from this quarter? Is something seasonally there that is weaker than expected? Larry Culp : Well Steve, one of the things impacting the guidance in Q3 is the $1 billion of acquisitions that we have announced to close in the last four months. As you know when we did the SCIEX deal, which was about that size, we called that all the one-time stuff which was pretty significant when it got to a $1 billion. We\u2019re not doing that here. So part of the reason we\u2019re taking down the high-end of our guidance is, we are going to have a fair amount of acquisition knowing a lot of it is non-cash as a result of these five larger deals over the last three months. That\u2019s impacting and we had a little bit of that in Q2 but given these deals have just closed -- in the case of Siemens, we are likely not going to close that until the first quarter, but given it is a carve out transaction, Declan is actually going to have to spend a fair amount of money in the second half year to get ready to -- from a systems point of view to bring that business in. We think it\u2019s a very attractive high return acquisition opportunity, but it\u2019s going to hurt us a little bit from a GAAP EPS perspective over the next couple of quarters. Steve Tusa :  How much would that type of spending be? JPMorgan:  How much would that type of spending be? Larry Culp : Well Declan is going to cost them -- it\u2019s going to cost the Life Science and Diagnostics half a cent to a penny in the second half. Add to that the other -- the deal cost, the inventory step-up from the other deal, the other 250 million of revenues that are coming onboard here, we\u2019re going to have $0.03 or $0.04 of additional dilution here that -- again a lot of it is non-cash, but GAAP dilution in the second half. Steve Tusa : Just at a higher level, I guess, do you know you guys are going to be at 3% to 3.5% organic for the year, that\u2019s above the mid-point of the annual range yet, you are kind of guiding at the mid-point. We are talking about some acquisition dilution. There is I guess spending to get ready for an acquisition. Again, I just feel, like in the past you guys have kind of blown through all this stuff. There would be may be some left over scraps from restructuring or some other leverage to pull. I also now recall this kind of lumpy mix creating somewhat of a visibility problem perhaps. I mean does this go to just the more complex nature of your portfolio and where the margins are today relative to maybe four or five years ago I mean this just feels a little bit different than what you guys used to kind of blow through in the past? JPMorgan: Just at a higher level, I guess, do you know you guys are going to be at 3% to 3.5% organic for the year, that\u2019s above the mid-point of the annual range yet, you are kind of guiding at the mid-point. We are talking about some acquisition dilution. There is I guess spending to get ready for an acquisition. Again, I just feel, like in the past you guys have kind of blown through all this stuff.

I mean does this go to just the more complex nature of your portfolio and where the margins are today relative to maybe four or five years ago I mean this just feels a little bit different than what you guys used to kind of blow through in the past? Larry Culp : Steve, I appreciate the question, but the way I would respond to it is that Danaher that you know is the Danaher you got today. And we had a situation in the second quarter that's going to perpetuate itself in the second half. We are business that has been on a literal care for a long time, it\u2019s not going to contribute to the top-line. It\u2019s not that big of a deal, but Tek Comms has been a real contributor to us. But here for the next several quarters, we\u2019re going to miss that revenue, but we\u2019re really going to miss the variable fall through there. And if that wasn\u2019t going on particularly to the level that we have seen and now we anticipate, we wouldn\u2019t be talking about any of this quite honestly. So I think it\u2019s isolated, not happy about it, but it is what it is. But when you look more broadly across the corporation, there are so many good things going on from a segment, from a platform, from a geographic perspective that we\u2019re not going to lose too much sleep here because we\u2019re building a business for the long-term we feel as confident and as consecutive about that as we ever have. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Steven Winoker : So just I want to go back to Nigel\u2019s question on Tek and specifically on Tektronix not on the communications business. So I think this is the 11th quarter of negative growth, you have talked about order growth turning positive finally here after a very long period of time. But I guess I\u2019d still at a more granular level trying to get the sense for what\u2019s structural versus what\u2019s cyclical here. In your sense when you dive into the different pieces, video et cetera and you analyze the business, what gives you a comfort level that actually this is still the good market overtime and that we\u2019re just in the cyclical kind of trough? Sanford Bernstein : So just I want to go back to Nigel\u2019s question on Tek and specifically on Tektronix not on the communications business. So I think this is the 11th quarter of negative growth, you have talked about order growth turning positive finally here after a very long period of time. But I guess I\u2019d still at a more granular level trying to get the sense for what\u2019s structural versus what\u2019s cyclical here. In your sense when you dive into the different pieces, video et cetera and you analyze the business, what gives you a comfort level that actually this is still the good market overtime and that we\u2019re just in the cyclical kind of trough? Larry Culp : Well Steve when you talk about 11 quarters, right, that can be a fine line to draw, but I think we continue to be optimistic about Tek and its market. Again I think we\u2019ve seen, well what we haven\u2019t seen is that bounce back in bench spending that is typically followed every major downturn that we studied in the history of the Company. Things have been grinding here for a while. I think we see that on the part of the global technology customers that we serve really without too many exceptions by vertical and by geography. So our task and our challenge is to innovate as best we can and in the face of that execute as well as we can from a delivery, from a service perspective in the field to drive a sort of new order growth which will lead to shipment growth in time. So, I don\u2019t want to blame it all on the market, we certainly gotten better at Tek over the last several years and what we can control. And I think that combination is what fuels that optimism. But you don\u2019t hear spending in the table because we need to prove it to you with real results on a sustained basis. Steven Winoker : And is this a place, a particular segment that you would continue to seek to deploy capital externally? Sanford Bernstein : And is this a place, a particular segment that you would continue to seek to deploy capital externally? Larry Culp : I think the Tek\u2019s team at Tektronix their primary focal focus here Steve is to grow the business organically. Steven Winoker : Okay. And just maybe as a follow-up, maybe on that 150 basis point decline core and you mentioned the high variable margin on the communications side driving most of that, but can you give me some sense as is all that operating leverage or I\u2019m just trying to break out what went well in test and measurement versus what was really just a function of the volume? Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And just maybe as a follow-up, maybe on that 150 basis point decline core and you mentioned the high variable margin on the communications side driving most of that, but can you give me some sense as is all that operating leverage or I\u2019m just trying to break out what went well in test and measurement versus what was really just a function of the volume? Dan Comas : Instruments OP were relatively flat. OP dollars were flat with core growth that was also flat, so there were obviously do some things on the cost side to overcome sort of in inflation and others, but all the OP decline and all the margin hit was not from the comp side, and that is, of our equipment business that's our highest variable margin business. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : I just wanted to [indiscernible]\u2026 Credit Suisse : I just wanted to [indiscernible]\u2026 Larry Culp : Julian, are you there? Matt Gugino : Operator we can\u2019t hear Julian. Operator : One moment, we\u2019ll take a question from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Hey just a couple of quick ones, does your guide for 2014 assume the Q4 restructuring in the ballpark of what you did last year, I think maybe you were talking 80ish before relative to the 100 as kind of a ballpark idea? Vertical Research Partners : Hey just a couple of quick ones, does your guide for 2014 assume the Q4 restructuring in the ballpark of what you did last year, I think maybe you were talking 80ish before relative to the 100 as kind of a ballpark idea? Larry Culp : Jeff, we are going through our planning process now, we would expect to have restructuring in the fourth quarter. We haven\u2019t pinned down a number yet. Jeff Sprague : And then I know you haven\u2019t been a fan of programmatic share repurchase but what's your thought process on opportunistic share repurchase? Vertical Research Partners : And then I know you haven\u2019t been a fan of programmatic share repurchase but what's your thought process on opportunistic share repurchase? Larry Culp : I think that\u2019s a word we\u2019ve used with some frequency over the years to describe our philosophy with respect to buybacks. Jeff Sprague : And then just thinking about deal valuations, I mean we see what seems as -- what\u2019s kind of ballpark valuation on the other stuff that you\u2019re currently buying? Vertical Research Partners : And then just thinking about deal valuations, I mean we see what seems as -- what\u2019s kind of ballpark valuation on the other stuff that you\u2019re currently buying? Larry Culp : Jeff, so we brought in roughly, if you look at kind of 2015, just run rate, we brought in about a $0.5 billion of revenues over the last four months, not all that close but either signed or announced. And we paid approximately a $1 billion all with one exception which is more of a start-up all profitable businesses, so pretty good I\u2019d say overall EBITDA sort of multiples and situations where we on a deal-by-deal expect to get to a -- exceed a 10% return within three years so I feel pretty good. And we\u2019ve done five deals here between 90 million and 500 million in the last five, over the last three months and feel pretty good about the valuations as well. Jeff Sprague : Do you think something is actually changed or is this kind of the random walk of deals where your, there\u2019s nothing and then there\u2019s something and you can\u2019t time them or do you have some confidence that things are actually picking up on the M&A front? Vertical Research Partners : Do you think something is actually changed or is this kind of the random walk of deals where your, there\u2019s nothing and then there\u2019s something and you can\u2019t time them or do you have some confidence that things are actually picking up on the M&A front? Dan Comas : Again, in kind of what we have seen in sort of the mid-size deals each 100 to a billion dollar type transactions, we\u2019re pretty encouraged by the quality that not only the number of situation but obviously along these lines of this five situations where all things are cheap, we can get deals done under our return parameters. I think we\u2019re still having active conversations on the larger opportunities as well, I think there is a net-net and an encouraging sign here, but until we pull something bigger down, don\u2019t want to sort of declare any victory. Larry Culp :  Jeff, what I think stands out for me, to build on what Dan both in terms of what we\u2019ve announced here and what we think and how we think about the funnels, it is really the breath of these dynamics. If it was in one space, it might be a bit more of a random walk but it is undercurrent is broad-based, I think that\u2019s a good sign and part of the confidence and a conviction we\u2019re reiterating this morning on the M&A front. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. And just finally from me, on this June stay, is that a U.S. comment? Vertical Research Partners : Thanks. And just finally from me, on this June stay, is that a U.S. comment? Larry Culp : No. Jeff Sprague : Is that a global comment? Vertical Research Partners : Is that a global comment? Larry Culp : Jeff, really we were referring to Western Europe. That was one geography that was, if you rolled up our -- everybody came in line with what we thought at the beginning of the quarter. Western Europe was slightly below what we thought at the beginning of the quarter and that was most pronounced, it wasn\u2019t terrible but it was most pronounced in June, a little bit of a tail-off there. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Just on the equipment versus consumables mix, I think you\u2019d called out in Q1 that equipment sales were up, 3.5% the best in a very long time. How did that play out in Q2? Credit Suisse : Good morning. Just on the equipment versus consumables mix, I think you\u2019d called out in Q1 that equipment sales were up, 3.5% the best in a very long time. How did that play out in Q2? Larry Culp : The, it was more or less in line Julian with what we have seen consumables broadly were good, I they led the way. Unfortunately we had a little bit of a lag there in equipment but it wasn\u2019t broad-based, again it kind of comes back to the issue with the -- we flagged earlier around communications with Tek Comms being so soft that was really the major break on the equipment trend that we have seen the last several quarters, otherwise the general mix was very much in line with what we\u2019ve seen fortunately. Julian Mitchell : Got it. And then within just a follow-up on Western Europe, you talked about the slowdown there in June, I guess it seems like it\u2019s very, very short-term, so it\u2019s maybe hard to read too much into it, but I guess is your sense that, it\u2019s more that the, you had expected that to accelerate as we went through the year and it\u2019s just hit kind of a ceiling on growth, or was there actually some softness on order intake below sort of what you\u2019d thought? Credit Suisse : Got it. And then within just a follow-up on Western Europe, you talked about the slowdown there in June, I guess it seems like it\u2019s very, very short-term, so it\u2019s maybe hard to read too much into it, but I guess is your sense that, it\u2019s more that the, you had expected that to accelerate as we went through the year and it\u2019s just hit kind of a ceiling on growth, or was there actually some softness on order intake below sort of what you\u2019d thought? Larry Culp : Julian it was a, we had good growth in context. It just down ticked broadly versus our expectations in that quarter. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to try to extrapolate that too far here too soon, but it is something we\u2019re watching carefully as we start the second half here. Again in part because of, it seemed to be broadly based, as opposed to the U.S. which was strong and where we saw softness at Tek Comms and consumables that was particularly isolated. Julian Mitchell : Got it. And then lastly very quickly, environmentally you talked about weakness in U.S. municipal spend continuing, looking at sort of local government\u2019s finances, those have been improving in terms of tax receipts and so on for 18 months now, when do you think that will start to feed through? Credit Suisse : Got it. And then lastly very quickly, environmentally you talked about weakness in U.S. municipal spend continuing, looking at sort of local government\u2019s finances, those have been improving in terms of tax receipts and so on for 18 months now, when do you think that will start to feed through? Larry Culp : Maybe we didn\u2019t get that right in the script. Actually our muni spend and which has begun to bounce back in Europe and has continued bounce back in the second quarter in U.S. so [indiscernible] had good muni spend in the U.S. in the second quarter. Operator : We will take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs Isaac Ro : On Tek Comms, I just wanted may be one more question on that. Talk a little bit about the product specific trends there and the reason I ask is I think in the past we have talked a little bit about the secular shift towards software and you guys were taking some steps with Arbor Networks. So I am just wondering if there is an element of product innovation there that is factoring into your demand profile and what -- well can you shed light on there, relative to yourselves as well as the competition? Goldman Sachs : On Tek Comms, I just wanted may be one more question on that. Talk a little bit about the product specific trends there and the reason I ask is I think in the past we have talked a little bit about the secular shift towards software and you guys were taking some steps with Arbor Networks. So I am just wondering if there is an element of product innovation there that is factoring into your demand profile and what -- well can you shed light on there, relative to yourselves as well as the competition? Larry Culp : Yes I think as we look at those dynamics, I think we are really talking about specific customers, specific programs and the time they are in and that\u2019s where we enter the quarter thinking that the rest of the year was going to play out in one way. At this point, it\u2019s going to play out in other way and again not a way that is necessarily helpful for us. But these are long-term relationships we feel good about the value that we provide, the function that Tek Comms provides to these mobile operators. So we are going to take the long view and continue to invest in and persevere though it clearly put some pressure on the margins in the near-term. Isaac Ro : Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the healthcare side of the business, specifically Beckman, you guys saw the mid-single digit growth. I am wondering if you could talk a little bit your view on the sales funnel for that business just given the uncertainty with hospital capital budgets around ACA. And as a corollary to that, the Siemens business that you acquired is I think about microbiology, the secular trends there are okay, but not great. So we are just trying to get a sense of your plan to create growth and maybe grow faster in the end-markets in that business? Goldman Sachs : Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the healthcare side of the business, specifically Beckman, you guys saw the mid-single digit growth. I am wondering if you could talk a little bit your view on the sales funnel for that business just given the uncertainty with hospital capital budgets around ACA. And as a corollary to that, the Siemens business that you acquired is I think about microbiology, the secular trends there are okay, but not great. So we are just trying to get a sense of your plan to create growth and maybe grow faster in the end-markets in that business? Larry Culp : Sure. You really have to like a Beckman headline number here in terms of the core and particularly that turn in the U.S. I think the funnels are healthy, but again the funnels are healthy because of the underlying actions the team has really been hard at work and progressing over the last several years. So when you look at those funnels and more importantly the retention wins rates that come as a function of those funnels, we couldn\u2019t be happier. And in turn and then to see those revenues come into the business, because as you know Isaac, we can see 6, sometimes a 12 month lag from the time our customer makes a decision before we can recognize that revenue. I think that the microbiology lab is a good or the micro bio space is a good space. It\u2019s not a space that we\u2019ve been in. And frankly, we\u2019ll take a mid-single growth business with the platform that we will get from Siemens and do there I think what we\u2019ve done like in bio, in radiometer, more recently with the Irish business in urinalysis and really work hard to turbo charge that business. And I think you\u2019ve seen us do that from an innovation perspective, I think you\u2019ve seen us do that with respect to the some of the go to market fundamentals. And that in concert with the synergies we should get from the rest of the diagnostics platform is really the high level game plan that we have for this business ones we get it into Danaher. As Dan alluded to a few minutes ago, it can take a little while as carve outs is not the cleanest integration that we\u2019re going to see. But frankly, given the degree of difficulty at both SCIEX and at Beckman Coulter in the team\u2019s subsequent success we feel pretty confident, they are going to knock this one down in the end. Operator : And our next question is from Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : I guess I have just a question on cash flow. If I look, last year cash flow was relatively flat versus the previous year and I understand why. But it also seems that year-to-date free cash flow once again is relatively flat versus a year ago. And as a company that sort of we look again cash flow basis, A, what\u2019s going on? If there is anything wrong, and if it\u2019s just timing and if it\u2019s just timing, should we expect a pick-up in free cash flow in the second half? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess I have just a question on cash flow. If I look, last year cash flow was relatively flat versus the previous year and I understand why. But it also seems that year-to-date free cash flow once again is relatively flat versus a year ago. And as a company that sort of we look again cash flow basis, A, what\u2019s going on? If there is anything wrong, and if it\u2019s just timing and if it\u2019s just timing, should we expect a pick-up in free cash flow in the second half? Dan Comas : Andrew, it\u2019s Dan, you are right, our year-to-date free cash flow is relatively flat. But as you remember in the first quarter, our year-on-year cash flow was down a fair amount. We thought that was timing we thought that we\u2019d catch up to about last sport by the mid-year. That occurred I think it\u2019s trending well and generated almost 850 million of cash in the quarter versus less than 400 million in the first quarter. I expect that positive trend to continue. Andrew Obin : Terrific and any more color just from printing ID on the short cycle business, anything stems out on a positive and negative side to you in the quarter? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific and any more color just from printing ID on the short cycle business, anything stems out on a positive and negative side to you in the quarter? Dan Comas : Within the product ID Andrew? Andrew Obin : Yes, product ID, yes.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, product ID, yes. Dan Comas : I think the Videojet team continues to lead the way, they are up mid singles. If you look at the last four -- if you look at the last eight quarters, I think we are very pleased both on an absolute and on a relative basis with respect to what Videojet and company are doing. I think Esko slowed down a little bit here but has been a very strong performer for us as well and the noisome that we shared with you relative to Procter & Gamble, I think it\u2019s important as we continue to digitize these packaging design workflow solutions on the Web that really are the major growth drivers for Esko. So I think all-in-all, we are pleased with where those businesses are today. Andrew Obin : But from a macro standpoint, no particular segment or geography really stood out? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But from a macro standpoint, no particular segment or geography really stood out? Larry Culp : Not really. Operator : And we have a -- our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Larry, in Life Sciences, back on your comments around strength in the academic market at AB SCIEX, to be clear, have seen an uptick in the market or that more of a function of better execution in AB SCIEX specifically? Jefferies: Larry, in Life Sciences, back on your comments around strength in the academic market at AB SCIEX, to be clear, have seen an uptick in the market or that more of a function of better execution in AB SCIEX specifically? Larry Culp : I think we are feeling good about the execution there, but it\u2019s probably frankly a combination that is hard to titrate out, one versus the other. Brandon Couillard : Okay, then with respect to the Siemens Microbiology DL, can you give us a sense of how do you see the competitive landscape evolving in that ID/AST arena particularly around NASPEC and other emerging direct from blood technologies. Can you leverage AB SCIEX to launch their own, NASPEC based solution in that market? Jefferies: Okay, then with respect to the Siemens Microbiology DL, can you give us a sense of how do you see the competitive landscape evolving in that ID/AST arena particularly around NASPEC and other emerging direct from blood technologies. Can you leverage AB SCIEX to launch their own, NASPEC based solution in that market? Larry Culp : As you know, it\u2019s a complex landscape, not only in terms of some of the strong and outstanding competitors that we have there but also the competing and evolving technologies. I think, our view particularly with the spectrum aspect is that what we get with Siemens is quite complementary to what happens with NASPEC. We don\u2019t provide the product today from SCIEX, I am sure you know. I think, over time we need to be careful with how many fronts AB SCIEX takes on, because we are seeing broad potential application in NASPEC technologies. We don\u2019t want SCIEX to try to be at all things to all the people, so there will be situations where we have relationships with others that were we may compete in one space and collaborator cooperate in others. And I think that\u2019s very much the creativity and the nimbleness that we are going to need the SCIEX team and the Beckman team is well here to embrace and engage as we go forward. Operator : We will take our final question from Deane Dray with Citi. Deane Dray : Thank you. Just a quick clarification on the guidance for the third quarter, what was very helpful was when Dan added that there was going to be $0.03 or $0.04 of deal dilution in the second half, and I think he said on top of that its half a penny to a penny in the integration cost you will have to do for the Siemens Microbiology. So that\u2019s $0.04 or $0.05 for the second half. How much of that is reflected in the third quarter guidance? Citi: Thank you. Just a quick clarification on the guidance for the third quarter, what was very helpful was when Dan added that there was going to be $0.03 or $0.04 of deal dilution in the second half, and I think he said on top of that its half a penny to a penny in the integration cost you will have to do for the Siemens Microbiology. So that\u2019s $0.04 or $0.05 for the second half. How much of that is reflected in the third quarter guidance? Larry Culp : It\u2019s probably -- it\u2019s about a $0.02 impact in the third quarter and probably a comparable impact in Q4. Deane Dray : So pretty linear, and is it split between what non-cash and cash? Citi: So pretty linear, and is it split between what non-cash and cash? Larry Culp : It\u2019ll be more non-cash. There will be some cash because of the Beckman integration, but I don\u2019t have any more. I don\u2019t have the exact breakdown of that. Deane Dray : Citi: Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Gugino, at this time I will turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thank you. That concludes our formal remarks and Q&A we are around all day for questions. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

With that I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. We are pleased with the quarterly results we announced this morning. Earnings came in above our expectations, thanks to the Danaher teams\u2019 very strong execution. Danaher Business System continues to drive superior margin expansion, increase cash flow and healthy top line performance in a modest growth environment. The investments we\u2019ve made in innovation and expansion in high growth markets drove share gains in many of our operating companies. Fluke, Hach, Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB Sciex, Implant Direct and Esko are among the businesses that we believe outperformed relative to their markets during the quarter. These share gains and the teams\u2019 execution also helped drive more than 85 basis points of core operating margin improvement in four of our five segments. Our cash flow performance is also very good, resulting in free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of a 128%. We are encouraged by our increased M&A activity of late, as we\u2019ve announced $3.3 billion of deals across our portfolio in the first nine months of the year. These acquisition will strengthen our dental, life science and diagnostics, environmental and Test & Measurement segments.  Cultivation funnels across our portfolio remained full, giving us confidence in our ability to deploy our substantial M&A capacity in a strategic and disciplined way. So with that as a backdrop, let\u2019s get in to the details of the quarter. This morning we reported diluted net earnings per share of $0.95, up 13% and representing another record third quarter for Danaher. Revenues grew 4.5% to 4.9 billion, with core revenues up 3%. The positive impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, while currency translation reduced revenues by 50 basis points.  Geographically, high growth markets led the way increasing high single digits. Despite the headlines in China, our businesses grew double digit, led by our T&M Instruments, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics and Dental platforms. Developed markets remained relatively stable and the US and Western Europe both grew low single digits. Our gross margin expanded 80 basis points or approximately a $140 million to 52.7%. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D by nearly 60 million in the quarter and deliver 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion.  Turning to our five operating segments, Test and measurement revenues increased 1.5%, while core revenues decreased 1%, primarily due to a decline in our communications platform. Reported operating margin declined a 170 basis points, while core operating margins decreased a 115 basis points.  On Monday, you saw that we announced an agreement to combine our communications business with NetScout Systems to create a premier global provider of network management solutions for both carrier and enterprise customers. We are excited about this transaction which is the culmination of a multi-year discussion with NetScout about working together. This is a powerful opportunity to combine highly complementary businesses in a transaction that we believe will benefit all Danaher and NetScout stakeholders, associates, shareholders and customers alike.  Danaher\u2019s premier troubleshooting, cyber security, and engineering solutions combined with NetScout\u2019s high performance monitoring technologies will give customers access to the most expansive suites of best-in-class product in the industry. The combined company will offer even greater breadth and depth across both carrier and enterprise networks, expanding opportunity through innovation and growth and improving our customers overall experience. We anticipate that this transaction will close in 2015, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory NetScout shareholder and other approvals. Upon close, our Executive Vice President, Jim Lico will join NetScout\u2019s Board of Directors, while retaining his responsibility to Danaher. Now back to the results from the quarter, our communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. High teens growth in our security solutions business was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions due to spending delays from a wireless carrier customers, primarily in North America. Despite the revenue decline, we were encouraged by the positive order growth in the platform that we believe will continue for the remainder of the year. At Arbor demand for Pravail enterprise security products grew more than 50% as IT Security customers continue to rely on Arbor to prevent and mitigate attacks on their networks. Around the world conducting business has become increasingly virtual, and Arbor is responding with flexible solutions to help customers of all sizes quickly and cost effectively launch or expand best-in-class security solutions. Fluke Network saw robust demand for its enterprise TruView system and portable network tools which were each up 15%. F Net\u2019s TruView system continues to receive industry recognition and we are honored with the 2014 Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award from the global media company, TMC. Our instruments platform core revenue increased at low single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies. Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits representing its highest quarterly growth rate in over three years. Growth was solid across most major product lines, led by calibration and biomedical which each increased double-digits. Distribution [sell-out] [ph] remained strong globally, particularly in North America and China, where growth was mid-single digit or better. Fluke plans to build on this momentum by launching Fluke Connect in China later this month. At Tektronix core sales were up slightly, with modest growth in point of sales in North America and healthy demand for power supplies and oscilloscopes in China. Turning to our environmental segment, revenues increased 10.5% with core revenues up 5%. Segment core operating margin improved 85 basis points with reported operating margin down 30 basis points due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Water quality core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate with strength in analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment solutions. Hach executed well in a temperate municipal spending environment driving above market growth in both North America and Europe. Sales also healthy in China growing double-digits. This month, Hach will launch the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer or PPA, a breakthrough system that dramatically streamlines water quality testing. The PPA system is the only testing solution in the market that uses a disposable cartridge to improve ease of use and reduce the manual steps by over 50% in an EPA compliant drinking water testing environment. Importantly, it provides technicians of all experience levels with a fail safe way to achieve highly accurate and consistent results. In Trojan demand for large municipal projects remain weak globally. Encouragingly, we received two Ballast Water Treatment system orders that will be installed in a total of 15 ships. We anticipate the delivery of these systems will start in the second half of 2015. On the regulatory front, we received Alternative Management System or AMS acceptance from the US Coast Guard for a full suite of UU ballast water treatment product in July, this is a temporary designation that allows customers to use Trojan solutions in US waters, while our application for US type approval is pending.  Gilbarco Veeder-Root\u2019s core revenues grew mid-single digits with real robust demands for our dispensers, vapor recovery products and point-of-sales solutions. Vapor recover sales grew more than 50% in China as businesses continue to work towards compliance with environmental regulations.  In point-of-sale, North American customers are choosing GVR\u2019s reliable and affordable payment security solutions as they operate their systems in advance of the new EMV regulations that begin to take affect in 2015. In the quarter, Gilbarco Veeder Root acquired FuelQuest a leading provider of fuel management solutions for suppliers, distributors and buyers of petroleum products. This acquisition further expands the capabilities of our Insite360 cloud-based fuel management platform by allowing our customers to remotely monitor fuel acquisition, planning and distribution.  Moving to life sciences and diagnostics; revenue increased 4% with core revenues up 3%. Core operating margin was up 120 basis points, while our reported operating margin increased 100 basis points. Core revenues in our diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits.  At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased a mid-single digit rate with double-digit growth in immunoassay, urinalysis, and automation. Growth was particularly strong in China where revenues grew over 20%. Beckman received FDA 510 clearance for its Power Express Sample Processing System in the quarter, further expanding its world-class suite of automation products.  The Power Express is a scalable, high speed system designed to automate sample processing in labs of all sizes across all core disciplines including chemistry, immunoassay and hematology. The Power Express is just one of several new FDA cleared solutions that will help our US customers improve efficiency and reduce turnaround time for critical diagnostic tests.  Radiometers core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by more than 35% growth in AQT sales. High growth market sales were up more than 20% as we continued to expand our market position in China.  Leica Biosystems core sales were up low-single digits, as mid-teens growth in high growth markets was offset by weakness in core histology instruments in Europe. Advanced staining instrument placements were particularly strong as revenues increased over 20% in the quarter. We expect our advance staining growth rates to remain healthy, as our growing installed base continues to drive sales of reagents and other consumables. Core revenues in our life science platform grew at a low-single digit rate, compared to high-single digit growth in the third quarter of last year. Sales in the US and Western Europe were positive, but we continue to experience uncertainty in tender timings and funding in China.  AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits with strength in academic, clinical and applied markets. We continue to expand our in vitro diagnostic offerings by launching the Triple Quad 4500MD and QTRAP 4500 systems. 4500 series offers greater flexibility, exception sensitivity and faster data acquisition affording doctors and patients quicker access to reliable and accurate diagnostic test results.  Leica Microsystems core sales increased low-single digits. Our SP8 microscope continues to be very well received and drove double-digit growth for our Confocal microscope systems.  Last Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists including Leica long time collaborator and key opinion leader Professor Stefan Hell. Professor Hell and others were recognized for their work in developing a way to use optical microscopy to study the molecular processes in the living cells.  This work is especially meaningful to Leica, as we collaborated with Professor Hell to commercialize the first microscope that uses this technology back in 2004. Remarkably, this is the fourth year in a row that Leica Microscopes have been sighted in Nobel Prize wining work, and we are honored that our products continue to be used to support this and in other important scientific research. Turning to Dental, segment revenues increased 3.5%, while core revenues were up 2%. Our core operating margin increased 100 basis points and reported operating margin increased 110 basis points to 17.2%. The team has done a terrific job in using DBS to drive productivity and improve segment margins over the past several years. In early September, we announced the pending acquisition of Nobel Biocare, premier global brand and a pioneer in dental innovation.  Nobel Biocare has expertise in implant dentistry; digital prosthetics and software combined with our extensive capabilities in 3-D imaging, intra-oral scanning and digital restorative solutions will benefit both patients and dentists by further optimizing clinical workflows. We believe DBS will make a significant impact on Nobel Biocare\u2019s performance by helping to drive further innovation, growth and collaboration with our other dental companies. We are confident that Nobel Biocare is an outstanding bid for Danaher and we look forward to working with this capable team.  The purchase price of $2.2 billion equates to approximately three times revenues and less than four times gross profit, which we believe positions us well from a return perspective. The acquisition remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014 or the first quarter of 2015. Dental consumables core revenues grew low-single digits as healthy demand in China and the Middle East was partially offset by a modest decline in the developed markets. In the US, the sluggishness we saw in the second quarter continues. Encouragingly, demand for our implant products remain robust increasing globally at a double-digit rate. Dental technologies core revenues were up mid-single digits, driven by demand for our dental hand pieces and imaging equipment globally. In mid-September, we introduced the newest member of our family of Cone Beam 3-D imaging products, the i-CAT FLX MV for a medium field of view. The FLX MV allows dentist to capture a high resolution, lower radiation 3D image of the upper and lower piece. Our Tx STUDIO 5.3 software is also integrated in to the FLX allowing dentist to both scan patients mouth and prepare a full digital treatment plan from one location on a touch screen.  In our Industrial Technology segment, revenues increased 2% while the core revenues were up 4.5%, core operating margin expanded 145 basis points and reported operating margin increased a 170 basis points to 24.3%. Motion core revenues increased a low-single digit rate, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth to the platform.  Demand in the high growth markets was particularly strong, led by industrial automation in China. During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our electric vehicle systems and hybrid product lines which had annual revenue of approximately $100 million. Core revenues in our product identification platform grew mid-single digit as Europe and the Middle East both thus saw double-digit growth. At Videojet core revenues grew mid-single digits, as a growing installed base of equipment and solid execution in service help drive high single digit after market revenue growth.  During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1000 series of continuous inkjet printers. These printers featuring extended life printing core that reduces down time and enables customers to print almost continuously for five years.  Esko also experienced robust demand in the quarter, with double-digit growth in our workflow automation software and digital imaging products. In September, Esko released its new packaging design and workflow automation software Suite 14.  This comprehensive set of software tools helps brand owners interact with their global supply chains in the cloud in proving efficiency and control at every stage of the packaging, design and pre-production process. The reception of Suite 14 has been exceptional and over 1,000 customers have already upgraded since launch.  So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well this quarter, using the Danaher business system to expand margins, generate strong cash flow performance, and deliver higher than expected earnings. Across the portfolio our outstanding presence in high growth market, investments in innovative new products and focus on improving sales and marketing have helped our businesses continue to take share in their markets. As we plan for 2015, we remain mindful of the challenging macroeconomic outlook, including the recently strong dollar. Thus, we are continuing to invest in high-impact areas while also increasing spending on productivity initiatives to approximately $125 million in the second half of 2014.  We believe our focus on growth investments and margin expansion combined with our robust balance sheet and M&A capacity position us to finish 2014 well, and drive long term results.  We are initiating fourth quarter diluted net EPS guidance of $1-$1.04, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth similar to the first three quarters of 2014. so before we go to Q&A, I wanted to take a moment to share a few thoughts after the first six weeks of my time as Danaher\u2019s CEO. When this transition began, I knew that Danaher\u2019s future was bright. I believe it\u2019s now firmer than ever. The caliber of our team, the depth of incredible talent, that deep commitment to DBS and our culture is second to none. Financially, our balance sheet has never been stronger, much as we have done in the past, and more recently with the $3.3 billion, we have committed so far this year, I look forward to channeling this strength to build upon our leading portfolio of companies. At Danaher, we compete for shareholders and that is on the top of my mind everyday. We continue to look for smart ways to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders such as this week\u2019s announcement regarding the combination of our communications business with NetScout, the recent divestiture of our electric vehicle and hybrid motor product lines, and our pending acquisition of Nobel Biocare. As you know, we\u2019re always in the process of evaluating portfolio and our focus will be on acquiring smartly, partnering smartly and managing smartly. Lastly, our teams culture of continuous improvement using Danaher Business System will remain our primary focus, because that is who we are and that is what truly defines our competitive advantage. Matt Gugino : Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal remarks, and we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question today from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis - Barclays: Speaking of that, the equity market are telling us that there is bad stuff out there, but you guys don\u2019t seem to sense any panic amongst your customers or anything. Can you tell us if anything has changed in October, any activity amongst your customers, particularly in your more cyclical businesses like Industrial Tech or Fluke that folks are starting to hunker down a bit. Tom Joyce : Scott it\u2019s obviously still pretty early here in October, and I\u2019m sure they are all watching their screens or reading the paper day to day, but I think the simple answer to your question is, no. We\u2019ve seen a start to the October here is pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen through the last couple of quarters, but that is certainly not to suggest that this environment unfolds day to day here.  Those screens and those headlines won\u2019t start to influence people\u2019s behavior. Obviously over time we\u2019ve seen that happen, and frankly not that the last week has necessarily been the overwriting influence on us, but concerns over the macroeconomic situation, obviously the changes in currency, the shift and the strengthening of the dollar have all influenced the way we want to position ourselves going in to 2015.  But again going back to the short answer to your question, no, we are not seeing customer panic in the order book at the moment. Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay, and then the natural follow-on to that is the sellers, you know a bid ad spreads have been a little frustrating I think for most guys in industrial the last couple of years and the sellers have gotten a little, I don\u2019t want to call it greedy, but its certainly opportunistic. Have you seen your phone light up in the last couple of weeks where sellers might be a little bit more amenable to compromise. Tom Joyce : Again, I don\u2019t know that there has necessarily been any particular inflexion in the last couple of weeks or phone lines lighting up. But I would say that as the general direction we have seen some increased activity. We have seen I think the sellers interested in taking advantage of what are still some pretty rich valuations. But those same sellers are interested in the transaction. So I think we would generalize by saying that we are pleased with how the funnels are sitting today, the cultivation conversations are good and we seem to be making progress in some those conversations. So, directionally we feel pretty good about where we are. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Just wanted to pick up on the comments about what might be changing, and you are obviously planning for a pretty similar growth environment to what we\u2019ve seen both in 3Q and year-to-date. But I am wondering if the mix of that 3% is somewhat different and obviously Europe, there is focus attention here and are you projecting a weaker Europe, maybe stronger US; any change in the mix of that 3%? Tom Joyce : I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we are thinking about any dramatic shifts in that mix, but I would say there are probably a few things to note. I would say we\u2019ve seen and perhaps we\u2019d expect to see some marginal improvement here in the US. I would say while the European environment has been stable quarter-to-quarter, obviously there is a bit of concern out there right now about Germany and some potential slowing there. So as Germany goes as we know, sometimes Europe goes and so I think there is a reason for some caution as it relates to Europe. More recently we have seen softness in Latin America specifically in Brazil, and of course the situation in Russia has changed the trajectory of that market. So I think when you put all of that together, and then you add some continued very good growth in China maybe not quite as high as over a long period of time, but certainly some continued very big growth. I think you see some shifts on the margin, but we\u2019d still consider the high growth market to be the leaders, the developed markets sort of hanging in there. But maybe within each of those two major \u2013 that split, you might see some shifts here and there. Dan Comas : Nigel maybe just to add one thing on Europe. As Tom and I went through the strategic reviews here, over the summer and the fall, we actually think on a relative basis Europe\u2019s one of the places we are doing pretty well, and some businesses where we felt we were taking share, a chunk of that was in Europe. Hard not to be worried about all the headlines here in Europe, news about Greece today and their sudden rise again in interest rates, borrowing rates over there. But actually at a relative basis I feel we like we performed pretty well there. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay, so [Inaudible] some mug shakings there, that\u2019s pretty clear. And then just digging a little bit deeper, one of the hospital providers called out some benefits from the Affordable Care Act on their patient volumes, and I am wondering if you\u2019ve seen some benefits from that on your consumables, and then on top of that life sciences remains a great challenge in China and I am wondering if you have a line of sight of when that might start improving. Tom Joyce : So on the Affordable Care Act and the impact on consumables, first of all we are very encouraged by the progress that we are making at that, and I would say largely the progress we are making there and frankly across the entire diagnostic portfolio is very good execution across those businesses and those businesses I think are particularly Radiometer taking share and Leica Biosystems doing very well particularly in advanced staining which is an important area of future growth in one of the better market segments.  We think utilization is probably marginally improved as a function of the Affordable Care Act, and I think there are some out there who would certainly say that the states with Medicaid expansion are the ones where we are seeing that uptake. We are also seeing improvements in the hospital\u2019s balance sheets, with a little bit of pressure taken off the bad debt side. So you kind of put those things together and yeah there\u2019s a marginally improving environment there, but relative to any improvement beyond that right now, I think its probably still a little early to tell, but improvements on the margin.  In terms of life science and in China specifically that\u2019s probably one of the most challenging environment out there today. You\u2019ve heard us talk and perhaps others talk about some of the delays in funding in the life sciences market, some of the concerns around compliance in that market that may be underpinning some of those delays, as China enforces what we believe are ultimately good policies for how that market will operate.  But nevertheless, that is a market that continues to be a slow market today, and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a phenomenon that\u2019s going to ease up here in the next couple of weeks, let alone perhaps even in the next couple of months. So I think we are sort of thinking that that could be something that continues to be under some pressure, a slower growth market, maybe into 2015. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein Research. Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research : Tom may be a little perspective on Tektronix specifically; you know this is the first quarter in 11 quarters almost three years I suppose that where it\u2019s turned positive even if you said it was up low-single digit but slightly. Is this the start of something a little more significant, and what drove that turn, you know is there something fundamental that that\u2019s starting to shift a little bit in that business that you\u2019re seeing. Tom Joyce : It\u2019s obviously been a challenging time over a number of quarters, but we are very encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters and the change there. I think that team has executed very well. I think they have done some very good things from a product and from a go-to-market standpoint.  Seeing two data points together is always a good thing to do on the positive side, but I think that\u2019s still a business that will be probably a low-single digit grower here over the near term.  So I would attribute it a little bit more on the execution side that necessarily a fundamental shift to an inflexion point in the market. I mean clearly there are some things going on that will drive market growth over time, but I put a little bit more on the teams execution here more recently. Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research : And you mentioned Ballast Water for Trojan, that\u2019s another encouraging sign. Is this just a one-off you think or something more significant again? Tom Joyce : No, we would not consider this to be just a one-off. We would consider it to be just the beginning and early and very positive indication of the market acceptance, and I think its just important to remember that these regulatory approvals are really kind of threshold events for starting to bring this market to an inflexion point of higher growth, and so we are excited by the approval that we got, the AMS approval that I mentioned.  But that\u2019s not as big a deal quite frankly as getting formal US Type approval that I mentioned that we expect next year. So more to come on that, very encouraging early indication of acceptance and it\u2019s I think an indication of good things to come. Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research : And if I could just sneak one more in on the separation all through this week, the value of the business combination you\u2019ve made abundantly clear. Just may be a little more thinking on the shareholder value of doing this outside of Danaher rather than within Danaher. Dan Comas : Steve its Dan, I think it\u2019s a reflection of our long held view, NetScout\u2019s long held view that there was a lot of increment \u2013 and this is a one plus one equals three. It\u2019s a little bit like our tools joint venture, but we think with a greater growth profile, and we just ultimately concluded this was the best way to affect that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: So you mentioned Ballast water and I guess are there any other businesses may be Beckman perhaps that just from some company specific dynamics should perhaps look better at this time next year versus what they are doing now, just outside of the macro. Tom Joyce : Steve I saw several opportunities that businesses had as I came through the strategic reviews that would point towards growth potential in a number of businesses. I think for example, if you think about Gilbarco Veeder-Root, and what we are seeing around the early indications around the customer baser moving towards compliance with the EMV regulations that I mentioned.  I think that\u2019s an indicator of some momentum that we could see later in 2015. I think and you mentioned Beckman Diagnostics specifically. I think that Beckman continues to drive their improvements in quality, in service, in delivery and the overall customer experience, and then you combine that with some of the new product clearances and then the introduction of our molecular diagnostics platform [Barrettes] next year. I think that too has exciting potential for Beckman.  So I think because it would be too outside and there would be a number of others if we walked across the portfolio. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Right, and from a macro perspective it sounds like this is 3% type of economy. It doesn\u2019t sound like you think even though you highlight the macro challenge that\u2019s out there, it doesn\u2019t sound like you think this is kind of a 1% -2% economy, this is just kind of a stable and steady growth type of environment we are in right now. Tom Joyce : Yeah, I don\u2019t think we want to go Chicken Little on here, but I think we want to be ready for what comes. We\u2019ve done that obviously over a long period of time when the cycles moved through, we try to anticipate where challenges come and we think there\u2019s some indications out there that would be challenges, but we are not trying to call a crisis here. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Yeah, and then one last question just on portfolio mix, by buying Nobel and doing this deal for the comps business I would assume this kind of reinforces the view that you guys aren\u2019t particularly stuck in a frame of mind that was a certain percentage from a healthcare and a certain percentage from industrial businesses. You are going to go where the opportunities provide the best strategic and financial returns. Tom Joyce : Steve I probably couldn\u2019t say it any better than you just said it. We are not stuck on percentages and we absolutely moved to where we can add the greatest value for our shareholders by making those portfolio moves that come our way and that we can make happen over time. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Is it too late for sellers to get something done by the end of this year or is everybody just kind of looking more towards \u201915. How robust is the pipeline? Dan Comas : Steve it\u2019s not a tax driver here that \u2013 but on the margin here the last two or three months and just what we\u2019ve seen in the last four-five months has been encouraging regarding conversations. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners : Just a quick one or two; just on the sell side of things Tom, the NetScout deal is interesting right in an environment where its tough to buy perhaps it makes sense to sell a few things. So I just wonder, we are all fairly acquainted with your portfolio, but what\u2019s the prospect for other moves perhaps structured in different ways but kind of pruning opportunities in the portfolio. Tom Joyce : First of all it\u2019s important to recognize that there was not motivation behind the partnership with NetScout that had to do with it being tough to buy. We thought that was just a great opportunity not matter what as you might have expected. But we will continue to evaluate the portfolio and make sure that that our businesses are well positioned for the future.  I think we have a tremendous portfolio today. I think going across the strategic plans that I did and not that I saw every operating company during the season but I saw all the major operating companies and certainly all of them from a platform point of view.  And I think there\u2019s just a lot of potential that we have across the entire portfolio today. But that being said, you\u2019ve heard Larry say it over a long period of time that no business has a permanent home at Danaher, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate whether each of our businesses is well positioned in the portfolio and if we see opportunities for smart partnering or an opportunity where that business is better served to be in a better place, we\u2019ll certainly look to make that happen.  But in general I am thrilled with the portfolio we have today. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners : Right, and then I was just wondering if we could get a little additional color on just what\u2019s going on restructuring, just kind of a couple of questions and points around that. Tom I think you said a 125 million in second half implying some of it started in Q3. I am wondering Dan if you can just kind of give us a little color kind of Q3 versus Q4 and if there is any change in deal cost and other things that are going on in the fourth quarter and may be just a little thought if you could on where the activity is taking place and what the payback might be. Dan Comas : Jeff on the about where it\u2019s taking place, obviously a lot of communication to do here, so we are going to avoid to get in to specifics. But the 125 million largely, and that over 90% of this will be in the fourth quarter. Broad based, we would expect about a little bit less than a one year pay back. So on an annualized basis, we expect about a 100 million of savings and roughly $0.10 a share. Probably don\u2019t get all of that until we get to the end of the first quarter, given there\u2019s often some kind of lag effect, but found a lot of good projects here and obviously we made decision to execute upon them. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners : Any change in deal cost in it. Tom Joyce : Jeff I just might add to that, I think if Dan and I went through each of the individual businesses both during the operating reviews earlier or during the strategic plan reviews, it was clear that the businesses were already thinking ahead as to where those opportunities might be and how to take advantage of it.  So we were really pleased with how the businesses looked broadly across the portfolio and came up with really a terrific group of projects. Dan Comas : And then Jeff just in terms of deal costs we highlighted some of that in July. I don\u2019t think its changed much clearly loosing the motion business and the earnings in the fourth quarter that\u2019s obviously in the guide here, we continue to work on the integration of the Siemens business that\u2019s going well, but we are spending money on that.  The only thing that could be of significance that we would call it out, if we were to Nobel here in the fourth quarter which was a possibility, we would have some one-time expense which given the magnitude we would call out separately. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Just a question on Dental firstly, sort of earlier in the quarter you talked about US sell-through of consumables being a little bit better, doesn\u2019t seem to have shown up yet in your number. Is that something you think reverses pretty soon, and also dental very, very strong core margin improvement performance in Q3 that after a pretty weak Q2. What do you think is a kind of steady-state run rate on that dental margin trajectory should be? Tom Joyce : On the dental consumables Julian, it clearly is a business that is still closely tied to what we think is a fairly slow growth macro environment, and so I think we are doing a good job from an execution standpoint I think, but clearly we don\u2019t have any tailwind from a market standpoint.  So, we\u2019ve got work to do there, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything impressive, any more noteworthy than the environment in which that business is performing today. Dan will comment on the second on kind of an outlook on margins, but you are right to note certainly that it\u2019s a good performance from dental on the margin side in Q3. Dental technologies in particular did a very good job on driving margins, some of that a function of things we did last year around productivity, some of that just continuing good work this year from an execution standpoint, and then a little bit of help overall across the segment from a mix standpoint with consumables despite the slightly slower growth that you commented on, generally providing a pretty good mix for the segment overall. Dan Comas : And Julian in terms of margin, for the full year, and there will be some noise in Q4 obviously because of restructuring but from a core basis, we would expect core margin expansion in that 75-100 basis points core margin improvement during the year. You obviously saw more than that here in the third quarter. It\u2019s a little bit hard for me to kind of quote a number here given the expectation of Nobel coming in, because we will have a lot of noise for a couple of quarters. But ultimately with Nobel what we have we think this is a 20% segment in four to five year from now. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : And then just on the outlook, you obviously talked about restructuring measures you are enacting now, and you talked earlier about the decent increases in SG&A and R&D in Q3 funded by the gross margins. Have your own spending plans whether OPEX or CapEx changed in light of the macro conditions that you sight or for now you are kind of proceeding as you were and you will just watch to be able to put closely for changes. Tom Joyce : Julian probably important to note here that we are just now entering in to budget season here, so we\u2019ll have work to do with each of the individual operating companies to understand how they are positioning for 2015.  And one of the things we try to make sure we do through that process is to recognize that there\u2019s not a one size fits all across the portfolio when it comes to investment, where those gross margin improvements either come from and/or where they get reinvested. So as we walk across the businesses we will be thoughtful as we\u2019ve always been about making sure that we are investing smartly in to those businesses that have the best opportunities, that they are at the best positions in their market and that\u2019s where you see [less] for example in R&D and in sales and marketing and perhaps some other spots you might see us stay a little tighter. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Just a couple of quick questions, on Siemens is that transaction that\u2019s tracking on the timeline is that a first quarter close and Dan could you just give the IT integration expenses in Q3 and Q4 are those still kind of summing to may be 10 million but between the quarters. Dan Comas : That\u2019s directionally correct; I don\u2019t have them to break down. We just debrief with the Beckman team the other day on the integration and its going well and all our expectations are for a Q1 close. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: And then also Tom just in terms of China we continue to put up some very nice double digit growth there as mentioned, and I think we understand the issues in the life sciences market place there and being regulatory and hopefully they clear sooner rather than later.  But it feels a little bit contradictory, your growth in China coming in some of these more cyclical markets, T&M, I think motion was mentioned. It seems contrary may be to the macro perspective that people have in China.  So do you attribute your double-digit growth to your initiatives distribution, sales, marketing or how do you reconcile that. Tom Joyce : Sure Rich thanks for the question. Jim Lico and I were together in China, I think its now two or three weeks ago for a number of days, and we\u2019ve sat with each one of our individual businesses, in many case I was sitting with businesses that I was less familiar with.  But clearly I think what we saw was, we saw a very good group of people , an outstanding set of teams that are continuing to build commercial reach in those markets. We are seeing teams now putting innovation related resources on the ground, product planning resources we are adding to our local R&D presence, developing product for that local market and commercializing those product in ways that I think are helping to drive our growth.  And you are right to observe that, that growth is coming fairly broadly across not just for example places where we\u2019ve talked about it in the past like Beckman Diagnostics that continues to do an excellent job. Of course that\u2019s a very big business over there, so that\u2019s obviously part of that growth, but it is broad based.  The dental team for example, an outstanding over there that\u2019s continuing to drive double digit growth and that\u2019s not only good market but the team executing very well. So I think if you put that altogether and it\u2019s a good portfolio, well positioned in a number of good markets with good teams that are continuing to invest aggressively. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Just one follow-up question on the life science business; if I look at your comments here you did say a combination of pressure in China both in terms of the overall demand environment as well as budget delays. So I was wondering which of the two was may be a bigger factor just to give us an insight on what your visibility is on our recovery there heading in to next year. Tom Joyce : Isaac tough to parse what you described as budget delays versus overall demand. But if I were to try and generalize, we know that there has been and continues to be scrutiny over, particularly the larger tenders, the instrumentation related tenders, and whether you call that budgetary or you call it a demand, I am not sure.  Now that being said there is another dimension which is, we are on a macro basis, our investments going at the moment, and clearly we see investments going in to the diagnostics that\u2019s more in the healthcare side of the house, and we are seeing obviously the benefit of that and our business is doing very well there. And perhaps that means slightly less in to the true research side of the house, but I think it\u2019s a little tough to parse that much more precisely. Dan Comas :  I think I would say compared to 90 days ago, initially goes to kind of Rich\u2019s previous question, there are some parts in China that we actually incrementally feel a little better about. But I think to be fair on life science we\u2019d have to say we are incrementally a little bit more negative than we were 90 days ago. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : That\u2019s helpful. And then on T&M you guys have been (inaudible) tell a little bit expectations for a continued negative growth there in the wireless business in to 2015 so. So just wondering how broad based that is across to customers and just confirming that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue of market share just more of the environment. Dan Comas : We think it\u2019s largely an environment and I think that the thing that\u2019s kind of most encouraging here is we saw orders turn positive in the third quarter for the platform, and that trend actually looks pretty good heading here in to Q4 as well. The issue there is, we often get - some of that orders we actually get upfront payment, you see that in some of the numbers in our cash flow statement, but we actually won\u2019t book revenues for six, nine and 12 months out.  So we are seeing a nice turn in terms of orders. The next couple of quarters are going to be challenged here, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed, but I think the outlook\u2019s looking a little better here. Operator : Ladies and Gentlemen that does conclude our question and answer session. Mr. Gugino, I will turn it back to you for closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks everyone for joining us, we\u2019ll be around all day for questions. Operator : Ladies and Gentlemen thank you so much for your participation this morning.

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher Business System continue to enhance our competitive advantage driving market share gains, solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow generation. For the full year our targeted organic investments help drive 3.5% core revenue growth and our total revenue is now just shy of $20 billion. These investments in new products and go-to-market initiatives enabled us to increase market share in many of our businesses, including Fluke, Hach, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct and Videojet. From a portfolio optimization perspective, 2014 was also a very busy year for Danaher. We announced or closed 18 acquisitions for nearly $4 billion, improving our market-leading positions across the portfolio. Most notable among these are our two large deals, Nobel Biocare and Devicor, which closed in December. We also announced the combination of our Communications business with NetScout, which we believe will better position these two highly complimentary businesses for long-term success. Finally, we divested the electric vehicle systems and hybrid product lines within our automation platform. Going forward, we remain focused on building a better, stronger Danaher by utilizing our robust balance sheet and smartly deploying our $8 billion plus of acquisition capacity. In 2014 we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 122%. This represents the 23rd consecutive year in which our free cash flow exceeded net income, an important metric that represent the quality of the earnings we generate. We also returned more of this cash to shareholders, increasing our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share. Turning to the fourth quarter, revenues grew 3% to $5.4 billion, while organic revenue grew 4%, exceeding our expectations. More than half of our platforms delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth, including T&M Instruments, Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences and Product ID. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%, while currency translation decreased revenues by 3.5%. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets increased at a mid single-digit rate. Performance was mixed with solid results in China and double-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by slowing growth in Latin America and a high teens decline in Russia. In the developed markets, both the U.S. and Western Europe, grew at a mid single-digit rate, an acceleration from the low single-digit growth experienced in the first three quarters of the year. Sales in the U.S. increased at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2011, with our Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Life Sciences platforms up more than 10%. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 52.5%, excluding the impact of productivity initiatives. Core operating margin increased 70 basis points, with three of our five segments improving greater than a 100 basis points. Our reported operating margin declined 50 basis points to 16.4%, due primarily to increased productivity charges and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. In total, we spent approximately $155 million on productivity initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, our gross margin was 52.4% and our gross profit improved nearly $500 million. This allowed us to increase our combined investment in R&D, in sales and marketing over $200 million from 2013, while expanding core operating margin 65 basis points. We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $1.04, which compares favorably to our previous guidance of a $1 to a $1.04, and represents an increase of 8% year-on-year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.68, also up 8% from 2013. Now turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues increased 1.5%, while core revenues were up 0.5%. Reported operating margin improved 130 basis points, while core operating margin declined slightly. Core revenue in our instruments platform increased at a mid-single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies. This was the platform\u2019s highest quarterly growth rate in over three years, driven by improving market conditions, organic investments and new product innovations such as Fluke Connect. Fluke core revenues were up mid-single-digits for the second consecutive quarter, with our core industrial and biomedical product lines, each increasing at a high single-digit rate or better. Distribution sellout in North America accelerated sequentially, growing at a high single-digit rate. Demand in Europe was also healthy. At Tektronix, core sales were up mid-single digits, representing the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2011. Demand was strongest in North America with solid growth in the military and government, optical and semiconductor segments. During the quarter, Tektronix launched the RSA306 radio frequency spectrum analyzer, a portable USB powered device, which offers as much functionality as a bench-top equipment, allowing engineers in the field to ensure radio frequencies of free of distortion and interference. Our communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. Mid-single-digit growth in our security solution and network enterprises businesses was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions where we continued to experience delays from our North American wireless carrier customers. Despite the weakness on the topline, we were encouraged by our book-to-bill ratio, which was almost 1.2 times for the second half of 2014. And we believe our communications platform will return to growth in 2015. We continue to expect a combination of our communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either our communications business or NetScout. At Arbor, North American sales increased over 25%, with robust demand from enterprise security customers. During the quarter, Arbor further strengthened its presence in the enterprise segment with the launch of Pravail Security Analytics. This scalable cloud-based solution allows organizations of any size to detect and view attacks on their global network in real time and in greater detail than ever before. Fluke Networks saw double-digit growth in its network installation tools and enterprise systems products. FNET bookings also grew at a double-digit rate, surpassing $100 million in the quarter for the first time in its history. Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues grew 5.5% with core revenues up 5%. Segment operating margin declined 330 basis points, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions and incremental productivity charges. Water quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by robust growth in our analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment businesses. Hach had another outstanding quarter, with growth across most major product lines. U.S. municipal sales were up high single digits, as customers are increasing their maintenance project budgets. Sales in China were up over 20%, driven by the government\u2019s continued focus on environmental protection. And last quarter, we highlighted the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, a breakthrough product that simplifies the water quality testing process. Hach\u2019s new product introductions, including the SL1000 have exceeded expectations, with revenue from new portable lab products tripling from 2013. ChemTreat reached another sales milestone in December, achieving 400 million in annual sales for the first time. ChemTreat has now nearly doubled in size from its acquisition in 2007. Notably, this has largely been organic, the result of the development and application of their best-in-class go-to market model. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single digits, as sales of point of sale solutions and dispensers in the U.S. increased over 30%. GVR's comprehensive product suite has helped to make a deferred solution among customers, looking to upgrade their payment systems to comply with upcoming EMV security requirements. Sales were also robust in China, where demand for GVR\u2019s vapor recovery and dispenser products grew double digits. Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, revenue increased 3% with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin improved 135 basis points. For the full year, core operating margin expanded 110 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive year, segment core operating margin has improved over a 100 basis points. Core revenues in our diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits, with healthy demand in both the high-growth and developed markets. For the third consecutive quarter, core revenues at Beckman Coulter increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by immunoassay, chemistry and urinalysis solutions. Beckman also experienced strength in their automation business where new product such as Power Express drove record December shipments. The positive momentum in the U.S. continued, with our sales team achieving record customer retention and win rates, leading to mid-single-digit growth. Beckman received 510(k) clearance for the Vitamin D Total assay on its access line of instruments. This represents a significant addition to Beckman\u2019s bone metabolism testing menu, as nearly 1 billion people in the world are estimated to be Vitamin D deficient. Beckman also introduced four immunosuppressant drug assays, allowing doctors to better monitor therapeutic drugs in transplant recipients. Radiometer\u2019s core revenues were up approximately 10%, with HemoCue sales increasing double-digits and AQT growing over 35%. 2014 marked Radiometer's 10th anniversary with Danaher. The results over the past decade have been extraordinary with the team increasing revenues more than 2.5 times to nearly $800 million, while tripling operating profit. Leica Biosystems core sales were up high-single digits, with healthy demand across our entire suite of anatomical pathology instrumentation and consumables. Advanced staining finished the year, particularly strong in the U.S., placing a record number of Bond systems in the quarter. In December, Leica Biosystems acquired Devicor, a leading provider of minimally-invasive biopsy systems and consumables used in breast cancer diagnostics. This acquisition moves Leica further upstream in anatomical pathology to the biopsy, providing better sample control and delivering higher levels of diagnostic quality and confidence. Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up mid-single digits, led again by the U.S. and Europe. AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits with strength in clinical, pharma and applied markets. We've been pleased with the market reception of our new 6600 TripleTOF SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software with demand exceeding expectations since launch in June of last year. Those of you who attended our Investor Day last month heard about OneOmics AB SCIEX\u2019s innovative partnership with Illumina. OneOmics brings together next-generation sequencing and proteomics data in the cloud to help advance research across multiple diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart disease. This unique solution has received significant attention in the research community and was named one of the top 15 inventions in 2014 by the Analytical Scientist magazine. Leica Microsystems core sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all major product lines. The confocal line of microscopes continues to garner industry recognition with the latest SP8 STED 3X receiving a Top 10 Innovation award from The Scientist Magazine. The STED further advanced its research in important fields such as immunology by providing scientist a 3D view of previously unobservable details of living cells. Turning to Dental; segment revenues increased 6%, while core revenues were up 2.5%. Our core operating margin improved 185 basis points. As we previously mentioned, during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Nobel Biocare. We are excited to have Nobel Biocare as part of the Danaher team and the business end 2014 with its seventh consecutive quarter of core revenue growth. While still very early, we've been pleased with the feedback from both associates and customers and we look forward to sharing further updates on Nobel\u2019s performance with you in the coming months. Dental consumables core revenues were up low-single digits with 30% growth in China and the Middle East, partially offset by continued weakness in the U.S. Implant Direct, our value-oriented implant business continues to perform well growing double digits. During the quarter we expanded our endodontic product line with the launch of ElementsFree, a cordless hand tool featuring motorized extrusion and precise temperature control, giving endodontist unmatched accuracy and flexibility to perform complex procedures, such as root canals. Dental technologies core revenues were up low-single digits, led by double-digit growth in hand pieces. Last quarter we launched the i-CAT FLX MV, our most recent advanced in 3D imaging. Customer reception has been exceptional with over 100 systems shipped to-date. We also expanded our line of dental surgical equipment with the launch of KaVo MASTERsurg LUX. The KaVo MASTERsurg line is our latest innovation in surgical instruments for dental implants and oral surgery improving productivity and clinical accuracy by enabling dentists to store and program settings for multiple procedures. The MASTERsurg line also provides better surgical command and flexibility with the industry's first wireless foot control. Moving to our Industrial Technology segment; revenues declined 1%, while core revenues were up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 120 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 20.4%. Automation core revenues grew at a low-single digit rate, led by strong demand in North American distribution and for industrial automation products in China. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for the automation platform. Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits, with high-single digit growth in developed markets and double-digit growth in Europe. At Videojet, core revenue was up high-single digits as it continues to gain market share broadly. During the quarter, Videojet launched remote services, the industry's first virtual troubleshooting solution for printers. With remote services, maintenance technicians can now resolve customer problems up to 90% faster than field visits. Innovative solutions such as these help Videojet increase their service contracts more than 20% in 2014. X-Rite finished the year strong with both sales and orders growing double digits. In December, Pantone announced Marsala as the 2015 Color of the Year with extensive media coverage online, in-print and on TV. The Color of the Year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high-single-digit growth in X-Rite\u2019s color standards business in 2014. So to wrap up, we had a strong finish to the year with core revenue growth exceeding our expectations. The Danaher business system helped us to gain market share, while also driving solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow. While cognizant of the current macroeconomic challenges, our investments in growth and productivity initiatives, combined with a robust balance sheet, we\u2019re confident in our ability to outperform in 2015 and beyond. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.90 to $0.94, which excludes non-cash amortization expense and certain acquisition-related charges. We are assuming first quarter core revenue growth of 4% or better. We\u2019re also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our December investor meeting is expected to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. We anticipate offsetting approximately $0.05 per share of this headwind from savings associated with the incremental fourth quarter productivity initiatives we highlighted, recent acquisitions, including the Siemens microbiology deal which we expect to close in the near-term, as well as other actions. Core revenue for the full year 2015 is anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Aaron, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will first go to Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning guys. Tom Joyce : Good morning Steve. Steven Winoker : Hope you\u2019re staying warm and dried down there. Tom Joyce : And same to you and to all on the call. Thanks for what might have been a challenging morning for many. Steven Winoker : I\u2019m sure none of us have missed this, anyway. Core operating margin in T&M and Environmental, could you just walk us through the slight decline in T&M and a bigger one in Environmental. What drove that? Little more detail there would be great. Dan Comas : Sure Steve. The Test & Measurement in -- obviously the decline this quarter is lot less than it has been in previous quarter and it is largely driven by the communications business, which was again down mid-teen. So a very high contribution margin business and that volume usually impacting Test & Measurement. Steven Winoker : And then Environmental? Dan Comas : Environmental, it was pretty clear we were having a very strong quarter both in GVR and across the water businesses. They have a number of growth initiatives and this created an opportunity to accelerate some of that R&D and go-to-market investment here in the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s indicative of a trend in all. I think it was an opportunity to get ahead of some things given the strength we saw that began early in the fourth quarter. Tom Joyce : And Steve, just to add to that, on the Environmental side, certainly talking to water analytics businesses, those businesses continue to perform exceptionally well. They have covered virtually every debt they've made when it came to some incremental investment to drive topline and share gains. So when those guys come up with an opportunity to put a little bit more at work to drive growth in share, we tend to be supportive of that if we can see our way to cover and form. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. And then on currency, maybe you know -- I know we\u2019ve talked about currency a lot in the past. You weren\u2019t able to fully offset that for your guide for the year, just given how bigger drop obviously it\u2019s been even since December. But are we -- should we -- what\u2019s your ability, I think to sort of provide, you think, maybe additional offset during the year? And then secondly, just -- do you have any competitive issues on pricing what not in any of your markets as given there is such a large move in currency and competitor\u2019s ability to price for that? Tom Joyce : Steve, on the first point, we have -- in no way, we thrown in the towel on the balance of going after that extra $0.05. We\u2019re continuing to challenge the teams as we always do to try to come back on that. But we\u2019re encouraged by the strong start we've had here coming off of the fourth quarter, encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in the early stages here of January, so that feels good. But we know the strength of the dollar is a headwind. We\u2019re doing things proactively as we did using the productivity initiatives to get a piece of that back. Siemens is obviously going to help a bit there. And I think we\u2019d also get a little bit of help and that\u2019s part of the $0.05 that we\u2019ve clawed back from what we think would be a maybe a little bit of deflation that could help us on some commodity costs and perhaps some freight and transport top cost. So I think we\u2019ve got a few things that give us confidence in getting the first $0.05 back but we\u2019re continuing to work on the balance per share. Tom Joyce : I think on the second question about competitively, clearly there has been an impact with the euro on our financial results but competitively we have not seen that impact. We said after the third quarter, we thought we were taking share in Europe. We just posted a mid-single-digit core growth number in Europe. I suspect that\u2019s going to be towards the top of the class here as all companies would report. So despite the stronger dollar, we are performing extremely well in Europe right now. Steven Winoker : All right, guys. I\u2019ll now pass it on. Thanks. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Good morning guys. Tom Joyce : Hey, Shannon. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Hey, just in terms of the strength that you saw in the U.S., maybe a little more color on what particular piece of that might have surprised you most and what you feel the best about continuing? Tom Joyce : Sure. Well, as I think I mentioned, it was a terrific quarter in the U.S. best since the second quarter of 2011. It was remarkably broad based, Shannon. We saw strength at GVR, saw strength in T&M instruments, the tech and fluid continuing to execute better, saw good sellout associated with the fluid business. The Hach business continues to perform very well with our muni customers, releasing funds associated with projects. And we\u2019re very encouraged by what we saw in Life Sciences with good performance in that platform. So it was a number of businesses that that had a very good finish to the year in the U.S. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: And some times, we\u2019ve had a good fourth quarter and then you kind of catches up a little bit in 1Q. I mean, this was in sense any kind of boost from just kind of year end flush? Tom Joyce : Yeah. So it\u2019s -- one of my favorite topics, Shannon, in the first week of any January is that we see anything that might cause an air pocket. It looks pretty good from where we sit right now. The early January orders and it is still early, appear pretty good. So we\u2019re encouraged by that and we think we are off to a good start. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: And then just on M&A, the world has got more volatile here in the markets certainly in \u201815. Is that good for you guys from an M&A perspective? I mean, do you feel better about the acquisition environment than you did few months ago or worse? How does that impact you? Dan Comas : Well, Shannon, generally volatility is kind of a positive for the strong corporate buyer. We\u2019ve seen some of the restrictions being put on private equity here around leverage. That definitely has a favorable impact as well. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Tom Joyce : Thanks Shannon. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about what you're seeing in emerging markets and maybe within some of your more cyclical businesses in emerging markets, China maybe specifically? Tom Joyce : Sure, Steve. We\u2019re continuing to see very good performance in China. But first of all just broadly across high-growth markets, we clearly have seen a narrowing of the delta that we've seen for a long time between the high-growth markets and developed markets in general. Part of that is a function of some of the strength we've seen in the U.S., certainly our execution in Europe where we gained share in the variety of places. It continues to also support good performance on our side on the developed markets. On the high-growth market side, again helping it to causing a narrowing of that delta, we\u2019ve got a slower position in China in a macro sense. Obviously some weakness in smaller markets where we have less exposure but we see a little bit of impact in places like Russia and Brazil, clearly is in a slower growth mode than it has been in the prior couple of years. Probably, a bright spot in the Middle East with excellent performance from our businesses. But I see, actually we\u2019ve believe a pretty good macro environment there at least at the moment. In China specifically, Steve, we\u2019ve had very good performance across a number of our businesses, the Environmental business, certainly Hach and GVR performing exceptionally well there. Our dental business continues to grow double-digits in China and probably the core weak spots remains the Life Science business. We've talked quite a bit over the last number of months about some of the issues there relative to some scrutiny around tenders, some slowing of the release of funding. But we think there -- that we might think that -- there maybe a point of stability that we\u2019ve reached here and maybe some cause for some improvement here in 2015. Dan was actually just there a week or so ago in China and he may have a couple of thoughts. Dan Comas : Yes. Steve, just add one or two things. We grew full year in China kind of 8% or 9%. Q4 was a little slower as more like 6%, but I would say the tone there was pretty good. Clearly, Test & Measurement got better through the year, much better second half than first half. As Tom alluded to all the -- most of the healthcare businesses, Environmental -- Environmental was up double-digit, Dental was up double-digit, Diagnostic was up double-digit on a very large revenue base and Industrial which was negative had returned to kind of modest growth as well. Life Sciences was down mid single-digit for the full year kind of in that zone in the fourth quarter, but I think that the tone in early January. I think, in part, because 2015 will be the -- is the fifth year of their current five-year plan and they are fundamentally, I think, so very committed as a country to Life Sciences research, I think the tone is little better there as well. I am not saying, we\u2019re going to bounce back to double-digit growth here in Life Sciences, but would not be at all surprised if we turn positive here in \u201915. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks for the color. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Good morning, gents. Tom Joyce : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hi. Just a couple of quick one here too. Could you elaborate a little bit, Tom, on the comments on U.S. muni? Do you think there is actually a turn going on there or was there just kind of some project activity in the quarter? Tom Joyce : Jeff, I think, in general, we see some macro strength in the muni market, with some of the situations in a variety of municipalities getting marginally better and that\u2019s allowed some projects to get released. I wouldn't say that\u2019s the whole story though. The Hach business continues to execute exceptionally well, many of their digital marketing initiatives and their expansion of feet on the street, across both the muni market and the Industrial market, I think is help them to continue to gain share. So I think a combination of a marginally improving macro environment is part of the story and share gains being the other part. Jeff Sprague : Have you seen any change in kind of seller\u2019s attitude here with kind of all the turmoil in general and kind of the QE in Europe, just any change in tone or activity at this point? Tom Joyce : Jeff, its hart to point anything specific other than last competition from private equity, which is a positive. Jeff Sprague : Right. Right. And then could you just elaborate a little bit more on the acceleration you had in Europe? Was there something that stood out? Was it broad based across the businesses? Tom Joyce : We saw -- it was relatively broad based, Jeff. Life Sciences executed extremely well. We saw good growth there. Our Dental business, but particularly on the equipment side, the Dental business also executed very well and PID, those would be at least three that I would highlight. If I added a fourth, it would probably be the Beckman Diagnostics business also executing very well. So it was markedly broad, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think about that as something indicative of a change in the macro environment in Europe. We saw nothing that would perhaps really indicate that. But instead, we just -- we had some teams that, I think, did an excellent job of some new products and we\u2019re really driving their sales and marketing initiatives very effectively. Jeff Sprague : And that is in Europe for Europe right. There is not any kind of export kick out of there on lower euro, right? Tom Joyce : That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s revenue into Western Europe, right. Jeff Sprague : Perfect. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good morning. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Just a quick one on the Nobel deal, do the changes in the FX reality affect, how you view accretion there for the year and any chance you could give us the actual point estimate on the 4Q organic growth to that business? Dan Comas : Brandon, it won't have much of an impact. They do have some cost base over there as we -- we also have some cost related to some of our other Healthcare businesses. The offset is we all told. We have about $200 million of revenues in Switzerland, so that will be a benefit. So net-net, neither for Nobel nor the Corporation do we think what\u2019s happened with the Swiss currency. It\u2019s going -- it will be relatively neutral task. That business continues to kind of grow at kind of 2% to 4% clip and that\u2019s been over the last couple of quarters, they were in that zone for Q4 as well. Brandon Couillard : Excellent. Secondly, on the Dental business, I mean, a number of companies that wanted to strength in the U.S. in the back half of the year? I mean, to what degree at all if you seen any vitality in the developed world, particularly in the U.S. and is there any sign of optimism in terms of an acceleration perhaps this year? Tom Joyce : Brandon, I think, we\u2019re probably most excited about what we see on the equipment side in Dental. The new product innovation, I think, you saw many of those when we were out in California earlier during the year in 2014. The digital initiatives and I think, some of the potential that we have as we integrate the components of the workflow that Nobel Biocare can bring to the table along with what the KaVo, Kerr group of businesses bring. I think that\u2019s really where our optimism sits relative to the U.S. Dental market. On the consumables side, we see it really as a continuing relatively modest growth market. You\u2019ve seen pretty consistent low single-digit growth from us. We do -- we have seen some inventory de-stocking in the latter part of last year that maybe carrying over here in the first part of this year, but generally that our business has continues to perform pretty well and what arguably is kind a slow growth macro environment there. Time will tell us to whether or not some of this reduction in oil prices that will translate to cost of filling up a tank ends up improving overall consumer sentiment and give us a little tailwind there, but, boy, probably too early to tell. Brandon Couillard : Superb. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Thank you. I guess, first of all, I just wanted to see if there was any change in the expectations on core growth by segment for 2015, given you had a pretty good core growth quarter in Q4? And also just on Industrial Tech specifically, you had the highest growth rate pool since mid-2011, similar growth rate in Q3, but a tougher base, so maybe some updates on that? Dan Comas : Julian, I would say that PID, clearly, the biggest piece of Industrial Tech continues to perform quite well. I don't think they\u2019re really looking for change in that growth trajectory here in 2015. In the first quarter as we highlighted, we think we\u2019ll do 4% or better. Again, we're talking 3% to 4% for the full year. Our internal numbers right now are rolling up around 4% for the first quarter, but as Tom alluded to, we finished Q4 pretty strong and we\u2019re off to a very good start here in the first three weeks of January. We also have some extra days here in the first quarter that should be a benefit as well. I think the offset there are two of those extra days are the Thursday and Friday before Easter, which tends to be kind of slow days. Japan which was a big grower last year ahead of the bad increase we\u2019ll likely be down here in Q1 year-on-year. And as we allude in the call, we expect our tech comp, this will be the last we think really poor quarter for that business similar to what we saw in the second half of 2015. We\u2019re encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of bookings but from shipments we are going to have a tough Q1 as well. But all up, things are looking pretty good out of the gate here or early in the first quarter. Julian Mitchell : Thanks and then just secondly. When you talked about the Q1 EPS guidance, I think that was a comment around some M&A charges being excluded. I just wondered if I\u2019d misheard that or if there was anything new in terms of sort of presentation of adjusted earnings? Tom Joyce : That is correct. I mean consistent with our past practice for deals that are over $1 billion, we call out kind of the early charges, large non-cash charges. So we still have a little bit left in Nobel in the first quarter. And I think that will be about $0.02. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Tom Joyce : Thanks Julian. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning guys. Tom Joyce : Good morning Scott. Scott Davis : And excuse me, I doubt in about 10 minutes later if you commented on price and I apologize but is there -- I mean I know your raw material costs are generally lower and it\u2019s not a big deal for you guys, but are you out there with price increases for 2015 or broadly? Tom Joyce : Scott, if you think about where your question might go specifically , geographically it might go to Europe. And interestingly, we are outperforming in Europe. We think we are taking share in Europe. We saw a broad-based performance across the businesses in Europe. And so no particular concern there. I think teams are clearly looking very selectively market by market. These currency shifts have not been exclusively in Europe. They\u2019ve been in quite a number of markets. Generally we are pretty well positioned in terms of the functional currency that we transact in. But where there are issues, our teams are carefully looking at those situations and we\u2019ll take price very selectively where we need to or compete on price, if it comes to that. Scott Davis : I mean, I guess I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but do you anticipate having positive price for 2015 on an ongoing basis? Tom Joyce : Yes, Scott. And again -- where we will get that, in all likelihood will be the 40% of revenues that comes out in the aftermarket. Scott Davis : Yeah. That\u2019s what I was alluding to if you are in -- if you are already out there, catalogs et cetera with price increases? Tom Joyce : Oh yeah. No that\u2019s absolutely right Scott. That -- Those plans were locked and loaded in the fourth quarter and we are on the street, virtually across the businesses right now with those plans and in the market with those numbers. Scott Davis : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, inverse of Jeff\u2019s question on private equity and competition I mean have you seen the opposite, which means private equity I think for probably the last five years have been buying up industrial and even some healthcare assets. I mean, have you seen those guys come back to the table and say it's -- they are looking to start unloading? Dan Comas : Scott, they are always in the market place and clearly there are assets out there held in the hands of private equity that we would have some interest in. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s gotten better or worse here recently, those discussions. Scott Davis : Okay. And last, last but not least I mean I know you changed your -- the cash earnings. Have you changed internally your hurdle rates at all? I mean historically you guys have had a pretty strict discipline around hurdle rates. I am just wondering and given your lower financing costs as such if that\u2019s dropped at all? Tom Joyce : Scott, we have not changed our internal hurdle rates, that discipline that we've had over a long period of time remains internally around returns for bolt-ons at three years and broad -- and bigger, larger, more adjacent businesses, new businesses over a five year period. That is discipline has been really important to the overall performance that we\u2019ve demonstrated. What we have said is that we want to be thoughtful and cognitive in this environment relative to what might be larger transaction that could have significant strategic value for the corporation, where we might need to take a hard look at those returns and the team here and the board. We support making the right decision strategically for the corporation in the event that those returns maybe not where they we might like them to be. But that\u2019s the bridge we\u2019ll cross when we have that opportunity. And we\u2019ll make the right decision that really drives the long-term strategic competitive advantage of platform or our segment. Scott Davis : Okay. Great. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks guys. Tom Joyce : Thanks Scott. Operator : And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning guys. Tom Joyce : Hey Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yeah. So just couple of questions on core growth pretty strong performance across the portfolio ex-T&M but you self alluding to market share gains. It sounds like \u201815 Europe. And I am just wondering is that the case Tom and which businesses would you call out where you are gaining share and perhaps may be if you could comment on whether we are seeing the delayed impact from some of the R&D and marketing investments you have made over the last 12 months? Tom Joyce : We are continuing to make those investments, Nigel, in sales and marketing and in R&D as I noted in my opening comments. The good performance on the topline and the good gross margin expansion that we\u2019ve seen has allowed us to continue to invest aggressively in growth initiatives around both new product innovation and go-to market, feet on the street. The share gains, as we noted earlier were pretty broad based. And, yes, they were, in some cases specifically in Europe, couple of the businesses that I mentioned earlier were around our life science platform, our dental equipment business and Product ID, just to name of few. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. And then we\u2019ve seen consumables leading the way on topline, I guess this cycle, with equipment lagging behind. Are we seeing any change, I mean, just seeing or hearing about the comments from U.S and Europe, particularly in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, are we seen an inflection point in equipment? Tom Joyce : We definitely saw a modestly better Q3 and a definitely better Q4 in terms of equipment. So if you look at our 4%, we were 5% aftermarket in 3, or maybe is a little bit over 3 on the equipment side. And that\u2019s one of the better numbers we posted on equipment and that includes our communications business, which came down mid-teens. So if you adjust for that, our equipment business was probably up more like 4 plus. So we are not quite prepared to kind of call it a trend here, but we are encouraged by what we've seen for last four, five months in terms of our overall equipment orders. Nigel Coe : And that 4%-ex comes would be, with the best in how many years? Tom Joyce : Probably, you have to go back to the \u201811 recovery. Nigel Coe : Okay. Middle implicate, right. And then just going back to the comments on the M&A process, little bit of FX and emerging market volatilities, does one that will shake the complacency of sellers? Are you seen any kind of change out from sellers? Are they a bit off spread something now? Tom Joyce : No, as you know, a lot of this has been just in the last 30, 45 days, I think it\u2019s a little early to tell but it\u2019s hard not to be a little bit more optimistic. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Tom. Operator : And we will take your next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Tom Joyce : Hi, Andrew. Dan Comas : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a broader long-term question. If I look at the emerging markets, what\u2019s happening in Russia and Brazil, people are talking about euro going to parity. Do you think you need to change anything about your strategy about your manufacturing footprint for the next several years? Even China is growing at 6%. I\u2019m not sure when was the last time that happened? Tom Joyce : Andrew, we\u2019ve got a long history of moving manufacturing into lower-cost regions. Not all of that has been into China. In some cases, it\u2019s been into Eastern Europe. In some cases, it has been into India and we\u2019ll continue to position our cost structure, I think in a way that is resilient over the long-term. I think we want to be a little careful not to change our supply chain prematurely or in a disruptive way, not knowing kind of what maybe the sustained currency position is ultimately going to be. So, I think the teams are doing exceptional job positioning that footprint well for the long-term. And it\u2019s not all about the individual or the cost of individual region. It\u2019s also about the way we execute in any region. And I think we\u2019ve got a number of examples where our business is where that you might say are in higher cost operating regions. In fact, continued to deliver exceptional profitability and have a real competitive advantage because of their cost structures despite their regional positions. So, I think we feel pretty good about where we are. Andrew Obin : That\u2019s very fair. And just a follow-up question on free cash flow. What should we expect for FY \u201815 versus $3.2 billion you did in \u201914, or if you want to talk about cash flow realization? Dan Comas : It is our early year. We are very pleased with the way we ended the year in terms of free cash flow. So, I think we would be in the sort of zone here. Again, we have got a benefit in \u201914, given our cash tax rate was fair amount lower than our actual provision for the year. It\u2019s probably too early to kind of make a call on that, where we stand right now. Andrew Obin : But relatively flat is a good sort of hold for now in the mind. Dan Comas : I think that\u2019s a good starting point. Andrew Obin : Thank you so much. Tom Joyce : Thanks Andrew Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I\u2019d now like turn the program back over to Matt Gugino for any closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Aaron. We\u2019ll be around all day for questions. Thanks for joining us everyone. Operator : This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at any time.",

With that, I like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. We were pleased by our solid start to 2015. The team executed well in a changing and challenging macro environment using the Danaher Business System to drive strong organic revenue growth and expand core margins in the quarter. DBS continues to enhance our competitive position and drive share gains across the portfolio by helping us identify, direct, and execute on high impact investments in product innovation and sales and marketing. As a result, seven of our nine strategic platforms grew at a mid-single-digit rate or better in the quarter including test and measurement instruments, water quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences, Product ID and Automation. We were also encouraged by the noticeable impact DBS has already made on many of our recent acquisitions including Nobel Biocare, Devicor and Aguasin that further boosted our performance. This is another record first quarter for Danaher, adjusted, diluted net earnings per share was $0.93 including a negative $0.02 impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar versus our previously communicated guidance in January. Revenues for the quarter grew 4.5% to $4.9 billion with core revenues up 5% due in part to extra selling days in the quarter. This growth exceeded our expectations and marks our best quarterly core growth performance since 2011. Acquisitions contributed 6% to revenues, while currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 6.5%. Geographically, the high-growth markets grew mid-single digits, but performance was mixed as strength in China and India was offset by weakness in Russia and Latin America. In China, sales increased nearly 10% led by our dental, diagnostics, and Gilbarco Veeder-Root platforms. The developed market also grew at a mid-single-digit rate with both the U.S. and Europe up mid-single digits. In Japan as expected, sales declined double digits due to a difficult prior-year comparison in which customers accelerated purchases ahead of the VAT increase on April 1, 2014. Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 53.4% marking the first time our gross margins have exceeded 53%. Core operating margin expanded 25 basis points or approximately 60 basis points excluding the impact of foreign currency. With three of our five segments improving more than 110 basis points. Our reported operating margin was 15.9%. On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus. We deployed approximately $500 million on three bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter including the acquisition of the Siemens Microbiology business. These acquisitions strengthened our market positions in our dental, diagnostics, and Product ID platforms. In February, we also increased our annual dividend by 35% to $0.54 per share and we expect further increases over time. Our tremendous balance sheet and active acquisition funnel combined with recent volatility in the global volatility markets uniquely positions us to deploy our substantial M&A capacity. Turning to our five operating segments. Test and measurement revenues declined 1.5% with core revenues up 2.5%. Reported operating margin decreased 220 basis points and core operating margin declined 225 basis points largely due to lower sales in our higher gross margin communications platform. Core revenues in our instruments platform grew mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter led by the developed markets and China. Fluke core revenues were up high single digits as it's biomedical and tomography product lines each increased double digits. Strengthen in tomography was augmented by the launch of the TiX560 and TiX520 series of thermal imaging cameras during the quarter. This expert series combines in articulating lens, on camera analytics and the industries largest responsive LCD touch screen allowing mechanical engineers to navigate over, under and around objects to quickly capture process and process the highest quality infrared images on the spot. At Tektronix, our core revenues increased at a mid single-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter. Healthy demand for military and government customers in North America was coupled with strength in the semiconductor segment in China. During the quarter, Tektronix introduced new type of high-performance ATI oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce noise and distortion so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most common complex problems. Core revenues from our communications platform decreased at a double-digit rate. Double-digit growth in security solutions and high single-digit growth at Fluke Networks was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions. Platform orders grew over 20% in the quarter, which gives us confidence that we will achieve positive core growth in 2015. We continue to expect the combination of our communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015 and this morning we announced that NetScout has received clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the proposed transaction. Close is subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and other customary closing conditions. Moving to our environmental segment, revenues increased 7% with core revenues up 8.5%. Core operating margin expanded 175 basis points while reported operating margin was up 60 basis points to 19.5%. Our water quality platforms core revenues grew approximately 10% with robust growth in our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet treatment businesses. Hach had an outstanding quarter with growth across most major product lines. Sales in the U.S. and Europe grew double digits as the team's application of DBS growth tools such as funnel management and transformative marketing continued to drive share gains. We've built on this momentum by launching our breakthrough water quality testing system the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, or PPA in over 40 countries. Notably the PPA's ease-of-use has a ready started to change the way our customers perform critical water quality tests making it one of the most important new products in the market. At ChemTreat, we saw a robust demand for our chemical treatment solutions and services in both North America and Latin America. ChemTreat's consistently strong performance is a direct result of its targeted investment in Feet-on-the-Street and development of its best-in-class sales force. The ChemTreat team has done a fantastic job implementing this approach in Latin America with its most recent acquisition Aguasin, which grew more than 20% in the quarter. Gilbarco Veeder-Root crew midfielder gets driven by strength in China and the U.S. In U.S., upcoming EMV regulation changes drove over 20% growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We're pleased that customers have continued to make Gilbarco their supplier of choice when implementing these necessary payment system upgrades. Turning now to Life Sciences and Diagnostics. Revenues grew 2% with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 115 basis points and reported operating margin was 12.7%, which was negatively impacted by one-time non-cash charges related to the recently closed acquisitions of Devicor and the Siemens Microbiology business, which is now known as Beckman Coulter MicroScan. Core revenues in our diagnostics platform grew at a mid-single-digit rate. At Beckman Coulter diagnostics, core sales were up mid-single digits led by double-digit growth in our immunoassay and urinalysis product lines. In the U.S., increasing customer utilization and higher win and retention rates help drive mid single-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter. This improvement in win and retention rates is as an example of the team's persistent focus on product innovation and enhancing the customer experience over the past 3plus years. Beckman Coulter is a fantastic example of how thoughtful application of DBS growth, lean and leadership tools can make a good company even better. We hope you'll join us in Vallejo, California for our Investor and Analyst event in June to hear more of this terrific story. In January, Beckman closed the previously announced acquisition of MicroScan. MicroScan expands our well-established footprint in hospitals and reference labs with a suite of highly accurate automated instruments and consumables that help identify infection causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments. Radiometer's core sales increased high single digits, its13th consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better. Demand was solid across all product lines led by double-digit growth in blood gas and AQT consumables. During the quarter, we expanded our AQT testing menu in Europe with the launch of procalcitonin assay or PCT. PCT detects life-threatening sepsis infections on site in operating rooms and other critical care centers enabling doctors to provide timely antibiotic treatments and ultimately save more lives. Sales at Leica Biosystems were up high single digits led by Advanced Staining, which grew over 20% in the quarter. We posted double-digit growth in the U.S. where the stabilizing reimbursement environment resulted in improved capital spending. We were also encouraged by a strong start at Devicor, an acquisition we closed last December where reinvigorated product portfolio and implementation of DBS tools, helps to drive approximately 10% growth in the quarter. Core sales in our Life Science platform increased mid-single digits with solid performance in the U.S. and Europe. Notably we saw China sales return to growth in the quarter. SCIEX score sales grew double digits led by strength in clinical and applied end markets. Strong commercial execution and investments in new products have resulted in meaningful share gains over the past several quarters. Leica Microsystems core sales declined mid-single digits due to impart to a difficult comparison in Japan where we saw a record shipments ahead of last year's VAT increase. Despite the sales decline, we are confident in Leica steady stream of new product innovation including the DMi8 inverted microscope platform that launched during the quarter. The DMi8 improves customer workflow for industrial applications by enabling users to prepare and change samples more quickly than with traditional microscopes. It also features a configurable design providing one solution for both basic and advanced industrial users. Turning to Dental; our dental revenue increased 30% with core revenues down slightly due in part to lower volumes related to inventory destocking within our U.S. distribution channels. This occurred across many of our higher-margin product lines and combined with our continued investments in sales and marketing and product development resulted in a 385 basis point core operating margin decline. Robust demand in high growth markets and strength in our orthodontic and value implant solutions were more than offset by the previously mentioned inventory destocking. That said, we are encouraged by improving sellout data we're seeing in the U.S. market and believe the business will show improving growth trends throughout the course of the year. Nobel Biocare completed his first full quarter with Danaher and we've made great progress so far while it's still early, we were encouraged by Nobel's mid-single digit average daily sales growth for the quarter. One of Danaher's core values innovation defines our future, certainly rang true at the Biannual International Dental Show in March, where KaVo Kerr Group and Nobel Biocare launched much more than 35 new or updated products. The innovations unveiled ran the full spectrum of dental care from digital imaging to treatment units to consumables. Notably, attendees were able to preview our first integrated Chairside CAD/CAM solution which will allow dentists to design and manufacture custom prosthetics quickly and easily in their offices. In Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 2.5% with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin increased 210 basis points to 24.6%. Automation core revenues increased mid-single digits as continued growth in our industrial automation, North American distribution and medical end markets was partially offset by weakness in agriculture. This represents the platform's best quarterly performance since early 2011. Product Identification core revenues increased high single digits with robust demand for our marking and coding color management and software solutions. Videojet had a solid start to the year delivering high single-digit growth as our substantial and growing installed base continues to drive broad share gains. The team delivered mid-single-digit growth or better in all major geographies with particular strength in Western Europe, China and India. During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1620 and1650 high-resolution micro-printers that enable fast, high-quality printing on very small surfaces. This technology is essential in such industries as electronics and personal care where legibility and clarity are critical because consumer safety and industry regulations. In March, Esko acquired MediaBeacon a leader in digital asset management software. MediaBeacon saves our customers time and money by allowing them to store repurpose and share their digital media efficiently across projects departments and channels. Bringing together these specialized companies equips us better to serve our global network of customers and meet a growing industry demand for more integrated packaging and artwork management tools. So to wrap up, we had a very good start to 2015 delivering our highest quarter of core revenue growth since 2011. The team's solid execution using Danaher business system continued to drive relative out-performance and enhanced our competitive position. We remain cognizant of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a changing macro environment. However, we're confident that our focus on optimizing our portfolio and seizing high-impact growth opportunities will help us build a better, stronger Danaher in 2015 and the years to come. We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes core revenue growth of 3% to 4%. We are also updating our full-year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.23 to $4.33. We expect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our fourth quarter earnings release in January to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.07 per share. We continue to expect core revenue growth between 3% and 4% for the full year 2015. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Lisa, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Scott Davis of Barclays. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : And ask a little of FX and I think we understand the impact of translation, I think most people do at least for the group overall, but what does that FX really mean for you guys as it relates to global competition, does it change how you think about where you produce and where you ship out over, there is a change or impact of price dynamic at all, or is it really not much of an impact? Tom Joyce : Well, Scott, I guess we first start and think about FX from a competitive perspective. And it's hard not to think the competitive dynamics shift a little bit in certain markets where the U.S. dollar has strengthened against that local currency. That being said, let's take Europe for example. We continue to perform exceptionally well there we have during the entire shift of the currency, we have seen solid mid-single-digit growth in that market. We know that market generally across a number of our businesses is probably more of a low single-digit market on a core growth business. And so we're continuing to perform exceptionally well and taking share there. You can look at Japan as another example where those ships have happened and certainly there has been some modest shifts in the competitive dynamics there, but again, our businesses generally in spite of a very challenging environment there. Overall, we haven't seen really any meaningful shifts in the competitive dynamics and we're continuing to perform well. So we start there and think about competitiveness. Relative to the overall operational footprint, we're going to see currencies move up and we are going to see currencies move down, it takes quite a while to shift your manufacturing footprint. And the day you think you got that right is a day of currency might turn against you and you end up in a very different place than you would hope. So in general, over a long period of time, we've had a balanced footprint that is provided a certain level of natural hedge for us. Obviously, the shifts here have been far more dramatic and therefore the impacts have read through -- through the P&L. So we continue to put ourselves in the best position possible from an operational footprint putting manufacturing operations in, in the best costs positions that we can with the best logistics and supply chains. But these shifts do not cause any knee-jerk reactions on our part in terms of a repositioning. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on dental. I guess I don't remember a time were you had, I'm going to call it flattish core growth where you saw, it looks like in the slides core margins down 385 bps was that just a mixed impact of the higher margin step being destocked or is there some other step in there like restructuring or anything else. Tom Joyce : It really starts with the volume itself. And that volume being slightly up in one side of the business slightly down in another side of the business, but generally it starts with that volume position and then the destocking, yes, in fact was the primary driver relative to the higher-margin products being the areas where we very cooperatively and teaming with our distribution channels made very conscious decision about what we needed to do in the channel from an inventory perspective. I think what's really important to recognize about that situation is that we track sellout very, very closely with those distribution partners. And we are very encouraged by what we see from a sellout perspective. So we're confident in our competitive positions we understand that we are performing well, those distribution partnerships are working very effectively. This has been going on for a period of time now. We think we're getting towards the end of that. Q2 is probably more of a transition quarter and we are optimistic that we will see better growth going forward. But back to your question around the margins, it's really that combination of volume and negative mix. Now one last point there because we're confident in our competitive position because in a number of areas particularly outside the U.S., the dental platform is performing extremely well driving anywhere from mid-single digit in certain markets like China growing double digit. We continue to invest in that business. Investing in new products, you heard me talk about the 35 new products across the platform. Investing in sales and marketing, so while we've got some headwind there in terms of doing the right things relative to the channel, we're confident that those investments are going to pay off as time goes on. Scott Davis : Okay. Great answer. Thanks guys I will pass it on. Tom Joyce : Thanks Scott. Operator : And we will go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can we get more into the specs of the TiBX thermal imaging camera for a second. Tom Joyce : I love the high hard ones. Steve Tusa : On the R&D and SG&A both up in the quarter. Was there some little bit of a discretionary loading, if you saw the organic growth come through there or is that just kind of normal course? Tom Joyce : Steve, I would say that we set a course to continue to invest in the highest impact opportunities that we saw from a product development standpoint as well as from a go-to-market standpoint. So we set that course quite a while ago. We had terrific reviews last fall in our strategic plan reviews. I think we got a good sense of where those opportunities were. And I think on a discretionary basis, we made the call in a number of places where we knew we were doing well, we knew that as things got choppy, continuing to invest and stay the course would ultimately prove out to our benefit on a long-term basis. I think one of the areas I'd point to specifically to that staying that course would be in Europe. Again, where we've seen the slower growth environment and where we've continued to perform above market rates in most of our businesses and that's largely a function of staying the course from an investment standpoint. It's true today also in our high-growth markets were we have seen a few of our markets on site specifically Latin America specifically Brazil and Mexico, where we've got some challenges there, but we're continuing to stay the course from an investment standpoint. But also making some thoughtful decisions about shifting investments carefully where there is higher growth opportunities and there's some countries right now in Latin America where the teams are doing a terrific job shifting that investment. Stay in the course in China, right now as well staying the course in India from an investment standpoint both of those countries paying off very well for us across a number of platforms. So staying the course making some discretionary choices even when the temptation is to pull back hard to make sure we take advantage of what's choppy environment. Steve Tusa : And so I guess on that I'm getting to something in a range of 25% to 30% core incremental for the quarter, which usually you guys is more like 35% to 40%, I mean should that migrate higher over the course of the year, or are we in kind of, are we in a straight off now where organic growth is going to be higher maybe we should expect a little bit lower incremental? Dan Comas : Steve, I think there are a couple of things going on, some of which Tom alluded to where we are confident we're taking share, we want to sustain those investments. I think the second element is we're having pretty high fall through on the FX hit. We talked about the fall through on FX has been closer to 22% to 23%, so we are feeling some impact on that. But I think it's a combination, but as we went through the quarter and saw the strength, we saw some opportunity to step up some of the investments. And we will navigate that carefully, but if we're in this mode of outperforming vis-\u00e0-vis competition we probably going to take a little more latitude on investors. Steve Tusa : Okay. And day sales impact on the quarter that's my final one. Thanks. Dan Comas : And probably, I think the five is probably closer to a four, when you look at days adjusted, which again would be consistent with what we put up in Q4. Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks a lot. Tom Joyce : Thanks Steve. Operator : And we will next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Thanks. And good morning all. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker : Yes. I have no thermal camera imaging questions you can't top that. So let's see, just -- I think from a high level here stepping back for a second, this is another quarter of solid core growth, you guys have been putting us up and talking about gaining share quarter-after-quarter for a long period of time, now. And I'm just trying to get a sense going forward as of the business model and the extent to which that in these higher gross margins, you think are sustainable or a function more of the cyclical markets think you're in a new norm at this point? How are you looking at that Tom and Dan? Tom Joyce : Steve, I think we do think that the trajectory that we are on is sustainable. Clearly, we're in some challenging macroeconomic times here. But again, we feel like the investments that we're making in the right places are driving core growth in a number of our businesses and translating into those share gains. And those are also businesses where we have a got \u2013 where we do have good gross margins and we always look at those gross margins and the improvement of those gross margins as indicative of higher value propositions that we're delivering to our customers those are sometimes value propositions associated with new product innovation; sometimes they're associated with improvements in our technical service and support, our ability to get price across a number of our markets. So this is the model of the Danaher that we are working on building quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. So that's the way we tend to think about it. And I'll extend that by the way to the way we think about capital allocation, is looking at businesses and opportunities in the market that represent those same characteristics. Good growth opportunities across global markets. High brand preference to professional and users representing solid gross margins and the ability to build sustainable business models with strong consumable streams that really speak to a level of resilience and ultimately competitive advantage. So that's the playbook. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then let me ask the obligatory M&A question following your capital deployment point, which is a little bit different though this time, right, we are hearing commentary from other CEOs on how pricey they view the current environment. So how are you thinking about that how is your outlook changing, if at all? Tom Joyce : I don't know that our outlook has changed very much Steve over the last couple of quarters. Clearly outstanding businesses with a number of the characteristics that I mentioned just a few minutes ago are our assets that are well-valued in the marketplace. And those assets while highly valued tend to be outstanding businesses with great long-term opportunities for growth. So I'm not sure we've seen much change in that, but we continue to be very encouraged by the conversations we're having and the funnels that we have across the businesses we have made some progress here in the first quarter deploying $0.5 billion and we are optimistic about more to come. Steven Winoker : Okay. Great. See you in Brea. Thanks. Tom Joyce : Thank Steve. Dan Comas : Thanks Steve. Operator : And we will go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yes. I just want to come back to the dental destock. Inventory movements are something we've heard from other companies. It doesn't feel like it was elsewhere, but did you see any of that dynamic elsewhere across the portfolio. Tom Joyce : Nigel, I can't think of \u2013 not to suggest there couldn't be a pocket here or there, but in general anything material across any of the other segments, I would say no. We're not hearing much of anything in that regard. Nigel Coe : Okay. And I just want to pick up on Steve's points on capital allocation rather than thermal imaging. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ambition to keep raising dividends and is that an ambition to raise a dividend payout ratio or dividend in line with earnings. Dan Comas : Nigel, I think the expectation that we would in the intermediate term, continue to raise it faster than overall earnings and cash flow growth. But that's not within expectation of sort of getting to a market yield, but getting to a more meaningful yield. Nigel Coe : Okay. And you have a target payout ratio over time? TomJoyce: Well, I mean if you think of the market 2% to 2.5% may be if we were half of that in time, 3 to 5 years that might not be a bad place to be. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. And then just finally congratulations on the news on the NetScout transaction this morning. Is the impact of that transaction built into \u2013 I know it's not built into organic growth guidance, but is it baked into your EPS outlook and how do you expect the EPS impact of that transaction to play out? Dan Comas : Nigel, first of all, very good news, I mean that really is the long pole in the tent to get to closing still some other a few other things we need to get through, but it's much more common today that we get to a close here early in the summer. It is not factored in. A lot of that will depend ultimately whether we do a spin or a split. Based where their stock is trading today if we did a split, on an annual basis, it would approximately wash. So the earnings we would get \u2013 we would give up there would reduce our share count and would be roughly an equal offset. Now that may impact first half second half, but an annual basis would be roughly a full offset. Nigel Coe : And core growth accretive by about 50 bps in the second half of the year? Thanks. Dan Comas : While as we mentioned orders are very good in the communications business in the first quarter and the last couple of quarters, quarters are up 20%. So I don't think it necessarily will be accretive to revenue growth in the back half, it would be accretive in the first half on a pro forma basis, but wouldn't expect that to impact the second half of that business is definitely building. Nigel Coe : Okay. Very good. Thanks Dan. Operator : We will go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Tom Joyce : Hi, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the mix between equipment and consumable growth? And then on the equipment side specifically, you talked about the product innovation sales and marketing clearly you are getting some share in some places, but it seems like other guys are also struggling just with customers' willingness to spend right now. And it seems like you're overcoming that can you just maybe give a little sense of what you're hearing from customers as you're having more success getting them to step up and buy. Tom Joyce : Shannon, we're very encouraged by what we see in the balance of growth both in the equipment and the consumable side. Both of those \u2013 both sides have posting good growth. That obviously bodes well for continued performance because as we build that install base, across the number of the businesses those annuities streams that accrue to the consumables business obviously are very important to the resiliency of the business model and also to margins. Relative to your question about customers willing to spend in CapEx, I would say we have a number of examples where even in challenging markets our teams are performing quite well and seeing great penetrations in terms of the installed base, I would point to the Videojet business and the performance there. The continued growth of that installed base in the consumable stream. Clearly, what we've seen on the diagnostic side a little bit more favorable environment in terms of diagnostic utilization. The macro indicators around the healthcare market are improving marginally quarter-over-quarter. So we're seeing a little bit of loosening in capital spent in hospital environment. As I mentioned, we saw the first quarter returning to growth in Life Science in China, which is also encouraging that's more of an equipment market than a consumables market. So I think there's a number of places we point to where we're seeing our teams execute extremely well in gaining share driving and installed base without necessarily strong tailwinds from market perspectives. Dan Comas : And Shannon we were in the quarter equipment we were up mid-single-digit, which was the best quarter we've had in equipment we probably have to go back maybe almost 2011. Shannon O'Callaghan: Interesting. All right, thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on CID, so Videojet clearly still gaining from share, but overall that market actually just seems like one of the better places to be right now. Is there \u2013 are there certain verticals that are particularly good there or favorable things you're seeing in the overall market. Tom Joyce : I think Videojet has performed pretty well across a number of their verticals. When you look at \u2013 for the food market, when we look at the beverage market broadly defined packaging overall, clearly a very competitive market, but one where the Videojet team both through a combination of product innovation and a number of improvements using DBS growth tools have driven an enhanced go-to-market model. There clearly gaining share. And they have over an extended period of time. If we look back really through the cycle VJ has continued to perform above the market growth rates on a consistent basis and again a combination of product innovation and go-to-market execution really has contributed there. But yes, I think to the vertical end markets they are good, steady, verticals and VJ is taking advantage of those. Shannon O'Callaghan: Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : We will go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Thank you. Tom Joyce : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments beginning a changing macro environment because your tone across the businesses sounds pretty good. So I just wondered if you're seeing that changing macro play into your own orders today in parts of T&M or industrial tech. And maybe just any color on how sort of in recent months, you've seen the short cycle industrial demand moving. Tom Joyce : Sure. I think when we talk about the macro, it's probably easiest to articulate that Julian on a geographic basis. And some of the changes that we've seen have clearly been in Latin America for one where we have seen some significant weakening in that market. Clearly Russia again a much smaller position fortunately for us, but a challenging market there. China while still a very good market we are performing quite well in that market. You've obviously read the headlines about a little bit of softening there from GDP growth rates of the past. So we see those shift, on the other side, we've seen some geographic markets improve. India being one, again, teams performing quite well there. So I think that's one way to look at it. Europe is still steady, but again, we think we are outperforming in that market. So I think those would be a few of the things that we would point to. On the short cycle industrial side, really Dan \u2013 Daniels teams a number of those businesses automation we talked to a little while ago really are performing very well. And that's really just a function again of I think a combination of new product innovation in a number of places as well as is good day today go-to-market execution. Dan Comas : And Julian, I would add \u2013 just you asked about very recently. I think similar to some other companies, we did seeing some pockets in March in the U.S., particularly in the U.S. in the equipment a little bit of softness, it's hard to tell if it's any trend through the first half of April we are pretty much in line here. But if there was any slight shift here in the last 4 to 6 weeks I would say the U.S. equipment piece is slightly weaker. Julian Mitchell : Great. And then just my second question around the sort of relative appeal of valuations for acquisition in the healthcare and sort of non-healthcare sides of the business. Particularly I guess with regards to industrial tech was certainly on organic growth you see on a much more stronger footing today, how you seeing evaluations in that arena and is that area somewhat more attractive now because we've got the core really firing again. Dan Comas : Julian, its overall pretty balanced as Tom alluded to nothings inexpensive right now. But there are some good assets out there both on the healthcare on the industrial side that we are active around. I wouldn't put up a highlight more to one space versus the other. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman : Yes. Good morning. Tom Joyce : Hey, Rich. Richard Eastman : Can I just \u2013 Tom, could you just double back for a second on the dental business, I'm curious within North America with the destocking phenomenon that you saw here in the quarter given consumer incomes up and disposable personal income is up and spending is up. I'm curious, is there anything structural in North America on the dental side of your business that's creating the destock, and maybe you could share with us just with the sell-through stats are that you are watching. TomJoyce: Rich, I would not say there's anything structural about our business or our position relative to the North American market. We would agree that the market is improving marginally based on a couple of the things you mentioned around consumer spending and discretionary income and so on. This is more a cooperative agreement with our distribution partners where we've \u2013 where we're working with them to ensure the channels are right-sized from an inventory perspective. From a sell-through perspective, we see mid-single-digit are moving from low single-digit to the lower end of mid-single-digit kind of sell-through coming out of the channels to the end user. So and we know that based on how our products are performing specifically as well as how the categories are improving. So that reinforces our belief that we are well-positioned and that there's nothing structurally going against us in terms of our position in the market. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just a quick question for Dan as a follow-up. It appears to me we do some discount basic math against the TechComms, NetScout transaction as its pending and given NetScout's stock price and may be TechComms EBIT as it finished the year in 2014, is there a scenario where this plays out that that transaction and the buyback given NetScout valuation here that buyback of Danaher shares that that's actually accretive to EPS? Because it looks like you could use a math that would show maybe $0.10 accretion from that transaction. Dan Comas : Rick, if you look backwards, if we would've closed the deal given the respective stock prices are today and we did a split looking backwards it would be accretive. But because of the building backlog in order book, if I look over the next 12 months it would be about a wash. Richard Eastman : Okay. Dan Comas : We are going to be \u2013 we were down double-digit Q4 down to double-digit Q1, we expect better performance probably getting to around flat here in the second quarter, but given what we are seeing in the order book and the backlog, we expect growth in the back half year when you factor that in, it changes the economics and the buyback a little bit. Richard Eastman : Okay. I see. Okay, all right. Well, thank you. Tom Joyce : Thanks Rich. Operator : And we will go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Good morning, guys. Thank you. Question about Europe. I think you guys said that it had mid-single-digit growth in that region and it's slightly outpaced the end market growth like-for-like. So I was curious, if you could maybe give us a little color as to where you think the implied share gains are happening. Tom Joyce : Thanks Isaac. They're coming in a number of places. Clearly in our environmental segment, performance at Hach would be one of the places that would we point to that's done an excellent job. Again, a continued focus on investment in that market both in terms of new products as well as in terms of Feet-on-the-Street. I think a good example there also of approaching those investments across multiple verticals are end markets. So strength in both the municipal side and interesting particularly on the industrial side. So I think good performance there. The PID business particularly Videojet, I think continuing to perform well there. So it's fairly broad based. Isaac Ro : Got it. Okay. And then just may be a bit more of an open ended question on capital allocation. Just sort of curious, if you could talk to the extent that your deal funnel has evolved since you took over in the last fall, any things you could really highlight to help us appreciate how you are looking at acquisitions going forward just general themes that might help us appreciate what you're doing. Tom Joyce : Sure. I think what we are really trying to do Isaac as we look at markets and companies in those markets platform by platform is ensure that we are looking for the best opportunities to strengthen our existing platforms strategically. I mentioned when we were together in December that we are much more focused on the existing five segments and nine strategic platforms as they exist today and going deeper into those individual segments strengthening each of them in terms of their competitive positions as opposed to going wider to the right or to the left. So I think that's probably the primary focus that we have across each of the platforms is looking for the best opportunities to strengthen our positions in the markets in which we participate today. You see a couple of examples there recently, right? You look at Siemens micro, how that strengthened our position at Beckman. If you look at Devicor, how that strengthened our position in the workflow of anatomical pathology. Most recently MediaBeacon in our PID platform and the way that strengthened the value proposition of managing digital assets to brand owners all good examples of strengthening a competitive position in the places we play today. Isaac Ro : Got it. Thanks a bunch. Tom Joyce : Thanks Isaac. Operator : And we will go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning guys. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on environmental. Could you just talk a little bit more detail core growth was just really strong. How much of it was end market dynamics and how much of it was you guys just taking market share or putting new products into the market. Dan Comas : Well, particularly and water quality where were up almost double-digit. It's very hard to think the market is growing more than 3% to 5%. As Tom alluded to we were exceptionally strong in Europe up over double-digit. Again, at least for the quarter that would probably be at least 2X what the market grew in that quarter. Andrew Obin : Got you. And as I look at Life Science and Diagnostics once again core growth just seems to accelerate. Why would, can you talk about the momentum until the second quarter and second half of the year, particularly it seems U.S. consumer is improving with lower energy prices or at least it should improve. Why would core growth slow down into the second half during given those fundamentals and given that Beckman Coulter has very nice momentum at this point. Dan Comas : Andrew, I'm not sure we're suggesting much of a slowdown we were a little bit over 5% and as we said in December and January, 3% to 4% of the year that segment could be more in that 4% to 5% range. Andrew Obin : Got you. But what I'm saying is why, sorry just to rephrase. It just seems that 5% could be sustainable or better given the consumer trend and given Beckman Coulter finally executing quite well. That's what I don't -- Tom Joyce : We are certainly on a good trajectory there. It is also probably important just to know quickly that there was an impact of days here in the first quarter we have a high proportion of certainly the diagnostic business that is represented on the consumable side of the house and the consumable side of the house is where you get a little bit more of the bump on a days basis. So there's a little bit of a factor there Andrew as well. Andrew Obin : Got you. Thank you very much. Tom Joyce : Thank you. Operator : And it appears we have time for one more question. We will go to our last question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Thanks good morning. Tom Joyce : Hi, Brandon Brandon Couillard : Tom with respect to the Life Science business in China, could you quantify the growth in the period. And perhaps peel back the onion in terms of where you saw the strength and do you feel like the research budget is particularly around high-end instrumentation are maybe starting to loosening up a little bit? Tom Joyce : Thanks Brandon. We saw a mid-single-digit growth in China and Life Science. Again the first really good signs of life there in terms of growth in the last few quarters. So we are encouraged by that. I think we've reached a point of probably stability there a lot of what the government has done relative to the scrutiny that they applied around tenders. We think is sort of now reached a kind of a level set or a steady-state in the market. There is we believe a little bit of a lift in spending overall as well. We are in the last year of the 12th fifth year plan. And usually you get a little bit of a bump from a spending standpoint in that regard. And in general, as we said for a long time now, we really believe quite strongly in the structural drivers of that market that there will be continued investment over time in the Chinese market in Life Sciences. And we've seen a number of examples of where the government maintains a consistent outlook that that's an important segment for investment. As our number of other segments that where we are well-positioned like in environmental, like in different segments of healthcare and diagnostics as well as in dental. So we think if we were to choose some segments in China where the government spending is likely to continue to be a focus, we think we've chosen those that are probably best positioned. Brandon Couillard : Super. Thank you. Tom Joyce : Thank you, Brandon. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Matt Gugino for any closing or additional remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks for joining us everyone we are around all day for questions. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Matt, and good morning. This was a busy and exciting quarter for Danaher. Our team executed well using the Danaher business system to deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. In May, we also announced the acquisition of Pall Corporation, the largest in our history, and are intent to separate Danaher into two independent publicly traded companies. Before moving to the details of the quarter, let me provide a quick update on these two big announcements. First on Pall. The transaction's progressing well. We've received U.S. antitrust regulatory approval and anticipate a ruling from the EU next month. We're also making great progress on the planning front, have identified key leadership appointments, and look forward to closing the transaction later this year. On the separation, we have a dedicated team working diligently to execute the transaction. At closing, we will have created two strategically focused, independent companies, each with the ability to pursue meaningful M&A. We believe these companies will be better and stronger separately than they are together and generate substantial long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details on the progress of both of these transactions in the weeks and months ahead. With that, let's move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported another record second quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up approximately 5% to $1.08. Reported revenue grew 3.5% to $5.1 billion while core revenues also increased 3.5%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 6.5% while currency translation was a 6.5% headwind. Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the U.S., Europe, and the high-growth markets. In the high-growth markets, strength in China and the Middle East was offset by weakness in Brazil and Russia. Some of our smaller developed markets, including Japan, experienced more modest growth. Second-quarter gross margin expanded 100 basis points to an all-time high of 53.8%. This increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage allowed us to accelerate our investments in sales and marketing and R&D while still improving core operating margin by 80 basis points. In turn, we believe these investments help drive share gains at Fluke, Hach, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, SCIEX, Nobel Biocare and Videojet, among others. Free cash flow for the quarter was $955 million, up 13% from last year, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 137%. We had a busy quarter on the capital allocation front. We announced not only the Pall deal but also five bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $100 million that strengthen our competitive positions across a number of markets. In the near term, we expect to remain active on the acquisition front with a focus on strengthening our existing businesses via small and mid-sized transactions. Turning now to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 1.5% while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 70 basis points to 19.1%. Our instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth consecutive quarter. Demand was strongest in our calibration and biomedical businesses, each of which grew double digits. During the quarter, we launched our Fluke Connect Asset System to increase the functionality of Fluke Connect, our collection of wireless enabled test tools and analytics software. The Fluke Connect Assets app gives maintenance engineers the power of a complete view of all the equipment in their facilities, including baseline, historical, and current measurement data in one virtual location. This makes predictive and condition-based maintenance even easier for our customers. Since its launch last year, Fluke Connect hardware has exceeded our expectations with almost $50 million in sales and 45,000 software downloads. Tektronix core revenue was up slightly as strong demand from technology customers in China and our distribution channel in Europe was offset by weaker demand in Russia and Latin America. We expect similar core revenue performance in the third quarter. Core revenue in our communications platform decreased at a low-single-digit rate. Demand for our securities solutions and network enterprise business was more than offset by a decline in our network management solutions. Despite the core revenue decline, the platform maintained solid order momentum with a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1. Last week, we closed the previously announced combination of our communications business with NetScout. This is the culmination of a nine-month process in which we brought together two complementary businesses to create one company with extensive global scale and best-in-class solutions to manage and secure the networks of telecom and enterprise customers. As a result of the transaction, our common shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 26 million. Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to thank our associates at Arbor, FNET, and Tek Comms for their hard work during their time at Danaher. I know I speak for our entire leadership team in wishing them well as they join NetScout. Moving now to Environmental, revenue increased 2% with core revenue up 3%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points while reported operating margin was up 150 basis points to 22.5%. Our water quality platform's core revenue grew mid-single digits with growth across our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet treatment businesses. Hach had a good quarter as mid-single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and Europe was augmented by double-digit growth in China. Strength was broad-based with growth across most major product lines. In the quarter, Hach took steps to strengthen its platform of environmental monitoring solutions with the pending acquisition of Sutron Corporation. Sutron provides customized monitoring and control solutions that complement Hach's offering in the Hydromet and oceanographic markets. With this acquisition, Hach will have the industry's only end-to-end suite of remote site equipment and systems that are designed for continuous reliable operation in extreme environments. At ChemTreat, new customer wins and continued traction with new products drove growth in all major geographies. ChemTreat continued to expand its foundation of best-in-class service and sales in Latin America with the acquisition of Lipesa Group, a leading provider of industrial water and process treatment solutions in Columbia, Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru. Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenue was up low single digits. Strength in North America and China was partially offset by a decline in payment solutions in Australia where we had a significant project roll out last year. In the U.S., future EMB compliance requirements drove double-digit growth in point of sales solutions and dispensers. We expect strong demand to continue in this area for the next few years. Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, sales for the quarter were up 3% while core revenue grew 4.5%. Core operating margin increased 55 basis points while reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 15.5% due primarily to a dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our diagnostics platform delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales grew mid-single-digits with growth in most major product lines. Demand in high growth markets remained strong with double-digit growth in China and the Middle East. In Europe, we launched our VERIS molecular diagnostic system along with four viral load assays. The streamlined design of the VERIS system is a breakthrough in workflow simplification and ease of use for our lab customers. Its sample-in, result-out workflow provides test results in only four steps, thus requiring minimal training in a market that's experiencing a shortage of skilled operators. What's more, results are generated over two times faster than traditional molecular diagnostic testing methods. Those of you who attended our analyst day in California last month saw firsthand the tremendous progress we've made at Beckman over the past four years. Using DBS, the Beckman team has worked diligently to reverse the significant quality, delivery, and service shortcomings that existed at acquisition and has vastly improved the customer experience in this process. This effort has helped us exceed our cost savings target and more than double operating profit. Most importantly with these challenges largely behind us, Beckman has redeployed resources that have reinvigorated organic and inorganic growth including the acquisitions of IRIS and MicroScan. We see a number of commonalities between Beckman and Pall, and believe we'll be able to run a similar play book at Pall in the coming years. Turning to Radiometer, Radiometer's core revenue increased high-single-digits with growth in all major product lines and geographies. Demand was particularly healthy at HemoCue where sales grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Since we acquired HemoCue in 2013, we've made significant progress in leveraging Radiometer sales channel to accelerate growth while also expanding operating margins over 1,000 basis points. Leica Biosystem sales increased at a high-single-digit rate with balanced growth across both developed and high growth markets. Advanced Staining grew nearly 20% in the quarter as we continue to improve our relative market position. Devicor, the acquisition we closed in late 2014, posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Our life science platform core revenue increased at a low single digit rate led by double digit in the U.S., particularly offset or partially offset by a decline in Latin America. SCIEX core sales grew mid-single-digits driven by strength in the pharma and clinical end markets. At June's American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting or ASMS, we launched a number of complete workflow solutions including BioBA. BioBA is an integrated offering for biologics analysis that combines the capabilities of our 6500 QTRAP mass spectrometer with the ExionLC high performance liquid chromatography system. The system links ready-to-use sample prep kits with lab automation to simplify the bio pharma research workflow enabling researchers to expand their skill sets and improve their productivity. Leica Microsystems' core revenue decreased low single digits due to weak market conditions in Latin America and in China. Despite the decline, our order growth rate remained positive giving us confidence that Leica will return to growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, Leica closed the acquisition of Bioptigen, strengthening its position in the ophthalmology market. The integration of Bioptigen's advanced optics technology with Leica's surgical microscopes will enable doctors to make better clinical decisions during eye surgery by providing more detailed images of the retina Turning to Dental, core sales were up 1% while total revenues increased 30% largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core operating margins declined 25 basis points with reported operating margin down 60 basis points to 14.2%. Great progress continued at Nobel Biocare as the team delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit average daily sales growth. Profitability has also improved markedly with the operating margins up over 100 basis points in the first half of 2015, excluding restructuring. Growth in dental consumables and treatment units were partially offset by a decline in imaging. While we saw continued destocking in certain areas within our North American distribution channel, we're encouraged by the normalization across many of our product lines in the quarter. We also experienced healthy demand for our instruments in Europe on the back of last quarter's international dental show in Germany. KaVo's updated master series of hand pieces, which provide dental practitioners with exceptional power, low vibration and patented access angles for easier patient treatment, has been particularly well received and contributed to our overall performance. Turning to Industrial Technologies. Revenue increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 165 basis points while reported operating margin increased 180 basis points to 25.6%. Thanks to the team's excellent execution, this was the fourth consecutive quarter that the segment's core margin improved over 110 basis points. Our automation platform's core revenue grew low single digits, led by healthy demand from defense and technology customers in North America and project wins in Europe. Core revenues for product identification increased high single digits. We saw broad-based strength and believe we continue to gain market share across the business. Videojet grew high single digits, led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables. Service revenue, a key focus area for the team, grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth is better across the U.S., Europe and China. ESKO core sales improved high-single-digits, led by healthy demand for both hardware and software. And within software, demand from brand owners was encouraging, with sales up over 30%. X-Rite had a strong quarter in which demand for our color measurement and standards products drove high-single-digit growth. So to wrap it up, we're very pleased with the significant steps we've taken to enhance our portfolio and look forward to an exciting future for Danaher. In the midst of change, our team's outstanding execution using the Danaher business system helped deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. We expect the macro environment to remain a challenge as we move into the second half of 2015, but we're confident that our focus on driving growth and optimizing our portfolio will offer our shareholders substantial value for years to come. We're initiating third-quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1 to $1.04, which assumes core growth comparable to the second quarter of 2015. We're also raising our adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full year 2015 to $4.25 to $4.33 from $4.23 to $4.33. As we described in greater detail in this morning's press release, our recently divested Communications business will be reclassified to discontinued operations, resulting in a $0.03 reduction in adjusted EPS for the first half of 2015. This reduction is largely offset by our outperformance in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding our Communications business in both 2014 and 2015, the midpoint of our full-year 2015 guidance would represent high-single-digit year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Lynette, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take your first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Steve. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I would say this is not that exciting, which is actually pretty good in the context of this environment. Boring is good. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : There's a compliment for you. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's the best I'm going do. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : When \u2013 the Pall deal, you've got some approvals in tow now. Any chance you can close this thing a little bit earlier than expected? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Steve, its Dan. Clearly we're happy with how we're progressing in terms of the various approvals, but again we don't know until we get the last one in. But, there is a decent chance this happens sooner this year. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : But until we get the last one, it's hard to forecast. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And then in the second half of the year, the environment is obviously pretty challenging; 3.5% core growth is good. Any views on getting ahead of further weakness in any restructuring in the second half of the year? I assume the gain you're going to take, that's going to be in disc op, so it's not like that'll be used to offset anything, but what are your views on restructuring in the context of the current environment? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, Steve, we're constantly challenging our teams throughout the course of the year to be looking for opportunities to improve productivity, to position themselves better, to realign cost structures, to align those cost structures to the best growth opportunities. And that's really been going on throughout the course of this year. Obviously as we do assess the macro environment, we'll figure out whether anything more significant needs to be done. But I think at the moment the teams are doing a nice job continuing to look for opportunities as the year progresses. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And is there anything lastly that gets, fundamentally within the businesses, gets materially better or worse in the second half? Anything moving around from an organic perspective? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : I think probably one I'd highlight for you, Steve, there are probably a few others that I wouldn't bring immediately to mind but maybe a headline would be GVR. As we see the EMV regulations continue to come closer, meaning the outdoor regulations that have a deadline in the end of 2017, the indoor regulations that are currently driving some encouraging performance in our POS related technologies, I think those dynamics will continue to improve GVR's performance. GVR was a little lighter here in the second quarter, but I think good year-to-date. But I think we'd look to see that accelerate in the back half of 2015 and clearly into 2016. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks lot. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Just to name one, yeah. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks lot. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yep, thanks, Steve. Operator : We'll hear next from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just want to echo Steve's comments. Boring is good. I think this quarter is going to stack up very well versus the pack. So just wanted to focus a little bit on margin here, because I think that was the real swing from 1Q where you had a little bit of softness on FX and conversion this quarter is much, much better. So I wondered maybe if you could talk about whether the impact of FX moderated or whether that was offset by efficiency metrics. And if I could just then drill into the core Test & Measurement margins, outstanding margins. Looks to be about 24% and change. That's up, you know, about 3 points year-over-year. How sustainable is that and is that driven by mix? Is that restructuring? What's driving that strength? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Nigel, we're clearly continuing to feel the impact of the FX on our margin. Until we anniversary the big move in the euro, that will continue. But overall, very good cost action fall-through. One of the dynamics in Q2, our consumable business aftermarket core growth remained very, very healthy. Our equipment business was slightly softer. I think that's not unlike what we're hearing from a lot of other more equipment-based businesses. So we actually get a favorable mix from that from a margin perspective. But the FX impact is still very much there. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then it looks like the 3Q guide, it looks like you're forecasting on an apples-to-apples basis a pretty significant sequential decline in margins. Looks to be like a 17 handle versus a mid-18s this quarter. Is that the right math? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, clearly there's seasonal here. We're typically down $0.03 or $0.04 on slightly lower revenues Q2 to Q3 and we expect a similar dynamic here. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then finally on the Pall, you pre-funded $2.7 billion euros of debt. The Q mentions CP funding. Any intention to get ahead further on the pre-funding as you get closer to the close? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Well, clearly we've done the $3 billion of the euros. We've set up all the bank facilities to back us up, the commercial paper, and we'll likely do a U.S. bond deal as we get closer to closing. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot, Dan. Operator : Scott Davis from Barclays, your line is open. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Scott. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I don't think you mentioned anything about any updated timing of the breakup or any additional details. Is there any change? I mean, you've had a few months to dial that in a little bit, I guess. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've had a little bit of time here, Scott. But we're still looking at the same timing that we've spoken to earlier. We have a team assembled as I mentioned. Team's gotten to work building action plans. There is a lot to do. I think one of the great things that I've seen recently is how the team is applying principles and the practices of DBS to the whole process. Many of you have seen some of those examples of visual management and project management as you've toured our facilities. We're applying that same approach here. And I think as we do that and time progresses here a bit and we understand some of the details in a deeper way, we'll look for every opportunity to accelerate that. The facts of the matter are that the complexities associated with work to do, associated with the audits that'll need to be done, the filings associated with that. The associated tax-related work will take time, and we're going to do everything we can to accelerate the process. But it's still early days in defining all those details. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Understood. And just getting back I think to Steve's question, if you look at the deeper cyclicals around the world, it almost feels like things are falling apart in front of our eyes. But you guys don't touch oil and gas or commodities in any real way so you don't see it real time. But do you worry that we are on the verge of something that's bigger from a recession perspective and you have to start thinking about getting ahead of it now? Is that something you guys consider, or do you have enough visibility in your book just to say this is generally not going to touch you? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, Scott, I don't know that we have any clearer crystal ball necessarily on the macro environment than a lot of other folks. I think we feel very good about how well our portfolio is positioned to weather storms in various markets. Today I think we're certainly cognizant of the headlines. We've seen the high growth markets become very uneven. While we're still seeing relative strength and excellent execution in places like China and the Middle East, we're very cognizant of the weaknesses in Latin America, specifically in Brazil, the challenges in Russia, and yet I think in many cases, in the overall, we're performing quite well. As we've said in the last couple of calls, our businesses are really well positioned in Europe. We don't see Europe as a particularly robust market at the moment, but we continue to post good growth across a number of our businesses. The U.S. has been steady for us, but again, I think we would look to our own execution as being the underpinnings of that and not so much any great confidence in macro stability going forward. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And, Tom, what's your view on China more explicitly? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we still think China is a very good market for a number of our businesses, Scott. If we look specifically at performances across the portfolio, our Diagnostic business, our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. So we're seeing strength across some of our other businesses as well. Water grew double digits in the quarter. So it's not the same market that it was a year ago or two years ago. It is a more challenging market in a macro context. We've seen some pockets of weakness in areas like academic-related and research funding. But in general, we continue to invest there. We still remain bullish that it will be one of our better growth markets across the whole global landscape. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys, and good luck. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Scott. Operator : We'll move next to Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, all. It looks like the core growth ex-Comms for this past quarter would have been closer to 4% than 3.5%. And if that's right, Tom, can you talk through maybe what it would have been or how should we think about the NewCo versus RemainCo core growth rates? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Good morning, Steve. Your assessment is right that the quarter ex-Comms would have been about 4% rather than the 3.5%. When you look at the portfolio within the context of NewCo and Danaher going forward, the NewCo businesses grew about 3% in the quarter, and the Danaher RemainCo portfolio grew about 4% in the quarter. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And that RemainCo would have been closer to 4.5% then ex-Comms now? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : It would have been a little over 4%, yes. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. And then as you see that growth pacing, you talked a little bit about it, but for Q3 versus Q4, how do you maybe see core growth pacing through those two? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Well, again, we believe as of now, Q3 will be comparable to Q2. We have a few less selling days in Q4 which benefited Q1, but adjusted for that, we're not looking for a fundamental change and despite arguably a tougher, incrementally tougher macro environment, we're looking for core growth to stay relatively steady with where we are today. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. Steady ex-Comms, right? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, maybe just a comment on Dental would be helpful. You talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, but are you seeing a fundamental improvement then in the business and how should we think about that business progressing going forward? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Steve, we are seeing some improvement in our performance in dental. The Q2 growth that I mentioned of 1% was better than where we were in Q1. We're not yet where we want to be, but we saw some improvement in a number of areas. We're particularly enthusiastic about the great start that we've had with Nobel. It's not in the core numbers but having a very good start with mid-single-digit core growth for the second quarter and the second quarter in a row. We look at sellout and sellout remains very good. It's in probably the 3% to 4% range. Again, it will vary a bit across product categories, but I think sellout continues to be good. I think as we look at consumables and equipment, generally a number of areas performing better than they were. Still some work to do, but we think we're approaching the tail-end of some inventory related destocking activities that impacted primarily the equipment side, and were more or less isolated to the North American market. So I think quite a number of things to be encouraged about and clearly still some work to do in some spots. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners, your line is open. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Jeff. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple of quick ones. First, just China overall, can you say if you bid \u2013 I missed it \u2013 what the China growth rate was in the quarter overall? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Jeff, we were about 8%, 9% which has been remarkably consistent. We were just talking about it with the China team the last five or six quarters. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah, that is solid. And then on water treatment, Dan or Tom, what's actually driving the activity there? Can you provide a little granularity on muni versus industrial or geographic and how you think that trends in the back half of the year? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Absolutely, Jeff. Let's start with the Hach business. The Hach business continues to perform very well. Another very good quarter. I just mentioned their growth in China at double digits on the quarter, but continued good performance in the developed markets, specifically obviously in the U.S. and in Europe. And in general, that would span across industrial and muni. So I think we're seeing \u2013 we've seen pretty good progress there. They continue to invest in growth both on the sales and marketing side as well as in R&D. And I think we're seeing the benefits of consistent year-over-year investment net business and very, very good execution. If you look at Trojan, Trojan more on the equipment side, keep in mind that Hach is a little bit more of an OpEx related business, a little bit less CapEx exposure. Trojan a little bit more CapEx exposure. Had a good quarter, second consecutive positive core growth quarter. We're starting to see some improvement in bid volume on a global basis, and this is a lumpy business given the project nature, more CapEx oriented. But generally we're feeling pretty good about where Trojan is. We talked a number of times about the investments that we've made in ballast water. We noted that we filed formally for U.S. type approval via the coast guard. We're waiting for any questions or follow-up on that filing. But we remain encouraged about the potential for growth there. And then finally at ChemTreat, another good quarter at ChemTreat, performing very well. Probably faces a few more challenging pockets in the macro environment. There actually is a little bit of oil and gas exposure in that business. We've had some success up in the oil sands in Canada, and so we've seen some softness there. The steel market has been a little bit more challenging. So while ChemTreat continues to grow very positively and gain share, there's a few pockets of softness there that we'll need to offset. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Just one more quick one. Thank you, Tom, for all that. It sounds like the smaller bolt-ons might be ramping up. Did any of those happen in what's going to be the NewCo in the quarter and do you anticipate bolt-ons in the NewCo as you work through this process? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Jeff, we definitely do. And we're spending a lot more time with Jim and his team ramping up that effort. And I would expect to see some bolt-ons here in NewCo in the next 12 months, 18 months Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : We'll hear next from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Can you talk a little bit about the variation in the core margin improvement across the segments? You had a couple real strong runs, right, with Environmental and Industrial, and then LS&D up a little less on core and then Dental down. I know you're doing some investments and some restructuring there. Maybe just give us a feel for what you're doing there and what kind of benefit we might see coming out of it. Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. It's Dan, Shannon. On Life Science Diagnostics, that is a segment that we get probably hit the hardest from an FX perspective, but on a constant-currency basis, they would have been up 100 basis points. So kind of feel underlying from a core perspective, we're making the progress we should be making but just paying a lot of FX pain right now. Good core growth numbers. We are investing, high growth markets, new products, so I think you're seeing some of the impact there. But you're seeing it on the core growth side. Dental is a function of very modest core growth, growing 1%, tougher to expand those margins. We'll need a little better core growth to see core margin expansion here in the second half. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then how do you guys feel about the overall healthcare market? I mean, you said I think Life Sciences was up double digits in the U.S., which seemed remarkably strong. I know you guys in a lot of your businesses have new products driving a lot of growth. I mean, is that Life Sciences' number a function of just overall market or just how do you feel about the market? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Shannon, we think about the market first of all in, probably to keep it simple, two different dimensions. We think about it in terms of truly more of a healthcare-oriented market, the term you used, that would impact our Diagnostic businesses more. And then more of a Life Science market that is more skewed towards selling to life science related academic and research institutions, universities, pharma, big pharma, food testing, et cetera. So first and foremost, we sort of separate it into those two segments of the market. Specific to your question about our Life Science platform in North America, we had some businesses that executed extremely well. Leica Microsystems, for example, despite the modest performance overall during the quarter due to some high growth market challenges had a very strong quarter in the U.S. SCIEX had an excellent quarter in the U.S. and that's really just good commercial execution. I wouldn't say it's a function of the macro environment. Back on the healthcare side, we've seen utilization in hospitals increase very modestly. Generally hospitals are in better shape financially today, so we've seen some investment coming through. And so I think that's certainly a little bit of a help, but, again, I would point to our execution, improvements in Beckman's overall performance, certainly Radiometer, a consistent performer, Leica Biosystems growing 20% in advanced staining and growing in some of the core histo applications also underpinning that. And those would all be growth rates that would be higher than the underlying market and certainly higher than the increases in utilization. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Shannon. Operator : Up next is Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ross. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : So I thought I'd start just, you were talking a bit about Life Sciences, digging in just a little more in the biopharma side. It's obviously going to get more important when you close Pall, but it seems like a very kind of healthy sub-segment. We've seen it across the board. Maybe a little color of what you saw in SCIEX in that segment. And I know you obviously haven't closed Pall yet, but filtration numbers across the board have been consistently spectacular this quarter, and so as you're thinking about where you touch today, particularly on the biotech side, but where you will be going forward, how do you feel about that end market specifically? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Ross, we feel very good about that end market as we, I think, pointed out in a number of our conversations about the Pall transaction. We see the biopharma market to be one of the most attractive markets from a sustainable growth perspective in the years to come. You saw that in Pall's reported numbers coming out of their last quarter. So we feel very good about the growth prospects there. Specific to our business, I would probably point to SCIEX specifically as a business that performed very well. Their approach to that market is broad-based in terms of the full range of pharma customers, and we continue to see good growth. They were one of our best performers in the life science platform and, specifically, a very strong performer in North America. So we remain very bullish on that market. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe, Dan, just building off of the prior question on sort of tuck-in activity at NewCo, one of the things I've heard from folks is a concern about valuations across that complex and a lack of targets that fit the old Danaher model. I guess as you look at the pipeline there and the types of businesses or the size of businesses and public versus private, do you see a pretty good plethora of opportunities and do you feel like it's difficult given valuations there to do deals, or do you feel like there's pockets where you still could see some pretty good high return type acquisitions? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Well, I don't think we would have announced a separation if we didn't see a significant opportunity there. And just in the last 45 days, we really kind of geared up again the M&A activity for many of what will be Jim's businesses. We're already starting to see some bolt-ons that I think will come through in the next six months, but I think there are also larger opportunities in time. And that is a team at Fluke, Gilbarco that have executed extremely well on their bolt-on adjacent-type acquisitions, and we feel very good about that opportunity going forward. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, guys. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse, please go ahead. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Just had a question around in Industrial on the product ID side. It looks like you're still outgrowing the market maybe 2x or so. Maybe just give some color as to what's driving that. Is there some disruption at Domino because of the merger? Is it a product suite issue or do you think it's more fundamental around the software expertise? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks, Julian, and good morning. Product ID, specifically Videojet, I'll start with Videojet, has performed very well. I would say that it is largely a function of very strong DBS-oriented execution at VJ. Some of the growth-oriented tools of DBS that we've spoken about in the past, tools around funnel management and transformative marketing, have really been developed and brought to maturity at Videojet. And we've seen the impact of the utilization of those tools in their commercial execution and the resulting growth performance and share gains. So it's a great job by that team, and I think we'll continue to see good performance there. That performance is replicated or is very similar when we look at Esko and X-Rite, two terrific acquisitions that the platform has done, really broadening its footprint and bringing a broader suite of solutions to brand owners. And so I think all is tracking in the right direction in terms of the platform. Relative to Domino, we have not seen any particular impact of that. The PID business in general and VJ specifically is performing exceptionally well in Europe. And so I think we're in good shape. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then just to follow up on Dental, it sounded like the sellout has been pretty good, which I guess would mean the inventories have sort of run their course. But Dan sounded fairly certain with respect about the scope for the margin expansion in dental in the second half. So I just wanted to understand, do you think Q3 and Q4 will see an acceleration in Dental? Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We will. I think it'll still be relatively modest but it will be better than what we've seen here in the first half. We were encouraged by consumables returning to a more normal growth level, more typical margin performance. And while equipment was a tad better, and the sellout numbers are fine, I'm not sure we're entirely done from a destock perspective. I think we've got the biggest pieces behind us but I still think there'll be a little bit more here in the second half. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then lastly just very quickly, the SG&A costs in Q1 I think had caused a bit of consternation around their increase, more normal in Q2. Given the SG&A to sales should continue to sort of \u2013 the increases should level off there in the second half. Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I mean, on a sequential basis, clearly part of that's Nobel which comes in with a direct selling model, so it's a pretty more heftier selling expense, but you should see some continued normalization. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Moving next to Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. I just want to stay on the Dental theme for a minute here. The destocking dynamic, that's the second quarter in a row, and I think, if I understood Dan's comments there previously, sounds like there might be a little more to go. I'm just curious why that is. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think these are the types of things that obviously take some time. They're worked, Isaac, in collaboration with our distribution partners. You've got some balancing going on between different product lines, and so it's really just an evolutionary process. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And so if we were to try and look at the year holistically, the first half's been pretty flat. The last few years you've been closer to 3% or so. Is it unrealistic to think, given the destocking dynamics that 3% is possible this year for the full year? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : I think it might be a stretch for the full year, but I think in the second half, we'd be looking to try to achieve that kind of number. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Appreciate it guys. Thank you. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Isaac. Operator : And your final question today will come from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Considering all the transactions you have going on, you still were able to complete five bolt-ons. Maybe a comment on what that pipeline looks like and capacity both capital and management eyeballs to get more deals done. Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Deane, we're pretty happy. We did see the pace of bolt-ons ramp up last year. That's continued here in the first half. On the margin, some of the incremental choppiness in the macro environment is helping get some of these bolt-ons to the finish line. Now that we're geared up here with Jim and many of his businesses, I expect that pace to continue. We're not going to do any multibillion dollar deals here in the next 12 months, but I think you should see a very healthy continued pace of bolt-ons across the platform. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then just the last question, if you could put the spotlight on the Sutron deal for a moment and hydrological monitoring. It's interesting that's part of environmental, but it's Hach environmental. What are the linkages with Sutron and water quality both from a technology standpoint but also go to market? Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Deane, we have a suite of products in our Hach portfolio, Hach Lange portfolio, that we refer to as Hach environmental. And we use that term to reference the fact that that suite of products, those instruments and software and various communications modalities, allow us to provide capabilities outside of municipal and industrial water, namely in rivers, lakes, streams, tributaries, and all the way out into the blue ocean \u2013 the deep ocean areas with businesses like Sea-Bird. What Sutron provides us is a bolt-on acquisition that adds capabilities in satellite communications, in remote data transfer that add significant potential to instruments that are already installed in those applications. And so it's a tremendous add. It's a business that we've known for a long time. We've had an excellent relationship over many years with the leaders of that business, and we're thrilled to have them join the portfolio. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Deane. Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Deane. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Gugino, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're around all day for questions. Operator : And that does conclude today's teleconference.

Today, we reported another record third quarter for Danaher. We are pleased with our team's execution which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow. In a weakening global macro environment, we saw the positive impact of the Danaher Business System across our portfolio. Our consistent pace of new product introductions and go-to-market initiatives led to mid single digit growth or better for several of our operating companies, including Hach, Trojan, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, Videojet and Matco. We're also making steady progress on the separation front. This quarter we announced many key leadership positions for both NewCo and Danaher and began to identify new growth opportunities for many of our associates. With strong teams in place at both companies we remain on track to complete the separation in 2016. So with that as a backdrop, let's move on to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up 6% to $1.05. Reported revenue grew 6.5% to $5 billion, while core revenues increased 3%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 10.5% while currency translation was a 7% headwind. Geographically, growth rates were balanced between the developed and the high-growth markets. Within the developed markets, the U.S. remained steady, growing at a low single digit rate, while Western Europe increased mid single digits as a result of share gains in a number of our businesses. In the high-growth markets, demand was mixed with strength in India partially offset by weakness in Brazil, Russia, and the Middle East. In China, growth moderated slightly from first half levels but still grew mid single digits in the quarter. Third quarter gross margin was 52.5%. It increased 40 basis points, or 80 basis points excluding acquisition-related adjustments from Pall. Core operating margin declined 10 basis points and reported operating margin was 15.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, core operating margin expanded 50 basis points. Free cash flow for the quarter was $691 million, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 115%. We expect this solid performance to continue in the fourth quarter. We're also having a record year on the M&A front. In addition to Pall, we closed or announced nine acquisitions for approximately $650 million in the first nine months of 2015, bringing our total spend to over $14 billion. Our funnels at both Danaher and NewCo are strong and we expect to focus our activity on small and mid-sized transactions throughout the separation process. In August, we closed the acquisition of Pall ahead of schedule, thanks to diligent work from both our teams. We're excited to welcome this iconic brand to Danaher and we're already impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment we're seeing as Pall associates begin to embrace the DBS process. Ultimately, we expect the thoughtful application of DBS tools and principles to result not only in an improved growth trajectory but in a better experience for our customers. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $300 million of cost synergies we previously outlined and have financed the acquisition in an interest rate environment that is very favorable for highly rated companies. So now turning to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 2% while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.7%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew low single digits as strength in our Biomedical and Calibration product lines was offset by weakening industrial demand in China and North America. Tektronix revenue declined low single digits as solid demand in North America and Western Europe, particularly for our high-performance oscilloscopes, was offset by weakness in Latin America and Russia. Tektronix innovations continued to lead the market as we introduced several new products this quarter. Notably, we began shipping our new high-performance oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX, this quarter. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal-capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce signal noise and distortion so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems. Moving to Environmental, revenue increased 1% with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin was up 160 basis points to 22%. Our Water Quality platforms core revenue increased mid single digits with Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan all growing mid single digits or better. Across the platform, the Danaher Business System is helping our R&D, sales and support teams bring new products to market faster, convert leads to new business, and drive customer loyalty. At Hach, this drove broad-based growth across all major product lines and geographies, including China and Latin America. As water becomes an increasingly valuable resource, our customers are more focused than ever on analyzing their local water supplies with the greatest degree of accuracy and simplicity. Hach's new products, including the SL1000 PPA that we introduced last year, enable customers to perform critical tests and analyze data more easily than ever before. ChemTreat also grew across all of its major geographies, in spite of the challenging environment, revenue in Latin America grew double digits, thanks to the team's outstanding execution and quick adoption of DBS in our recent acquisitions Aguasin and Lipesa. Trojan also had a solid quarter driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market. Turning to Gilbarco Veeder-Root, GVR had a strong quarter, delivering high single digit revenue growth as robust demand in North America was partially offset by a decline in China. In the U.S., double digit sales in order growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers continued as retailers began to implement new and upgraded EMV-compliant systems. We expect EMV regulations to drive demand at GVR for the next several years. Now turning to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, sales were up 14.5% while core revenue grew 3.5%. Operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 10.8%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Margins were also negatively impacted by continued weakness in emerging market currencies and cost actions taken during the quarter. In addition, we continue to invest in feet on the street and new product initiatives to accelerate future growth. Our Diagnostic platform delivered low single digit core revenue growth. Specifically at Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew low single digits driven by our immunoassay and urinalysis products. During the quarter, we launched the DxH 500, a low volume hematology analyzer designed for use in physician office labs. The DxH 500 offers fast, powerful data processing software and longer up time, saving our customers time and money and helping keep their focus on patient care. At Radiometer, healthy demand in both high-growth and developed markets contributed to high single digit revenue growth. This marks Radiometer's 15th consecutive quarter of high single digit growth or better. All major product lines grew mid single digits or better, led by AQT, which was up more than 20%. Leica Biosystems increased at a low single digit rate as strength in Western Europe was partially offset by a double digit decline in the Middle East. Demand remained healthy for both advanced staining consumables and our recently acquired Devicor business. This August, we celebrated Leica's 10-year anniversary as part of the Danaher portfolio. Over the past decade, Leica Biosystems has built a leading pathology diagnostics platform through a series of strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. Leica Biosystems now generates over $800 million in annual sales and has nearly eight times the operating profit it had in 2005. Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a mid single digit rate. High single digit growth in the U.S. and double digit growth in Europe were offset by weakness in the high growth markets. SCIEX core sales grew mid single digits, driven by continued strength in our pharma and clinical end markets. During the quarter, we enhanced our QTRAP and Triple Quad mass spectrometry systems with the addition of the 6500+ series, offering revolutionary sensitivity, wider sample coverage and faster switching speeds, the 6500+ helped researchers detect more compounds to better understand disease, protect our water and food supplies, and develop pharmaceutical therapies. Customer reception has been very positive and sales since launch have exceeded our expectations. Leica Microsystems core revenue increased slightly, as growth in the U.S. and Eastern Europe was largely offset by weakness in Western Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Orders were stronger, up mid single digits, with robust demand for our medical and life science products. We recently launched the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] digital microscope for use in quality assurance, research and development, and forensics applications. With a combination of outstanding optics, intuitive operation and smart software, the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] enables users to change objectives with one hand and process results with the other, all while automatically keeping samples in focus. In addition, it's offered in three configurations which help our customers find a solution that best fits their applications, workflows and budget needs. Moving on to Dental. Total revenues increased 23.5%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition, while core revenue decreased slightly. As a result of this decrease, we saw a 55 basis point lower core operating margin while reported operating margin also declined 240 basis points to 14.8%. Nobel Biocare is approaching its first anniversary at Danaher and delivered another quarter of solid results. Since acquisition, Nobel has delivered mid single digit average daily sales growth and over 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. NobelClinician, our implant workflow management software, has helped drive this success, and during the quarter, we celebrated our 10,000th Clinician [NobelClinician] customer. Within the rest of the Dental segment, growth in consumables was offset by a decline in our North American and Middle Eastern equipment businesses. During the quarter, Kerr launched the SonicFill 2 in Europe, building upon the success of the original SonicFill by providing dental practitioners with more options for color matching and filling strength. Since its launch in North America earlier this year, the SonicFill product family has grown double digits. It remains the only single-step, sonic-activated handpiece that allows clinicians to easily fill cavities in posterior teeth. Turning to Industrial Technologies, sales decreased 6.5% while core revenue was flat. Core operating margin expanded 20 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 10 basis points to 24.4%. Our automation platform's core revenue declined low single digits with weakness in North America and China. In North America, we experienced weaker demand from our distribution partners and have seen a contraction in capital spending. Product identification core revenues increased low single digits. We saw particularly strong demand for our marking and coding products. which grew mid single digits in Europe, and we believe we continue to take share in that region. Videojet grew mid single digits with growth across all major product lines. Driving innovation in the market is a key focus area for Videojet and year-to-date, the team has launched several new products that help increase efficiency, improve quality and ensure reliability for our customers. During the quarter, Videojet expanded its thermal inkjet offerings with the launch of the m600 oem. The m600 was designed specifically for packaging machine builders in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food end markets, and offers a 60% smaller footprint, reduced heat emissions, and expanded control options for critical coding applications. So, in summary, we had another good quarter, delivering solid core growth, free cash flow and earnings performance. In a challenging global macro environment, we've continued to enhance our businesses through organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. As we move forward, we believe the strength of our portfolio combined with our team's steadfast execution through the Danaher Business System will help us deliver strong operating results and shareholder value for the remainder of 2015 and beyond. Wrapping up, for the fourth quarter, we anticipate approximately 2% core revenue growth, which will be impacted by four fewer selling days versus last year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.29, which implies year-on-year growth of 12% to 15%. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Eric, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take the first question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning, guys. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Nigel. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to pick up on some of the guidance, Tom. It seems that September was weaker than the rest of the quarter, just maybe comment on that. And the 2% core growth as we enter 4Q shouldn't be a surprise, given the selling days pressure, but given the weaker September, is there a risk it could be a bit weaker than 2%? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nigel, good morning. Overall, we have seen some incremental slowing in the macro. That being said, it's in pockets. There's some pockets regionally where we've seen some of that slowing, clearly, and in some of the more industrially oriented markets. We saw that in September. But I would not say we've seen some form of a step change in demand across the portfolio. In fact, we think generally, the portfolio is very well positioned, it clearly differentiates us. And generally we think, when you look at the strength of the portfolio, when you look at the fact that we got the Pall closing done and we're getting after the opportunities that we have there, and we see the year-over-year FX impacts potentially dissipating as we move forward, clearly some weakening, but my inclination is continue to play offense. We need to continue to be cognizant of both the headlines and our trend lines, but our bias is to build on our strengths and despite some slowing here, we think the fourth quarter could largely be consistent on a days adjusted basis, anyway, with what we've seen here in the late going in September. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's great. And then just as a follow-on, we're seeing some of your competitors have stepped up restructuring as we enter 2016. Are we still on plan with the original guidance for restructuring or do you see the potential for maybe an uptick in 4Q? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Back in December, we laid out sort of the view of the year, and I think what's a little bit different this year is that \u2013 and in line with that guidance, by the way, we've done some things along the way. We haven't simply sat back and taken stock of things here in the fourth quarter, but instead, I think we've been better at having each of our businesses look for opportunities along the way. So we've seen some activity going on throughout each of the quarters of the year. And while as we go through the fourth quarter, we may do a little bit more than we initially anticipated. Those plans are sort of still in the works here. But we think overall, that plan will be pretty consistent, maybe a little bit higher. Obviously, there'll be some Pall contributions to that activity. But generally, we think that will set us up pretty well for 2016. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, Tom, that's great. Thanks a lot. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nigel, appreciate the questions. Operator : And the next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Could we get a little more color on Pall and, in particular, what you're seeing in the Industrial businesses there as well as the Life Sciences? And then just also what are the kind of financial moving parts as far as profit contribution in the fourth quarter and then to the extent that you're either investing that away with restructuring or letting that drop to the bottom line? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, thanks, Steve. First of all, we're really pleased that we got the Pall closing done as we did. Terrific teamwork, I think, on the part of the Pall team as well as the Danaher team to get that done sooner than anticipated. We're off to a very good start. We have Rainer Blair, who many of you know from our Life Science business, in the leadership position over the business right now. We've added Danaher teammates to the Pall squad and teams are working well, driving both growth initiatives as well as cost initiatives. Specific to your question, Steve, on Industrial and Life Science. On Life Science, we've seen continued strength, anchored specifically in the biopharma side of the Life Science portfolio, consistent with what we've seen historically in the business and consistent with our expectations. We have seen an incremental level of weakness in the Industrial side of the house. Again, probably to be expected, given the nature of the exposure to certain end markets in Industrial business. So incremental weakening, but understandably so, given those vertical markets. Specific to the financial contributions, we will see some contribution clearly here in the fourth quarter at Pall, but obviously that will, in fact, be offset to some extent by any of the cost actions that we'll take and the investments that we'll make. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So you're investing that away. And what was the core for Industrial in the quarter? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : They were all up. Pall with mid single digits, with Life Science high single to double, and Industrial slightly negative. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then one last question. How was September for you guys? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : September was up about 2%, Steve. We thought it would closer to 3% and that kind of cost us 0.5 point overall in the quarter. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. All right, thanks a lot. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Operator : The next question is from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Scott. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Tom, can you give us a little bit more color on Dental? And when you think about like \u2013 I can't do the math because I don't have the data, but if Nobel Biocare was up so well then the core underlying business must have been down pretty meaningfully. And you said consumables were strong, so basically means that dentists have stopped buying equipment. So I don't know this business well enough to know whether you get some strange buying patterns there or not, but can you give us a little bit of color on what are your sales guys telling you? Why are dentists not buying right now? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Scott, one point of clarification, in our core number, we are not including Nobel yet. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Oh, okay. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So on an adjusted basis, we would have been up low single digits, but I'll still let Tom \u2013 the question on why we were down slightly. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, Dan. Your question still has merit, Scott. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That makes me feel better. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, but let's go a little deeper outside. First of all, on Nobel, just a quickie. We're really happy with what's going on there. The team has done an excellent job. Average daily sales rates continuing to trend very well. New product introductions coming out on schedule with a strong cadence, great acceptance in the marketplace. Good progress across various regions. So all in, we're super happy with the start there and team's doing well. But onto the core of your question, probably important to think about it in terms of the consumables side of the house versus the equipment side of the house. We saw better performance on the consumables side of the house. We've made a lot of progress, which we had talked about throughout the course of this year, on rightsizing inventories in the channel, driving some sell-out, and our performance there is really pretty good from the standpoint of what we're seeing in the sell-out data. I'd contrast that a little bit to what we've seen on the equipment side. Where on the equipment side it's the inventory rightsizing in the channel that's taken us a little bit longer than we had anticipated. So that is a bit of a headwind there. And secondly, we did see some slowdown in equipment purchases, particularly in the high growth markets, where it's a little bit more project-oriented. Now, the key thing that we look at, though, when we look through those numbers is we look at the sell-out numbers. And the sell-out numbers are \u2013 on a year-to-date basis, were in line with the market, certainly, so we think we're holding our own from a share perspective. But it's taken us a little bit longer to get where we wanted to on the equipment channel side and, again, a little high-growth market headwind. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then, I had an interesting meeting with a financial sponsor yesterday who just commented that they thought the IPO option was dissipating pretty fast and that they wanted to derisk their portfolio pretty quickly, and this was a fairly large sponsor. It seems to be an environment where Danaher could really provide some liquidity and pick up some decent assets at good prices, but you did comment that you were looking at more small and middish stuff. Is there a scenario where you would stretch the balance sheet and/or even tap equity markets if you felt like it was the right transaction, just given the dynamics out there? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think your question's framed in the right way, Scott. For the right strategic transaction, for the transaction, for the asset, the business that really strengthens us strategically that adds a level of competitive advantage, that provides a greater level of growth rate on a long-term basis, we would do the right thing from the standpoint of whether that's going into the markets, as we did so effectively to finance the Pall transaction, or set up the balance sheet in a way that would allow us to do that. So my comments should not mean to suggest that there's a bright line that's snapped at a certain point beyond which we wouldn't go. So it's all about the strategic value that can be created. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair enough. Good answer. Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Scott. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Steve, good morning. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Hey, just first on the separation timing, I know you've obviously been very busy, you got Pall done early, what are the key hurdles to having that separation happen earlier? Is there a desire to do that earlier anyway? How are you thinking about that at this point? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Steve, two of the bigger drivers are filing with the IRS and getting a favorable ruling on key points and then, two, filing the Form 10 with the SEC and getting through that process. We're working diligently. I think there is a good chance, prior to the investor meeting, we'll have a better sense on whether or not we'll be able to try to pull this thing forward from our end of the year kind of current timeline. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then secondly, just perhaps a minor point, but maybe help us understand to what extent in all the major currency headwinds that you've called out, how much of the margin impact is really transactional in terms of maybe mismatched price and cost base? Help us maybe just understand how you're thinking about that in the quarter. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I mean try to think through kind of a high-level example. So if you take \u2013 we've got $5 billion of revenues and 25% of that's in the high-growth markets, not all of that's in local currency, but most of it \u2013 call it $1 billion of it in local currency, that's just kind of a rough number. Through the course of Q3, if you look at the JPMorgan Index, which is they track the top 10 emerging market currencies, those depreciated 10% during the quarter, from the beginning of July to the end of September. So call that a weighted average of a 5% decline. So you have a 5% decline on $1 billion of revenues, that's $50 million of revenues that we lost that we didn't think we'd lose at the beginning of the quarter. The dynamic on the margin side is in those high-growth markets, it's primarily sales and service and marketing people. So the lower local currency maybe saved us $10 million, $15 million of SG&A expense, but very little cost of goods expense. So you lost $50 million of revenues and you probably lost $15 million, $20 million of lower operating expense from currency, so you get a transaction effect of losing $20 million, $30 million of operating profit. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, fantastic, very helpful. Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thank you. Just a question on some of the other companies in the group, they sort of break out price, raw materials price, raw materials impact on margins year-to-date, and obviously it's been a decent tailwind I think for pretty much every company. Is there any color you could provide in the nine-month period, let's say, not just the quarter on how much of a benefit price raw material has been? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Julian, it's clearly been a slight benefit. We continue to get about 60 basis points, 70 basis points of price largely in our consumables business. But commodities \u2013 given our gross margin profile, commodities do not play a big impact on our cost of goods sold. The one area where I would have thought we would have actually gotten more of a benefit than we have is actually on the logistics side. Clearly, fuel prices have come down, but the transport companies have been pretty sticky about reducing prices. Now, again, I think as demand gets a little weaker here, maybe that helps. So it's been a benefit to date. But just given our product make-up, it's not been \u2013 the commodity side doesn't help or hurt us as much as most industrial companies. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you, and then just a question on China. Obviously, the last month or two, people are trying to see if there's any evidence of a bottoming-out in short-term demand there. Maybe just talk about how you have seen demand in the different verticals in the last three months or four months. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Julian, we've actually seen China, while slowing incrementally, it's still one of the better markets where we play today. Our growth rates continue to be very good in a number of our businesses. Specifically in our Diagnostic business, we continue to grow extremely well in China. We've seen some of the \u2013 some of the slowing that we had talked about around tenders for Life Science over a period of time, that money has freed up. Not perhaps to the same rate that we would have hoped by this point, but certainly, we're seeing a better environment for life science spending. Our Environmental businesses continue to see terrific opportunities. And so I think as we look at China, we really continue to look at a number of sectors in that market where our businesses are extremely well positioned and where the sectors themselves are really quite attractive. So, clearly, the more industrially oriented you are, the more challenging that may be, but our Environmental businesses, our Life Science Diagnostic businesses are well positioned and we still feel very good about those. I think that's probably a market, as an example, where we really plan to and my bias is to continue to play offense. We'll be selective about where those investments go and target them to the higher growth segments, but in general, we're still constructive in that market. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi, good morning, guys. So maybe a little bit more color on the pharma vertical as a whole would be helpful. I know you talked to Pall in the quarter obviously. There's been a number of sort of volatile events in the space, on drug pricing, et cetera and we've obviously seen a bit of a collapse in some biotech prices. And so help us understand, I mean, it seems like SCIEX had a pretty good quarter and obviously the biotech side of Pall did as well. So help us think through the market volatility and whether or not that sort of worries you at all relative to the demand side of things. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Ross. We continue to be bullish on those markets. Yes, obviously there's been some volatility, certainly, in those markets, certainly in terms of the way they've been trading. And of course, our exposure, as you mentioned, is largely in the Pall business as well as across our Life Science platform, and more specifically around AB SCIEX. Specifically, our pharma exposure in Life Sciences is about probably 20% or 25% of that business specifically goes into that market. In the case of Pall, specifically it's about a third of their business is bio pharma-related. The growth rates there continued to be very strong throughout the course of the quarter. These are critical applications that to some extent are a bit insulated from the core volume side of what's going on inside of those facilities. In other words, whether you're making a large volume or a small volume, you're still going to be running that equipment and consuming some of our products. On the research side, the research investments, while they're shifting around a bit, continue to be relatively good. So I think in general, we're staying the course there and we think there's still great opportunities ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe just dovetailing off of Steve's question from earlier, it's been an environment that's been difficult for you from an M&A standpoint last few years, but we're finally getting to a period where there's a little more volatility, if valuation has come down in some subsectors, seems like the timing may be fortuitous given when you can complete the spin next year. Maybe remind us around your activity level on tuck-ins during the last kind of market dislocation in 2008-2009 and talk a little about the trade-off of kind of completing the spin in due course versus the desire to sort of continue to add on at least more of the tuck-ins versus maybe anything larger. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I hope we're not looking at 2008-2009. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : No, obviously. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : During \u2013 obviously, that was a good period for us in that 2008-2009 period, we acquired almost \u2013 brought in almost 20 companies and not surprisingly, those are among our best returns for the company. I don't think we're heading into that, but the environment's getting tougher. We talked earlier about the IPO market being tough here and I think that bodes well, I think that bodes quite well for NewCo, given the choppiness in the industrial sector, given a little less competition from private equity. We've talked about roughly 2 billion of capacity the rest of this year and into next year. But as we get towards the end of \u2013 middle, end of next year, that number's going to jump back up a lot. So we're not \u2013 Tom suggested we're not shutting down, we're still working hard looking at activities, looking at possibilities both for Danaher and at NewCo. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ross. Operator : We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Had a couple quick comments or questions on the Water Quality side of the business and maybe you can give a frame for us how you're seeing municipal budgets today. Everything I'm reading, it looks as though muni budgets are actually one of the growth markets at least for North America. So how are muni budgets favoring projects for Trojan, for example? And then a second question on Pall, it's interesting that Pall, as you expect, you see the logo in the Life Sciences side, but it could have easily also showed up today in the Environmental logos, and be interested in how you're positioning Pall in go-to-market in Water Quality. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Deane. So specific to municipal budgets and the overall municipal water market as a growth market, it's interesting, right, because we could talk about it as a growth market today, everything's relative. We haven't historically thought of the North American muni market as a growth market on a relative basis, but today, it really probably is. To your point, it's growing better than a lot of other markets that are much more challenged. And I think the way I would describe it, Deane, is that in contrast to probably the last three years or four years where those budgets were flat or down, largely recovering from a pretty challenging housing market in so many areas around the U.S, today, we'd say those budgets are probably growing modestly. A lot of muni budgets are probably growing maybe in the 2% or 3% range, and that's 2% or 3% better or more than what they were growing probably in the last three years or four years. So there are good opportunities there. They continue to contribute well to \u2013 certainly to Hach Lange as well as to Trojan. Specific to your question about Trojan, we have seen the bidding activity up this year and we've seen overall revenue converting that business \u2013 that bidding activity into revenue up this year as well. So probably one of the better markets where we participate today and clearly with leading positions, we believe we're gaining share in Water Quality. In the Pall business, Pall does have a position in municipal water. It is \u2013 it's not one of their larger businesses, but we believe there are opportunities there. And we have a team at Trojan as well as at Pall looking together at where there might be cooperative opportunities. It could be on certain projects or certain opportunities relative to technology where bringing filtration as well as ultraviolet treatment together may be a great opportunity for a customer. So it's early days there. We're really just getting into the 100-day strategic plans across those vertical markets, but it is a good position to start with and we'll see what we can do. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, and just a quick question. What was NewCo's core revenues in the quarter? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Deane, they were a little bit under the 3%. So they were 2%, 2.5% led by both Gilbarco and Matco. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Deane. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys, good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question on free cash conversion. what are the buckets for improvement in the fourth quarter? And also if you could give us an initial sense given that we've closed Pall, how much working capital contribution can we get in 2016? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Andrew, I don't know if we're looking at a very different dynamic in Q4 of this year versus last year. We did see a spike in payables at the end of the third quarter. That sometimes happens when we have a quarter end that's in the following month. So we actually closed a quarter in October as opposed to September 29, September 30. That should normalize back in the quarter. We tend to have pretty good working capital performance as we get towards the end of the year. That should be another contributor. So I don't think \u2013 I don't see a very different frame than what we had last year. We're still working through the Pall numbers. We think there's some meaningful cash flow opportunities there, not only in the working capital side but also on the CapEx \u2013 managing CapEx a little differently there, but we'll talk about both of those more in time. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just a follow-up on separation timing. Did you change your disclosure language on the timing? Because the QNO (45:28) says in 2016, or is it the same language as before? Just to confirm, sorry. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't remember. What I'm continuing to say is our expectation is 2016, we still believe it will be the end of the year but that could change, and if there is a change, it would be to the positive and we'll know more here in a couple months. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : And the next question's from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys, thank you. Just a question on Beckman to start. If I just take a quick look at peers here like Abbott and Roche, some of them do seem to have core growth rates closer to the high single digit range. And so I'm curious, sort of, if I look back at my notes, you guys had an analyst meeting earlier this year and gave a lot of disclosure on the things you've done to turn around the franchise, but curious kind of what you need to do from here to kind of pace ahead of your comps there. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Isaac, thanks. We're continuing to make progress at Beckman. We track our customer retention and we track our win rates very closely on a month-to-month basis. We're confident as we look at the combination of retention and win rates that we're adding to our growth position as we look out into 2016 and 2017. Obviously, some of what we see in retention and adding menu to retained accounts as well as new customer accounts don't necessarily manifest themselves in the quarter in which you've won them. In fact, oftentimes, it may take six months to 12 months for those to materialize. So I think we're confident we're continuing to make progress, strengthening the portfolio through new products, continuing to see good growth in the high-growth markets. But it's a journey, we still have work to do. We're not yet at the growth rates that we would like to see relative to the peer group. You highlight them well. And \u2013 but we are making progress and we're confident in the opportunities. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then maybe just a question on NewCo. Where are you in the process of sort of leadership selection and when might we know a little bit more about kind of how you're going to staff up the NewCo? Thank you. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we've publicly named Jim, obviously as the leader, but his entire L1 team with one exception has been named. They're all internal folks. And a fair number of people at the L2 level, the level below that, have also been named. So we're off to a good start on that front. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Isaac. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Gugino, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Eric. Thanks, everyone for joining us. We're around all day for questions. Operator : This concludes today's call.

We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion, and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially-oriented markets, we continued to build our competitive advantage and drove share gains across a number of our businesses. As always, the Danaher Business System is the foundation for our team's outstanding execution. We also made meaningful progress toward establishing a new industrial growth company, Fortive, which will be spun out of Danaher later this year. At our year-end Investor Meeting, we announced Fortive's name, branding, future operating structure, and additional leadership positions. We also achieved an important milestone in December, filing Fortive's Form-10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are confident that Fortive will launch with a strong foundation and will be poised for success upon completion of the separation in the third quarter of 2016. For the full year, our investments in organic growth initiatives helped drive solid 3% core revenue growth. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now over $20 billion. From an M&A perspective, 2015 was a historic year for Danaher. Including Pall, we announced or closed 14 acquisitions for nearly $14.5 billion, expanding our capabilities across the portfolio. Looking forward, our funnels at both Danaher and Fortive are strong and we'll continue to focus on small and mid-size transactions throughout the separation process. In 2015, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow, including over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio in 2015 was 123%, representing the 24th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We recognize the importance of this metric, particularly in a more challenging macroenvironment, as strong free cash flow is the fuel used to fund both our organic and inorganic growth initiatives. Now, turning to the fourth quarter, sales grew 12.5% to $5.9 billion, while core revenue was roughly flat. Core revenue growth, particularly for our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by four fewer selling days in the quarter. In addition, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 17.5%. In a weakening global macroenvironment, the Danaher Business System help protect and expand many of our market-leading positions driving share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Matco, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, and Videojet. In the high-growth markets, declines in Latin America, Russia, and the Middle East were more than offset by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in China. Notably, annual revenues in China exceeded $2 billion for the first time and we remain well-positioned in the most attractive sectors in the market. In the developed markets, revenues were down slightly due to incremental softness in the U.S. and Western Europe. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.3% and our gross profit increased by almost $900 million. In the quarter, core operating margin increased 120 basis points with all five segments improving by 60 basis points or better. Our reported operating margin was flat at 16.6%, negatively affected by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and acquisition-related transaction costs. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.27, which represents an increase of 13.5% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $4.30, up 8.5% from 2014. Turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues decreased 9% while core revenues were down 5%. Core operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily due to new product introductions and good cost management. Core revenue in our Instruments platform decreased at a high single-digit rate with declines across most major geographies. Fluke core revenues were down high single-digits as industrial markets continued to weaken in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East. In December, Fluke acquired Pacific Laser Systems, a leader in hand-held laser alignment tools, to enhance its product offerings for professional contractors, electricians, and general maintenance customers. At Tektronix, core sales declined high single-digits; declines in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East more than offset growth in China that resulted from solid execution by our local sales team. The team's continued investments in innovation placed Tek in a position of technology leadership within its industry. This quarter, Tek launched the MDO4000C, a mixed domain oscilloscope that combines up to six instruments in one unit. The new MDO4000C is completely customizable and upgradable allowing engineers to start with a high-performance oscilloscope and add functionality over time as needs change or budgets allow. Matco, a business that will be a significant contributor to Fortive's results delivered its third consecutive year of double-digit core growth in 2015. Even after three decades as part of the Danaher portfolio, Matco continues to find new ways to improve using DBS. By deploying such DBS tools as web marketing, accelerated product development, and lean conversion, the team continues to expand its franchise distribution network, gain market share, and expand margins. Turning now to our Environmental segment; revenues grew 1%, with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 21.8%. Water quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. A combination of fewer selling days and slower demand from our more industrial customers in the developed markets resulted in essentially flat core growth at Hach, while ChemTreat grew slightly. Trojan had another very good quarter, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American muni market. Hach delivered another impressive year in 2015. In addition to mid-single digit organic growth, Hach continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on acquisitions. The team has done a terrific job implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses to help improve sales and drive innovation. One such example is BioTector, which was acquired in 2014 and had double-digit growth in the quarter. BioTector provides online total organic carbon analyzers that help our customers monitor water quality in real time and reduce waste. BioTector's early and effective application of DBS tools such as lean conversion and funnel management led to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion, significant inventory reductions and market share gains in the chemical and dairy segments. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single-digits with strength across the platform. In the U.S., point-of-sale solutions and dispensers increased over 20% as our customers continued to upgrade their payment systems to comply with EMV security requirements. We expect EMV-related demand to continue to accelerate for the next several years. Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, core revenues grew 2% with reported revenues up 34.5%, largely due to our recent Pall, MicroScan and Devicor acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single-digits with growth in the high-growth markets partially offset by slight declines in developed markets. As previously mentioned, fewer selling days in the quarter negatively impact our recurring revenue streams across the platform. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate led by our immunoassay and urinalysis solutions. Utilization rates in Asia remain healthy leading to high single-digit growth across the region. In Europe, we celebrated our first orders with the commercial launch of our VERIS Molecular Diagnostics System. VERIS' streamlined sample-in, result-out workflow offers breakthrough ease of use in a market that is experiencing a shortage of skilled technicians. In short, it's helping our lab customers process more tests, reduce training requirements and save money, and thus far customer feedback has been extremely positive. Radiometer's core revenues were up slightly, a deceleration from previous quarters due to the effect of fewer selling days and a difficult comparison in instrument sales. Geographically, we saw healthy growth in China and Japan, while Latin America and the Middle East declined. Leica Biosystems had a good finish to the year, delivering low single-digit core growth as strong demand across most major product lines was partially offset by the impact from fewer selling days. Notably, the team delivered a record year of placements for our BOND Advanced Staining Instrument. Last December, we closed the acquisition of Devicor, a leading provider of breast biopsy devices and markers that moved Leica further upstream in the anatomical pathology workflow. Devicor continues to track well and has exceeded our expectations, posting high single-digit core growth or better in each quarter since acquisition. Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up low single-digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single-digits with continued strength in our clinical and applied end markets. 2015 marked the fifth year since our acquisition of SCIEX. Since then, SCIEX has proven to be a remarkable example of how thoughtful application of DBS principles can drive tremendous financial results. The team has taken a business that was growing below market rates to mid to high single-digit growth and share gains. We've seen significant improvement on the cost side as well, which has enabled SCIEX to invest those savings into higher impact growth initiatives. Progress at SCIEX continues today and 2015 marked one of the most important product innovation years in SCIEX's history with the launch of its X-Series mass spectrometry platform. The X-Series introduces an entirely new design, easy-to-use software and custom models for targeted application in routine food, environmental and forensic testing labs. Leica Microsystems' core revenues were essentially flat as strong performance in China and Japan was offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Turning now to Dental, segment revenues increased 17% largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core revenues were up slightly. Core operating margins increased by over 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to consistent DBS implementation across a number of operational areas. Reported operating margins were 15.8%. Revenues in our consumables business were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter, but our team continued to execute well and saw a strong demand for several product lines throughout the year. In particular, our investments in innovation have provided us with truly differentiated technologies such as SonicFill, TF Adaptive, and elements free, which all launched in 2014. In dental technology, we saw our first quarter of positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Top line results continued to be impacted by destocking within our U.S. distribution channels but to a much lesser degree than in previous quarters. December marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nobel Biocare. The team has quickly embraced growth, lean and leadership tools of DBS, helping to not only accelerate growth, but also improve operating margins by over 300 basis points since the acquisition. Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 8.5% while core revenues were down 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 80 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6%. Automation core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to weakening in industrial markets in China and North America. Despite the challenging market and revenue decline, the team continues to identify cost savings opportunities and delivered solid core margin expansion in the quarter. Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were up slightly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to extend our reach into new product idea adjacencies with the acquisition of Laetus, a leading supplier of track-and-trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. Increasingly, pharmaceutical tracking is becoming a regulatory and public safety concern and Laetus gives us exposure to this important vertical, and we're excited to welcome Laetus to the Danaher team. At Videojet, core revenues were up low single-digits, as strong performance in Europe and North America was somewhat offset by weakness in the high-growth markets. Results were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter. Throughout the full year, Videojet has placed a major focus on digital investments, driving key innovations in areas such as network monitoring, Remote Service-enabled printers and predictive maintenance. As a result, we achieved record new equipment vitality of over 40% for the year. These tremendous technology capabilities have not only solidified Videojet's leadership position in the market, they have also meaningfully improved our customers' experiences. So to wrap up, we're pleased with our record fourth quarter results. During the quarter, the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, significantly expanded core operating margins, generated record free cash flow and announced several bolt-on acquisitions. Despite the more challenging economic landscape particularly in our industrially-oriented markets, we continue to execute well. Looking back, 2015 was a remarkable year for Danaher. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with Pall, announced our pending separation into two independent publicly-traded companies with Fortive and drove excellent overall financial results. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, we believe we'll continue to deliver earnings outperformance and create long-term shareholder value in 2016 and for years to come. We're initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.04 which assumes approximately flat core revenue growth. As we announced at our Annual Investor Event in December, we continue to expect full year 2016 core revenue growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95, which would represent a 12% to 15% increase year-on-year. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Leo, we're now ready for questions. Operator : We'll take our first question from Scott Davis of Barclays. Your line is open. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Scott. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think \u2013 I mean given that it's been about a month since you gave the last guidance in mid-December \u2013 the formal guidance, I guess \u2013 things seemed to have degraded a bit on the macro side. I mean, what confidence do you have? I mean, now that you've seen I guess most of January, I mean, have things stabilized? I mean, your guidance seems to indicate that you think that was a bit of a blip, I suppose, so just a little color there. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Scott. I think, Scott, what we're assuming is that what we saw with some of the slowing in December is essentially the environment that we're going to see in the near term here. It's clearly impacting our more industrial businesses more than our other businesses, so we're not immune to the slowdown but I think we took some appropriate actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions are going to pay off here certainly from a margin standpoint, but I think the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio that we have today truly does differentiate us. And I think when we look at the opportunities that we have in our Life Science businesses, our Diagnostic businesses, some improvement that we're seeing here in our Dental businesses, continued good progress at GVR, while we remain cautious in some respects around the macroenvironment and are not assuming things get materially better there, we're playing offense in a number of areas that I think will bode well. So, I don't think there's anything particularly optimistic in our outlook around the macro, but I think some of the things that we're doing from an investment standpoint and across our growth initiatives should continue to position a very good portfolio and a differentiated portfolio and continue to move it into an even better place. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Makes sense. And then just as a follow-up, the emerging market currencies have degraded a fair amount. I mean, are you able to get local price to offset that? I mean, how do you manage that volatility, specifically, just given the exposures you guys have? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, it's an issue; I'd probably bifurcate the answer. Where we have the aftermarket business, the consumables, the service, we typically able to get price; with equipment and instruments, we're not able to, and we're taking a little bit of a margin hit there. Fortunately, the euro has stabilized so the overall currency impact is not what it was in 2015, but there's a little bit of a negative right now. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Good luck. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Scott. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Nigel. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, so just on the $0.40 from Pall, can you maybe just first of all comment on how Pall is tracking or how it tracked through the quarter? Maybe comment on the Industrial versus Life Sciences sides? And yeah, has the composition of the $0.40 in the plan changed at all in the last couple months? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Nigel, we're very, very happy with how we've gotten started with Pall, starting with the team that we have in place, a terrific team, both the Pall leadership team, many of whom have taken on added responsibilities. But in addition, the added resources that we've put in place and the leadership that we have brought to bear in the business, I think together, that team is off to a terrific start. We'll talk to the $0.40 and the cost opportunities that we have here in just a minute, but coming to the growth side of the house, about what we expected : continued very good progress and growth rates on the Life Science side, keeping in mind that that business has an exceptional position in the biopharma market in Life Science. So, we're seeing continued good growth there. We're also seeing outstanding growth in single-use technologies, which are a key part and a key growth driver of the biopharma segment of the Life Science business as time goes on. On the Industrial side, again, what you \u2013 what we would've expected, which is a slowing on that side of the house. We've seen that \u2013 those businesses impacted far more than obviously on the more Life Science-oriented side of the house. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that that business is also strongly skewed towards consumables. In total, the portfolio is about 70% aftermarket, consumables primarily. And so, that's a strong foundation and I think continues to give us confidence that while we'll have some segments that are challenged, the business overall will continue to perform quite well. Relative to the cost side of the house, again, off to a very good start. You heard us in December take the 2016 number up to $100 million because we had gotten off to an earlier start. We're getting the kinds of cost reductions that you would expect us to get out of a public company in the early going. The public company cost, beginning to get after some of the indirect cost leverage that we get and some of the procurement cost leverage that we get by consolidating procurement across our other businesses where appropriate. And over time, we'll see some of the benefits coming from \u2013 on the gross margin side as we look to the operational footprint, but that will obviously take a little bit more time. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, but that's helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Tom. And then on the balance sheet, you've taken down a lot of \u2013 an impressive amount of debt since the acquisition of Pall, I think about $3 billion of debt paydown. Given the bit more challenging macro, is there a change in your bias towards delevering this year? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nigel, I think we remain in that kind of $2 billion target for M&A this year. We are incrementally encouraged we're able to get some deals done in December, granted they were small, but we actually saw a flurry of deals get done towards the end of the year. Clearly what's going on in the high yield market has made it very difficult for the private equity parties, let alone industrial companies that have a lower credit rating. So, some of the anxiety out here is definitely helping some of the conversations. So, on the margin, we're a little bit more encouraged than we were 60, 90 days ago on the M&A front. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Oh... Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sorry, Nigel. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We may have lost Nigel there. Hope I didn't offend you, Nigel. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, we can move to the next question. Operator : Very good. Our next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. How's it going? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Steve. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you just maybe talk a little bit more specifically about Pall industrial trends? I mean, what is the organic \u2013 what kind of organic are you seeing there and what are you expecting for 2016, a little more precisely? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Steve, for the four months that we owned the business on a constant-currency basis, Pall grew about 4% on a combined basis. Clearly, it would've been accretive to our core growth here. Life Science was up high single-digits; Industrial was down low to mid-single digits. We see that for the near-term, not a bad way to be looking at the business. Certainly, the industrial piece is more challenged but more than making up for it with a very strong growth on the Life Science side. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, what was Pall's contribution to free cash flow in the quarter? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On the working capital side where we contributed north of $300 million of cash out of working capital, Pall was a nice piece of it, but maybe 15%. The working capital improvements were very broad-based, really exceptional performance across all the five segments. So, it was a nice contributor, but it was not an overwhelming piece. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then just one last question. What's the restructuring contingency look like in 2016? Is there any change to that as you kind of exited the year at a bit of a weaker rate, or are you in normal day-to-day planning? How extreme are things around some of the more industrial businesses? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve, I think one of the things that we learned from 2015 and we're pleased about is that we did a number of things throughout the course of the year from a productivity perspective. And I think particularly in an environment like this, it's important that we stay cognizant of the fact that there may be opportunities that present themselves, some things that we may need to do. So, we're going to keep the teams active at looking for opportunities throughout the course of the year, and we'll take advantage of those as they come up. So, I think we got a lot done in 2015. We got a lot more done in December than we anticipated, probably $20 million north of what we thought in December. So, that's a good thing; sets us up well a little bit more than we would have anticipated. But again, I think it's important that we stay (31:07) cognizant of the environment business-by-business and look for opportunities to take action where good projects present themselves. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Your line is open. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. What was the Fortive versus Danaher core growth, if you split it that way, for the quarter? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Looking at Fortive probably being rough down 2% to 3% and Danaher go-forward up 1%, 1.5%. So, I think that's roughly the way it would split. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And just a couple of things... Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Steve \u2013 I'm sorry, Steve. Sorry to interrupt. Just wanted to make one other quick point just for clarification on that. It's important to recognize on the Danaher side of the house, that 1% to 1.5%, that side of the house has a higher percentage of consumables and recurring revenue than you do on the Fortive side. And as a result of that, the fewer selling days in the fourth quarter has a little bit greater impact on the Danaher side. So, when you normalize for the days impact on the Danaher side, that's going to be potentially could be 1.5%, 2% maybe even on that side. Again rough numbers, but it has a little bit more of an impact there. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Oh, okay. All right. And then just on a couple of the segments, so I think this was the \u2013 it's been at least eleven quarters since I've seen Fluke go negative. So, maybe a little commentary on what's going on in the industrial environment, specifically on Fluke. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And then also Life Sciences & Diagnostics, it's the lowest I think I've seen in 14 quarters. So, you went through a lot of detail there, but to what extent are we \u2013 should we be concerned about any kind of bleed over from the broader environment into their markets? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Sure. We'll start with Fluke. Fluke clearly impacted by the downshift in the macroenvironment in the quarter, Fluke being one of our more industrially-oriented businesses. I think the macroenvironment, while it had its impact on us on a broad basis, also had an influence on the way our distributors were thinking about inventories during the course of the quarter. So, I think one of the things that \u2013 although we don't have all the numbers right now for full transparency on what happened to channel inventory, it's a pretty good hypothesis right now based on some early data we have that would suggest that there was some inventory control that went on in the channel that certainly would've had some impact as well. So, I think those two factors combined, again broad-based macro on sellout and probably some impact on sell-in based on inventory contraction. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On the Diagnostics side, Steve, the bigger piece is obviously Diagnostics, that's largely consumables, Diagnostics were up 4% organically for the year. And as you remember, Q1 when we had the extra days, we were up 6%; Q4, when we had the fewer days, we were up 2%. So, actually on a days-adjusted basis, Diagnostics tracked pretty close to that 3% to 4% rate all year including the fourth quarter. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Maybe one other thing to add there is that best we can tell, Steve, we didn't see any year-end budget flush there in the fourth quarter. That's a little bit more of a Life Science-oriented phenomena than a Diagnostic-oriented phenomena. But in some past fourth quarters we've seen the impact of that. We didn't see any of that in the fourth. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good news and bad news on that front has an impact on the fourth quarter. Sometimes that budget flush can drive some inventories out that then create some go-forward weakness as you start the New Year. We're hoping we \u2013 and the early numbers coming out here in January look like we're off to a decent start. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jeff. Good morning. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Thanks for that color on Fluke. I wanted to ask that question a little bit more broadly. To what extent do you think kind of the more industrially-oriented organic growth rates clearly reflect end demand versus maybe a broader channel liquidation? I don't know if you have any good insight into your other channels or any even anecdotal color there would be helpful. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't have much there, Jeff. I know the teams are still out talking to customers and trying to get a better sense of that. One reason for a little bit more insight on Fluke than and less so \u2013 Fluke's a little bit more concentrated with some big distributor partners that we can get a little bit more transparency a little bit more quickly. Some of the more automation sensors and control businesses and so on, more fragmented channels and it's just taking us a little longer to get any sense of channel inventories. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And just shifting gears a little bit, any thoughts on how the device tax plays through? Do you see any change in demand there or any change in the way people are pricing competitively, and maybe just size what you think the impact could be to your business this year? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Jeff, when the device tax was first put in place, the impact of that was very fairly modest on us. There's money at stake but overall, not a huge number. So, what comes back in terms of a little bit of a lift to operating margins is also modest. I mean, net-net, it's a good thing for the industry. We didn't see much impact in the market from a pricing standpoint when it all happened \u2013 I should say, from a competitive standpoint. We did get some of that back in price over time and probably some competitors did as well, but in terms of real impact to competitive dynamics, I think it's too modest a change, certainly to the scale of our business and maybe to the scale of others to really impact the competitive world. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jeff, I think we said in 2013 it was about a $0.05 hit. We recovered some of that in price. So, I think it'll be less than a $0.05, but maybe $0.03 benefit here in the year. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : We'll move next to Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe on Dental, can you just give us a little bit more color just sort of on the progress you made throughout the year? It looks like ending the year, you had some of your best results obviously adjusting for the days. And so, as we sort of now rolled Nobel into the sort of core and we think about the margin progression of that business over the year, help us think through kind of the pushes and pulls and how happy you are with the progress made. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Ross. I think 2015 was a year of very good progress across the platform. You mentioned Nobel; let me just start with that. We have a tremendous team of folks at Nobel. Largely the leadership team that was in place when we acquired the business, they have really embraced DBS and are off to a terrific start, both in terms of continuing to use DBS tools to drive growth, but also in my comments earlier, some great progress on operating margins. And now, as that goes core to the Dental platform, we'll see some impact of that to the good. On the business that existed prior to 2015, I think again 2015 was a year of a lot of progress. I've mentioned a couple of times that we've had outstanding relationships with our distribution partners. We work in a collaborative way with them on channel inventories throughout the course of the year. That was obviously somewhat of a painful process to go through in the sense of the impact on core growth, but net-net, a very good process in terms of positioning the channel efficiently. So we're pleased that the vast majority of that's behind us. There can always be a little bit of a tail to that of stuff we're still moving out in slower-moving inventories, but again, I think a ton of progress. We've also got a very good leadership team in place in our Dental platform today with some new players in place that I think are doing some wonderful things in terms of driving innovation. It was a very good year of new product introductions and I think we'll see the benefit of that as core growth improves this year. So we know we still have work to do there, but good news is there's opportunities for value creation as we go on here. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. And maybe just quickly a little color more on the M&A pipeline. Can you just give us a sense \u2013 I mean there's obviously been a ton of equity market volatility. We've seen obviously a shift in how the private equity folks are also sort of transacting. Just give us a feel for maybe healthcare versus industrial-oriented assets and the like, whether there is more activity at one side of the spectrum versus the other and how sort of the valuation dislocations have been kind of digested by the various groups, because you're obviously doing smaller things at this point and it's obviously the large end of the market that's probably been most impacted. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Well, I'll let Dan comment in a second on kind of the environment that we're seeing. But if you just look at what we did in the fourth quarter, which I think is a bit instructive, we got four or five small deals done in the fourth quarter. And by the way, a couple \u2013 two or three of those deals were Fortive-related. I mentioned Pacific Laser Systems in my earlier comment, but there were a couple other smaller situations that we were able to complete during the quarter for Fortive's benefit, along with a couple on the Danaher side. So, I think the fourth quarter was indicative perhaps of some things opening up a bit. I think the environment is generally a favorable one for businesses like ours with a balance sheet that's ready to deploy into small and midsized situations. And I think to your question, there are some folks who are perhaps a bit more on the sidelines right now than in previous days. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Your line is open. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. So Test & Measurement and Industrial Tech are both generating pretty good core margin expansion here despite these mid-single-digit declines. Can you give a little more color on how they're managing to do that? I mean, both of them have pretty good leverage in the models so that's a lot to offset. And what's going on in those businesses and can they continue? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Shannon, it is a real testament to those businesses given the challenging environment they're in from a core growth perspective that they are getting the operating margin lift that they're getting without the benefit of the top line dropping that through. I think it is a testament to the strength of the Danaher Business System, the tools that we use not just in newly-acquired businesses, but in businesses with long histories with Danaher that have gotten a lot done using DBS in the past and are still getting it done. If you think about some of the businesses in T&M, be it Fluke and the associated acquisitions around Fluke that have been done quite a number of years ago, think about other businesses like Qualitrol, like some of the businesses in our automation sensors and controls areas. Those guys are using DBS, whether those are lean tools specifically in the plants or deploying those tools in areas of SG&A, they're just demonstrating that those tools are still highly effective in businesses with long histories with Danaher. So it's kudos to those guys and they continue to get her done. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then you talked a little bit about the diagnostic comps and things, but Radiometer, that's been one that seemed like it was just going to grow to the sky forever in the equipment business. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Was a little weaker there. So maybe a little \u2013 just color, anything there to be concerned about. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, no. Radiometer is a tremendous business with a long track record of high single-digit growth at Danaher. I'm sure Matt or Dan can find how many quarters it's been, but it's quite a number of them in a row that we've been high single-digits and taking share. It's a high consumables business. It's probably in the 80% neighborhood of consumables so the days impact was fairly significant there. They also had a challenging comp in the fourth quarter on the instrumentation side, a couple of big orders that had some impact there. So, I think Radiometer is in as good a shape today as it's ever been. No meaningful shift in the competitive dynamics there, so we still feel very good about it. I think there was anything there, Shannon, that wouldn't be unique to Radiometer it's simply the fact that some of the growth that we have seen in the high-growth markets, while still strong in places like China and India, are still now very weak in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East. And so, even our best businesses are probably going to feel a little bit the impact there. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Shannon. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Just back on the Dental business, Dan, any chance you could give us the impact of the fewer days on core growth overall and how should we think about margin expansion for the year? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, it has less of an impact on equipment. We were up slightly in the quarter. It's the first time we've been up, albeit modestly, but it impacts consumables probably up, and as Tom alluded, to probably 1.5 points, 2 points when it comes to consumables. Good progress on the margin side granted we had a pretty weak performance a year ago, so part of it was a comp. But we've also took part of our incremental restructuring here in Q4 with the Dental, so we should see some continued margin expansion coming out of Dental hopefully with a little better growth than what we've seen here in 2015. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : That's all I got. Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brandon. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Just a question around Western Europe. I think I heard you say that sales were down slightly in Q4, having been up sort of around a mid-single-digit pace in the nine-month period. I think a lot of other companies have sort of been saying Europe's okay. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you saw there, specific countries or segments that slowed down. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Julian. I mean I think that was one of the areas versus what we expected at the beginning of the quarter that surprised us a little bit to the downside. It wasn't dramatic. Clearly, our consumables businesses over there were impacted by the selling days and maybe we were not as well calibrated as we should've been. But having gone through all \u2013 most of the business here's \u2013 in the first couple of weeks here, the tone in Europe is still decent and it doesn't feel like the step-down that our numbers in Q4 would suggest. And we think we'll get back to sort of modest growth here pretty quickly in 2016. Watching that carefully because it probably caught us a little bit by surprise here in the fourth quarter, but again, the tone still seems pretty good. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thank you. And you laid out the overall EPS seasonality through the year about just over a month ago. Maybe just talk a little bit about the Pall seasonality of that $0.40, particularly given the industrial organic sales trend in that business right now and how you would contrast that $0.40 impact versus overall Danaher. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the $0.40 should ramp during the year as we go after costs. Again, we were able to get some more things done in December, and that was inclusive of Pall as well, so we're getting it out of the gate a little bit faster in Q1 from a margin perspective. I think the offset, as you suggest, is the industrial side. So I think we'll get nice accretion here in Q1, but it'll clearly ramp through the year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Obviously good performance in margin in the quarter. Are raw materials \u2013 lower raw material costs helping at all with price cost? Did price cost \u2013 was it stable in 4Q versus 3Q? Did it improve? I know you mentioned covering FX, but are raw materials helping at all? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't have any great analysis on that yet. Given our gross margin, raw materials tend to be less of a factor for us than a lot of other companies you might cover. We are continuing to get price, still getting 60 basis points, 70 basis points, and it's hard not to think raw materials are helping us a little bit, but for us, it's really on the margin. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got it. And then how do you get visibility into what to forecast, for example, in the Middle East? I mean, the region looks like it inflected down a bit in 4Q. And with oil's recent leg down, how difficult is it to get visibility? And what do you forecast for 2016? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Andrew, there's a couple of different ways to come at that in the Middle East. One is simply conversations with distribution partners and a lot of what we do in the Middle East does involve some form of a distributor partner, and making sure that we have transparency as much as we possibly can into the opportunity funnels that those distributors are seeing, as well as making sure that the conversations we're having with our own sales team around those funnels as they roll up to our leadership team are as well pressure tested as possible. The key thing about markets like the Middle East is, particularly in businesses like ours, you have a fairly high level of project or tender-related business and \u2013 at least on the equipment side. And so, really making sure that we understand opportunity funnels and are not overly optimistic about the timing within which funding will be released, as in many cases that funding has some governmental influence to it, is really important. It is easy to have a sales team get overly optimistic that the timing of funding release is going to be the same as it was a year ago or two years ago when the reality is things may have slowed down and tenders may be being let at a much slower pace. So being diligent about how we pressure test those funnels is key. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So it's fair to say you're being pretty conservative with the Middle East forecast. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're trying to be increasingly conservative as we see how government funding is being influenced. I think it was interesting watching the course of the year. Oil continued to drop, as you know, throughout the course of the year and yet we actually saw our Middle East numbers hang in there reasonably well throughout the middle part of the year and it wasn't until the latter part of the year that we saw a more acute shift in the Middle East. And so there was a little bit of a lag there and it's taken a bit of time for the team to fully recalibrate. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Tom. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a quick question on R&D spending overall came in lighter year-over-year and versus our estimates. Did you throttle back on any spending or is that just timing of some of the projects? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. As you probably saw in the numbers that we put out, Deane, we're showing R&D down about 20 basis points, but the reality is, is that that was primarily influenced by Pall. And R&D spending normalized for the Pall influence was actually up on the quarter. So we're continuing to make sure that innovation is a key priority for the businesses and that R&D spending is maintained to the greatest extent possible for the opportunities that we think have the greatest impact in the next year or two. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then just last question from me is the incremental restructuring done in December, did you say what portion of that was Danaher versus Fortive? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It was roughly the split you'd expect, 70%/30%. And that 70% is Danaher inclusive of Pall. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Deane. Operator : And I'd be happy to turn the program back over to our hosts. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Leo. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're around all day for questions. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's Danaher Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call.

We're pleased with our start to 2016 as our team continued to outperform in the face of uncertain and challenging economic conditions. In the quarter, we delivered high-teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and free cash flow that was up over 50% year on year. The Danaher Business System remains the driving force behind our performance, equipping our team with the tools to strengthen our competitive position, the focus to invest in high-impact growth opportunities and the flexibility to position our businesses for long-term success. This will be an exciting year as we anticipate the upcoming launch of Fortive Corporation which we expect to spin out of Danaher in the third quarter. Since our last update in January, we've continued to build a highly-experienced leadership team, and have named additional members to Fortive's Board of Directors. The team has also made great progress solidifying Fortive's financial, legal and organizational structures. This separation is a unique opportunity for Danaher and Fortive to optimize our respective portfolios and build long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our Investor and Analyst Event in May at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. Now turning to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.08, an increase of 18.5% over last year. Sales grew 15% to $5.4 billion and core revenue increased 50 basis points as a number of our businesses were negatively impacted by tough prior-year comparisons and one less selling day. Clearly the economic environment remains challenging in many verticals and geographies, but we were encouraged by signs of sales and order stabilization through the quarter. Our team's focus on portfolio optimization and diligent execution using DBS helped improve and sustain many of our market-leading positions. Finally, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 2% while acquisitions increased revenues by 16.5%. Geographically, the developed markets grew slightly with stability in the U.S. and Europe. High growth markets were up low-single-digits as continued growth in India was offset by declines in Latin America and Russia. In China, our teams are well-positioned to compete in several attractive markets, and delivered mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter was 53.1%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Along with the productivity initiatives undertaken in 2015, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to sustain and expand our growth investments in new product development and sales and marketing. Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points with reported operating margin at 16.4%. Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Danaher as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We had a strong quarter on this front generating $622 million of free cash flow, a significant increase over last year. Coming off a historic year of M&A, we closed six bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, deploying over $100 million in capital. These deals will strengthen our capabilities across many of our businesses. Both Danaher and Fortive have strong and active funnels and we'll continue to focus on small and mid-sized transactions for both companies through the separation process. Now let's take a look at our five operating segments, starting with Test & Measurement. Revenues decreased 5.5%, with core revenues down 5%. Core operating margin decreased 135 basis points with reported operating margin coming in at 20.9%. Core revenues for our Instruments platform declined high-single-digits as we continued to face a challenging global market environment. All major geographies saw declines except for China and India. Fluke core revenues decreased mid-single-digits due to declines in the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America, partially offset by increases in China. While still a difficult environment, we did see some signs of stabilization in certain geographies and industrial end markets during the quarter. A few weeks ago, Fluke announced the launch of the Fluke 279 FC Thermal Multimeter, the world's first test tool that integrates a full-featured digital multimeter with a thermal camera in one device. This combination enables technicians to check for hot spots on high voltage equipment and analyze problems at a safe distance. By combining these important test tools into one, Fluke is helping our customers troubleshoot electrical issues more quickly, safely and thoroughly. At Tektronix, core revenue declined low-double-digits as growth in China and India was more than offset by declines in all other major geographies. The Matco team continued to execute well, delivering high-single-digit core growth in the quarter. Notably, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 23 of the last 25 quarters and continues to improve its market position. In February, Matco hosted its annual Tool Expo in Las Vegas. The Expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see new products, attend training sessions and stock their businesses for the upcoming year. This year, almost three-quarters of Matco's franchisees participated, resulting in record attendance and event-driven sales. Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues grew 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. Reported operating margin declined 220 basis points to 17.3%. Core operating margin declined 155 basis points and was negatively impacted by incremental investments, including EMV-related spend at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We anticipate segment margins to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter. The Water Quality's platform's core revenues grew slightly as one less selling day and a tough prior year comparison had a negative impact. At Hach, positive momentum in the U.S. municipal market continued but softness in high-growth markets resulted in flat core growth for the quarter. Trojan also saw strong municipal demand globally and delivered another good quarter. Finally, at ChemTreat, the team grew revenue slightly in the quarter despite headwinds in its industrial and commodity-oriented markets. One of the ways that we continue to augment growth, build our capabilities and better serve our customers is through M&A. Our Water Quality platform has acquired more than 40 businesses since 1996 and continued its healthy cadence of bolt-ons this quarter with Hach's acquisition of Lufft Mess in January. Lufft's long-standing precision sensors \u2013 long-lasting precision sensors, are a key part of weather measuring networks along roads, railways and airports and enable us to deliver value to a wider range of customers around the world. The Hach team does an exceptional job of implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses and this is well underway already at Lufft. DBS lean and growth tools are helping us drive more efficient production, strengthen key account relationships and improve funnel management. At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, core revenue grew high-single-digits for the third consecutive quarter. EMV-related demand in the U.S. drove double-digit growth in point of sale solutions and dispenser systems, and we believe we continue to gain share on both fronts. Many of our customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems for last October's credit card liability shift. Additionally, we're well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming outdoor liability shift and the Gilbarco team is already collaborating with a number of customers to phase in outdoor upgrades. You'll hear more about EMV and GVRs other opportunities at our Investor and Analyst Event next month. Moving now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Core revenues grew 2.5% with reported revenues up 42% largely due to our recent Pall and MicroScan acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 205 basis points thanks to the team's solid execution using DBS. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low-single digits led by healthy demand in high-growth markets. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low single digit rate. We saw strong demand for our immunoassay solutions and used our well-established installed base to help drive increased sales in India and China. Our consumable streams remain solid, and we're seeing healthy utilization rates globally. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems both increased core revenues in the quarter with growth in China and India offset by declines in other high-growth markets. Our team is focused on improving our customers' experience every day and shows that commitment by expanding our product offering through both innovation and adjacent bolt-on acquisitions. Beckman Coulter's first major bolt-on, IRIS closed in 2012 and extended our foot print beyond blood testing into urinalysis. Since then, IRIS has delivered double-digit growth and expanded operating margins over 1,000 basis points. More recently, the acquisition of MicroScan expanded Beckman's already-strong presence in hospital and reference labs into the microbiology space. It has been one year since we closed the deal and we achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Both IRIS and MicroScan are helping us serve our customers better and we believe that adjacent acquisitions combined with our consistent application of DBS will continue to enhance our comprehensive workflow solutions across our Diagnostic businesses. In our Life Science platform, core revenue was up low-single-digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. Leica Microsystems core revenues were up low-single-digits as strong performance in North America and China was offset by declines in Japan and Latin America. At SCIEX, core revenues grew low-single-digits driven by demand in China and the Middle East. We also saw healthy sales growth in certain applied end markets and our service business. The SCIEX team has placed a strong focus on improving our customers' experience by pairing service contracts with instrument sales. This has driven record contract capture rates including over 500 basis points of improvement in year-over-year attachment rates in the first quarter alone. SCIEX is a great example of how we use new products to help our customers' most-critical challenges. In the quarter, we launched the X500R, the first model within our X-series product family which was the SCIEX team's largest-ever development project. The X500R is a robust instrument that was specifically designed to serve customers in food and environmental testing labs, two of the fastest-growing end markets in mass spectrometry. Going forward, we expect this to be a significant contributor to our future growth. Turning to Pall, we are very pleased with our early progress. This quarter, the Pall team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth led by double-digit growth in our Life Science business due to demand for our biopharmaceutical solutions including single-use technologies. Our Industrial business was down low-single-digits as we faced challenging market conditions. The team's enthusiastic application of DBS including over 100 Kaizen events since close has led to meaningful process improvements and several product introductions across Pall's Life Sciences and Industrial businesses. As a result of our growth and productivity initiatives, year on year operating margins were up over 250 basis points. As we move on to Dental, core revenues increased by 0.5% due to strong demand for consumables and implants in North America and the high growth markets, as well as healthy orthodontic sales in China. These gains were negatively impacted by one less selling day. Over the last several quarters, the Dental team's focus on execution and disciplined spending has paid off in margin expansion. This quarter, the team grew core operating margins by 250 basis points and reported operating margins by over 500 basis points to 14.5%. Our continued investments in innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated product offerings for our Dental customers. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show in February, we launched over 15 new products, including Maxcem Elite Chroma, a revolutionary new cement for dental restoration that changes color to indicate the correct time for a dentist to remove any excess material. The first-in-class color indicator simplifies the dentist's procedure and reduces clinical risk. At Nobel Biocare, the team drove mid-single-digit average daily sales of implant systems this quarter. Since the acquisition closed, Nobel has achieved over 400 basis points of operating margin improvement and is focused on reinvesting those savings into future growth opportunities. Moving now to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 1.5% while core revenues were also down 1.5%. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin expanded 25 basis points while reported operating margin declined 30 basis points to 24.3%. The Automation platform's core revenues decreased at a high-single-digit rate due to the weakness in global industrial markets and a difficult prior year comparison. While we expect this dynamic to largely persist in the near term, we were encouraged by signs of stabilization in the quarter. Product Identification core revenues grew at a low-single-digit rate as increased demand for marking and coding was offset by softer demand for the business's packaging and color solutions. Videojet's core revenues increase mid-single-digits driven by what we believe to be continuing share gains in North America and Europe while high-growth markets remain softer. The Videojet team has delivered mid-single-digit growth or better for 9 of the past 10 quarters. Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Laetus, which extends our product ID offerings into track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. We're off to a good start with Laetus. The team's early adoption of DBS tools is already driving key process improvements, as quicker service deployment and improved on-time delivery are ensuring that our customers receive the best possible support. So to wrap up, our team executed well in the face of challenging economic conditions and we're pleased with our start to 2016. The Danaher Business System remains the driving force behind our performance this quarter, helping to deliver high-teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and 50% year-on-year free cash flow growth. We're also off to a great start at Pall where the team drove meaningful process improvements and delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress preparing for the launch of Fortive Corporation, which remains on track to close in the third quarter. Our teams are excited about the unique opportunity to continue developing two separate portfolios of market-leading businesses that we believe will create shareholder value for years to come. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.19 and $1.23, which assumes approximately 2% core revenue growth. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $4.80 to $4.95, to $4.85 to $4.98, which would represent a 13% to 16% increase from 2015 adjusted EPS. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Isa, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now take our first question from Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, Tom and Dan. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Scott. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: China was a bright spot for you guys, and I know last quarter was \u2013 I mean it tracked pretty comparable last quarter as well, but it sounded like things maybe firmed up a little bit. I mean Fluke \u2013 is Fluke your canary in the coal mine in China having that business back in positive territory in the quarter? Maybe just a little color on what you guys are seeing there. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. China unquestionably is \u2013 remains a very good market for us despite much of the headlines that would certainly suggest that there's slowing in various areas. We were very pleased with the performance in China, and I think it was relatively broad-based. If you looked at Danaher versus Fortive, let's say, Danaher was up high-single-digits in China, and Fortive was up mid-single-digits in China. So I think a number of good examples where China remains a very attractive market for us. Relative to your specific question on Fluke, Fluke is just \u2013 is an exceptional business overall. We've had a \u2013 it's probably one of our most advanced businesses in terms of both go-to-market as well as local production and product development in China. And while there's clearly still some softness around various industrial segments of the Chinese market, Fluke is a very strong brand in that market and has a very strong share position. So I think we're encouraged by some of the stabilization we see in some of the markets, and in other of those markets, we just continue to see very strong growth. Our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. Life Sciences & Diagnostics broadly continuing to perform well there. So, again, while clearly the headlines would show that that market has pulled back a little bit in the aggregate, it's still a very good place to be. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful, Tom. And then I just wanted to ask where you stand in Pall versus the deal model. Kind of help us now that we're a year in or so, I mean give us a sense of how you \u2013 what's working, what's not working, what \u2013 Industrial is probably far weaker than you thought it was, but the Environmental, or the I should say, the Life Sciences side is probably far stronger than you thought it would be. So how are you managing that variability? And how does it all really stack up at the end of the day versus what your prior expectations were? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Scott, we're in \u2013 it's Dan. We're off to a very good start there. We had mid-single-digit good growth in the quarter. As Tom alluded, that was a combination of double-digit growth in the Life Science side and a slight decline on the Industrial side. Clearly that would have been a contributor to our overall organic growth at Danaher. From a margin perspective, we are ahead of schedule. We've talked about north of $100 million of benefit here this year on the margin side, continue to track very well to the ultimate target of $300 million. In addition to this, we are getting favorable mix given the Life Science business is more profitable and we really saw that play out exceedingly well in the first quarter. It'll likely create some opportunities where we'll be able to accelerate some investments here at Pall during this year given we're tracking so well. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's great. Good luck, guys. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Just to follow on Dan's comment a little bit, the team at Pall has just done a tremendous job. It's, as we've mentioned before, it's a great combination of both some seasoned Danaher leaders as well as an exceptional group of folks who have been at Pall for a long time, who together have really brought DBS to life in that business in rapid fashion. You heard me mention about the 100 Kaizens that have gone on. Those have gone on literally around the world. And it's just one indication of the rapid rate at which the Pall team has adopted the tools of DBS, and really that has truly contributed to not only the growth dynamic that we're seeing, but certainly has assisted in us getting ahead on the cost takeouts on the margin side. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Steve. Good morning. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just back to Pall just to follow up on that, I think they were doing a little bit better than $100 million in R&D a year, and R&D year-over-year was up I think about $20 million bucks. Is that a little bit of a decline in the core R&D? Or are you kind of getting efficiencies there on the Pall side? You also mentioned you're kind of walking away from some business there I think in your 10-Q at Pall. Could you just give us a degree of magnitude on that front? And then I have one quick follow-up. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Steve, on the walking away from some business, that's something that Pall had started prior even to our acquisition. It's down to a relatively nominal amount here and we'll be... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think largely done by the middle of this year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then on the R&D front, what was kind of Pall's R&D? I think it was greater than $100 million. Are you guys getting more efficiencies there? Do you expect to maintain that R&D budget, increase it? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would \u2013 right now, we're sustaining and I suspect over time that will get increased. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So... Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would just add to that, I think we've mentioned this maybe once before, but if you think back to the play book that we ran post the Beckman acquisition, I think the play book here at Pall is very similar, which is there's a number of opportunities to get cost out of the business broadly defined. And we're working on those, obviously, to start to see the margins coming up. But the play book is to then redeploy some of that cost takeout into investments in sales and marketing in R&D. You see us do that broadly across Danaher with gross margins going up and sales and marking and R&D on the quarter for Danaher in total up 30 basis points. We did that at Beckman. R&D lifted over time. We started to get the innovation engine going. Innovation at Pall has always been a strong suit there, but we think we can take it up another level. So some of those cost takeouts will ultimately translate into either higher spending or potentially more efficient spending if we find opportunities to do a better job innovating at the same cost rate. We'll see. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just lastly on the free cash flow, a very strong quarter. Obviously, you're paying down some debt, beginning to delever here a little bit. Is there anything about the timing of that free cash flow? Or should we think about kind of normal seasonality off of that base? I know there were some accruals, year-over-year accruals were less of a drag. Maybe there's just some timing. I mean, maybe the bottom line, is what's kind of the annual free cash guide? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, Steve, you know we don't give a specific guide but we're off to a very good start. There was a little bit of timing benefit around some tax payments, but broadly our cash flow was quite strong. As you know, we ended last year with a record number and a very strong second half for free cash flow. We expect that trend to continue. You know, we're not going to be up 40% year-on-year, but we'd expect a very healthy double-digit increase in free cash flow this year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Okay. Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Our first quarter last year was... Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And we were a little bit light. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: A little lighter last first quarter. So a little bit of benefit there from a comp standpoint. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Cole from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Tom, so you mentioned you've seen signs of stability. I think that was in relation to Fluke specifically. But maybe if you could just broaden out the conversation to maybe some of the more cyclical businesses within Industrial Tech, Tektronix. What are you seeing today compared to what you saw back in January? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Nigel. Our comments about stability were not exclusively associated with Fluke. In fact, I think there's some pockets even around the Fluke business where we've seen stability, but we've also seen still some real headwinds. But I think we have seen stability in some other areas. You asked specifically about on the Industrial Tech side. The Automation businesses, our Sensors & Controls businesses, as we looked at those throughout the course of the quarter, February and March, we saw indications of stability. We saw those order rates kind of firm up a little bit. And while we wouldn't call it an upward trajectory, we would call those a bit more stable than we had seen in the trajectory of the fourth quarter and maybe at the very opening of the year. You mentioned Tektronix, I wouldn't necessarily put Tektronix quite in that category yet. It had one of the more challenging quarters. It's in one of the tougher markets probably that we face today. And so I think while we're very encouraged by the new product flow at Tektronix and we expect to see those new products drive some improved performance in the back half of the year, tech remains in a pretty challenging environment. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to environmental margins, obviously a lot of noise this quarter. You called out investment spending. I'm wondering if you could maybe help us size that impact. And it seems that this quarter you had a negative mix of consumables versus GVR growth. Is that true and would you expect that to normalize over the balance of the year? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'll need you to clarify that last question. I'm not exactly sure what you meant by negative mix relative to GVR growth unless you're talking about Water Quality versus GVR within Environmental. Was that your question? Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Exactly. Yeah. (32:55) GVR to the margin. Yeah. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, absolutely right. Yeah. Thanks, Nigel. You're right on. If you look at Environmental, which as all of you know both has our GVR business as well as our Water Quality businesses, GVR had stronger growth during the course of the quarter, very encouraging signs of the EMV dynamic taking hold. And GVR comes through that with a lower margin mix relative to our Water Quality platform which has higher margins, and specifically Hach. So a little bit softer Hach business, a little bit stronger GVR business during the course of the quarter together causes some of that headwind that you saw on the margin line there. The reference to investment spend is specific to what we need to do to build the capacity to step up to the demand associated with EMV. And so we see that in specifically in our GVR business, and those are investments that clearly will pay off as we continue to ramp our capabilities. And as we go into the second quarter and beyond, we would expect those margins overall in the segment to return closer to normal levels. Obviously, some continued investment there, but we expect water quality to come up a bit. So, overall, I think there were just a couple unique factors here in the first quarter. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great, Tom. Thanks a lot. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Go ahead. Your line is open. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Tom, you mentioned execution and disciplined spending at Dental with the big margin improvement there. I mean that's a segment that you've always targeted getting to much higher margins over the years, but it's been more of a challenge. I mean is this something of a breakthrough here? Or how should we read the performance and those comments? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, you're absolutely right, Shannon. It's been a challenge in the past, and we did set our sights and commit to making a difference there. We have some new leadership in place over the platform. Many of you have met Amir Aghdaei, who has led a number of our businesses over the last several years and some of our more challenging businesses. And he's really put a terrific team together. They've set their sights on specific margin improvements over time. There was some outstanding execution, some disciplined cost control. But similar to the comments I made earlier around the play book, I made reference to the Beckman play book and how that applies to Pall, while we'll continue to drive margin improvement at Dental under the team's leadership, we'll also take some of that improvement and continue to invest in sales and marketing and in R&D, because we do have opportunities for improvement in terms of our innovation cadence. We saw some modest improvement there in our core growth in the platform during the quarter, but we know there's opportunities to continue to improve that. We expect it to continue to step up, but some additional investment over time with some of that cost takeout will certainly be a help. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then, Dan, maybe a question for you on tax. Obviously a lot of new tax policies being contemplated and put into place that impact a lot of multinationals. Any, just, thoughts on that in general and potential impacts on Danaher as well as how should we think about kind of the two NewCo tax rates and any differentials there? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Shannon. Yeah, obviously it's something we're spending a lot of time on trying to understand better. I mean our initial read of this is, this is not going to be an impact to us, a material impact to us in the near term. But over time, we could see some rate creep because of it. Now that assumes nothing else happens, and there's no other opportunities, and so sitting here right now, it's not something that worries us a great deal. But it's obviously a potential risk kind of going forward. I don't think there's a big change in how we think about the tax rates of the two entities. We've talked about Fortive likely coming out closer to kind of a high 20%s tax rate. Again, I think as they begin to do some acquisitions, they'll have an opportunity to bring that down, and I would expect that Danaher would be at our current rate or lower. Danaher RemainCo would be at our current rate or lower. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Helpful. Thanks a lot. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Shannon. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, all. Could you maybe just clarify what \u2013 you talked about Fortive versus Danaher core growth in China. What was it globally for the quarter? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Danaher was up a couple points and Fortive was down one to two points, say 1.5%, I believe. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And, well, I guess everybody, what are you thinking about in terms of, current thinking I should say, on capital structure for the two entities? Where are you still heading for that? I know there have been some private conversations, but don't have a sense for where that is now. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't think much has changed versus what we communicated a year ago. We would expect Fortive to come out as an investment-grade company. You know likely they're not going to be an A-rated company, but something in a BBB range where they would be strong investment grade and clearly have a fair amount of latitude to execute M&A. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And if I could just one more. Tom, in terms of the R&D profile, I know you talked a little bit about it before specifically with Pall, but I guess overall for the company, where is \u2013 what level of R&D are we talking about for the new Danaher going forward? And do you see an opportunity to accelerate that at all as you think about also accelerating core growth in new Danaher? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Steve. I've said for a long time I've always believed that there is no magic number for a business with the diverse portfolio that we have today. We really look at continuing to invest in R&D to certain levels specifically at an operating company level. And that's obviously relevant for \u2013 or relative to what's important to those markets, what's important for our competitiveness, what yields the greatest levels of competitive advantage from an innovation perspective. So we really look at it sort of operating company by operating company. Our track record is a great one and it will continue of taking R&D up year-on-year pretty consistently. We've used our operating margin expansion that's been driven by improvements in gross margin to put some of that back into not only R&D but into sales and marketing as well. And again, we've done that very consistently. I would expect that we will continue to do that. One of our five core values is Innovation Defines Our Future. And we represent that in our metrics by continuing to see that percent of R&D go up year-on-year. So, again, it will vary in terms of the number that we achieve year-on-year by operating company or even by platform, but using innovation to drive competitiveness is key to our strategy. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. But what was it? I mean, what was it in the quarter at least just for the current or for the new Danaher? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We were over \u2013 probably in the same \u2013 Steve, we have the dynamic around Pall where a lot of the application expertise they bring to their customers which is a big part of their value add, they include in sales and marketing than R&D. So the fact that you saw R&D as a percent of our overall revenues go down 40, 50 basis points year-on-year, that's entirely driven by the Pall dynamic. But I would say that Danaher is probably in that zone where you've got some higher R&D businesses. But because of the way Pall accounts for their R&D, it probably averages to where Danaher is today, around that 6% range. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Maybe on the Life Science business, just a little bit more color commentary. You called out pharma as sort of a strong end-market it seems like on the SCIEX side. That market's been running hot for a while. I mean, how do you see the trajectory there? And then secondarily on the Pall side, biotech, there's obviously been a lot of concern in the market, particularly with the smaller companies on funding and the like. Have you seen anything in that side of the business, particularly with small to mid-size biotechs in terms of any relevant slowdowns? Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ross. Yes \u2013 no question the pharma market is an important driver of our growth across the Life Science portfolio. And we have exposure to that growing market across virtually every one of our Life Science businesses. Pall, specific to your question around biotech and small and mid-size, continues to perform exceptionally well across the biotech market. Just to go back and talk about a few things about what's going on in that market, Pall has a billion-dollar business today that's oriented towards biopharmaceuticals. And the combination of the solutions that they've had for a number of years along with the newer products in single-use technologies continue to drive the exceptional growth that we see there. That growth, as I think many of you know, Ross, and others know is really driven by this move, the growth and the transition from small molecule drugs to large molecule drugs. And not only are those the fastest growing segment of the market, but they're also the drugs that are most significantly represented in the pipelines of both small as well as large pharmaceutical companies today. So we remain optimistic and bullish on that market, and I think there's every reason to believe that we'll continue to see good growth not only from Pall but from our other Life Science businesses that have exposure to that market. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. And maybe just quickly on the capital allocation side. So a lot of equity market volatility to start the year. Private equity has probably been more of a net seller than buyer. I mean how has this sort of impacted asset prices on the private side in terms of what you're looking at? And does it make sellers more apt to maybe approach a process given they saw equity prices up, down, up again, maybe they're afraid they go down again and so they want to take advantage of maybe an opening in the sort of credit markets where larger companies can acquire? I mean I'm just trying to get a feel for kind of how all this volatility has maybe helped you a little bit on the deal front. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I mean volatility is a net positive for us as a well-capitalized acquirer. Your comment about private equity, it's getting a little better for them, but the leverage markets are still pretty tough. So I think all those factors play to our benefit. Now granted there are other \u2013 a number of other well-capitalized corporate players here. But we're happy to sort of compete in this sort of environment where there's a little bit more volatility and uncertainty. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, Dan. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ross. Operator : Question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Just a couple. First on SG&A, I guess, Dan, you kind of partially answered it speaking to the Pall R&D. But the SG&A moving up as a percent of sales, is there anything to flag there? And do you expect that sort of upward pressure over the balance of the year? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, if we first just take Pall out of the equation entirely, R&D as a percent of sales was flat year-on-year, but sales and marketing was up 30 basis points, and that was intentional. I mean we've stepped up some investments. We've talked about some of the opportunities in high-growth markets where we see people pulling back, and we see there's some opportunity. I think some of the success Fortive's having in China right now is probably a little bit of an example of that. And Pall brings in a pretty high sales and marketing expense when you kind of layer that in. That probably sustains itself. We see that as an important part of their go-to-market, not only their go-to-market but as I mentioned also sort of part of their R&D as well. So we don't see ourselves sort of cutting back on those investments, if anything given we have had a little bit more strength here earlier in the year, we may step some of that up. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And on tax, you mentioned creep and maybe there could be some offsets. Have you guys looked at this FASB change on stock comp and determined what, if any, benefit you'll have when you choose to adopt that? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We don't think it would be meaningful. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just finally, the six small deals, were any of those in Fortive? And if so, what? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : One was Fortive. It was an acquisition for Gilbarco. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And that's on top of a couple more we did late last year. So in the last four or five months, it's three deals, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, I'd just like to go back to the 2016 guide and just to clarify, has there been any change to the core revenue outlook for 2% to 3%? And then maybe a bit on the cadence of that through the year and how might that split with Fortive? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Deane, no real change to our view of the full year at 2% to 3%. I think our comments referring to some stabilization that we've seen here in the last couple of months I think suggest \u2013 as well as by the way how that was represented in the order rates, not just the sellout but the order rates in the last couple of months, suggest that we still feel pretty good about the 2% to 3%. So I think we're going to stay there. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And how about the expectations for Fortive in the second quarter? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We would expect that Fortive would be in the same zone, maybe a little bit better. Danaher ex-Fortive would be slightly better and that would roll up to be approximately 2% versus 0.5% of core we delivered in the first quarter. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then maybe some clarification on Hach, the softness in the high-growth markets, is there anything specific there? Is it tougher comps? Why might there be some slowing there? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it certainly was a very challenging comp year-on-year. The platform overall I think comped at 10% versus last year, Deane. So it was probably, among the platforms that we have, it was probably the toughest comp perhaps across the entire corporation. So that was certainly challenging. We have seen some delays in some key projects in a couple of the high-growth markets. So that was certainly a factor there. In certain of those high-growth markets, we actually have a little bit more industrial exposure than purely municipal exposure, and that obviously had an impact in those markets. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Again, we don't \u2013 that business, you know it well, Deane, is just one of our exceptional franchises. And we're confident that business continues to \u2013 will continue to grow over time and we'll see that business' core growth rate improve here in the second quarter. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then just last one and still on the topic of Hach. I don't recall ever there being a time where Water Quality has been more front page news in the U.S. with Flint, Michigan. And just what's your expectation about the longer-term implications on water quality, water tests and how is Hach positioned? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Well, we wish we had an answer today to the infrastructure challenges that lead pipes represent in that situation. It's just terrible to see the challenges that that community has gone through. But I think if we try to look on the bright side from the standpoint of the overall market dynamics, situations like that always turn the spotlight up on the importance of regulatory oversight in municipalities around the country, and frankly, throughout the world. And so, if those regulatory drivers continue to be strengthened, to be pointed at the greatest vulnerabilities in municipal and industrial systems, that, again, while challenging for those communities, ultimately benefits consumers and certainly benefits us. Regulatory drivers have always been a key macro driver for that platform, and they will continue to be so for as long as we can anticipate. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess on the Q, you sort of indicated that you're still on track to pay the $3 billion dividend from Fortive to Danaher. Is there any flexibility around that number if Fortive discovers a good acquisition? How flexible are you there? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, that's something obviously the Board would need to determine depending on obviously the size of the acquisition and what else they have in the pipeline. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It's fair to assume that there's some flexibility there. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nothing's set until it's set. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then just going back to GVR, the EMV investment and both growth and investment, is it fair to assume that investment is going to be front-end loaded Q1 and Q2 but you might see growth throughout the year? Is that the right way of thinking about it? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. There's clearly some upfront costs. And as Tom alluded, we also had some one-time items in the quarter and that will normalize as we get through the year. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thank you very much. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : We will now take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Just a question on Dental first. The growth rate was lower than I thought, particularly as Nobel should have automatically pushed up the organic growth a little bit and the comp was pretty easy. So I saw you called out Middle East and Africa equipment. But I wouldn't have thought that was a very sizeable piece of the business. So maybe just give a bit more color there. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Well, our Dental growth overall, Julian, was at a half a percent was basically in line with our expectations, modest improvement from where we've been over the last few quarters. And obviously as we talked just a few minutes ago, we're very pleased with seeing the OMX up at the rate that I talked about earlier. We saw solid low-single-digit growth in consumables and sell-out continues and actually is a fraction better than even our sell-in. So we always look at that sell-out. We have good transparency with our distribution partners, and we're encouraged by that. The Nobel Implant Systems business, mid-single-digit average daily sales growth in the quarter. We were pleased with that. The Ormco business, the orthodontics business continues to do well, and we're continuing to see on a geographic basis as I mentioned the \u2013 a couple of the high-growth markets specifically the \u2013 our business in China continuing to do well. On the flip side, on the equipment side, we have seen some challenges in Europe actually, and a couple in those high-growth markets where the equipment side has been held back a little bit more significantly. So I think as we annualize over some of those more challenging comps, we'll continue to see that growth improve during the course of this year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thanks. And then secondly, just on Test & Measurement, I wondered obviously that the trends year-on-year are sort of similar Q1 as in Q4. I wondered if there was any specific end market you'd call out that's sort of dragging on the growth now? Obviously, you do have some electronics exposure, for example, in T&M. Or if you thought it was sort of fairly broad-based, the weakness? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, there's certainly some broad-based weakness, but if I had to call out a couple of the softer spots, it probably would be the end markets where tech is most exposed and then probably secondarily, it would be on the Fluke side probably the U.S. point of sale has been a weaker spot here through the quarter. Those would be the two I'd probably highlight. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And you're expecting those to be little changed in Q2? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are. That's right. There's no indication right now of pick up there. Obviously, we can always be optimistic, but we're not projecting for any improvement there certainly in the second quarter. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Julian. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Isa, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're around all day for questions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher. Despite challenging economic conditions, we are pleased with our performance as the team's consistent focus on execution helped deliver solid core revenue growth, high teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow performance. On July 2, we successfully completed the spinoff of Fortive Corporation, a new industrial growth company. The earlier than expected completion of the separation is a testament to our process orientation, execution focus and exceptional teamwork. We continue to believe that the separation will provide significant opportunities for both Danaher and Fortive to independently build even greater shareholder value in the years ahead. Since we own Fortive through the end of the second quarter, we will start with financial highlights that reflect the combined Danaher and Fortive results. We'll then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher, outline our planned new reporting segments, and provide guidance for Danaher's continuing operations excluding Fortive for the third quarter and the full year. Since the Fortive team will be reporting their second quarter results separately next week, we'd ask that you please save any questions about the Fortive businesses until then. Now, turning to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.25, an increase of 17% over last year and our third consecutive quarter of mid-teens or better adjusted EPS growth. Sales grew 16.5% to $5.8 billion and core revenue increased 2%. The impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by half a percent while acquisitions increased revenues by 15%. Danaher remain core revenue was up 3% while Fortive core revenue was down slightly. Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up mid single digits led by double-digit growth in China and India. We saw better sequential performance in Latin America and Russia in part because of easier prior-year comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits led by growth in Western Europe. The U.S. remained roughly flat and we saw declines in Japan during the quarter. Gross margin for the second quarter was 54.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year. Reported operating margins were 17.9% with core operating margins down 30 basis points. More than 80 basis points of core margin improvement were \u2013 we had more than 80 basis points of core margin improvement at both Dental and Life Science & Diagnostics, which was offset by declines in Test & Measurement and Environmental segments. Free cash flow continues to be one of our most important financial metrics, enabling us to pursue organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter, up 14%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. Now, let's take a look at more detailed results across the Danaher portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenue increased mid single digits led by strength in high-growth markets and Western Europe. At Beckman Life Sciences, we continue to outperform. High-single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand in flow cytometry particularly in North America and China. The robust growth in flow cytometry was largely driven by demand for our new CytoFLEX product based on the breakthrough technology, which we acquired as part of the Xitogen acquisition in 2014. This bolt-on acquisition has been a tremendous success and is a great example of how we incorporate novel technology into our portfolio to enhance our offering and expand our customer base. CytoFLEX has been a significant contributor to recent share gains in our flow cytometry business. At Leica Microsystems, we saw improved results versus previous quarters as recent new product introductions helped drive low-single-digit core revenue growth. Two such new product introductions included are Leica DVM6 digital microscope launched at the end of 2015 and our new Leica M530 neurosurgery microscope, which is off to a great start in China after successful launches in Europe and North America last year. The M530 is a standout combination of our high-resolution optics technology with improved ergonomics, helping neurosurgeons stay focused during their demanding high-precision procedures. Core revenues at SCIEX were up mid-single digits, as we saw continued strength in pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. We had another very strong quarter in China as new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration helped drive increased demand around drug testing and food safety. In June, SCIEX announced a number of new workflow solutions at ASMS, the American Society of Mass Spectrometry annual meeting. These solutions are geared towards fast-growing markets such as biologics, proteomics, food and environmental testing. We showcased the latest QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer that provides enhanced sensitivity and selectivity to create a powerful workflow solution for biologics analysis. We also rolled out BioPharmaView Software 2.0, which accelerates automated data processing and simplifies reporting, enabling biopharma researchers to make better decisions faster. At Pall, core revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter compared to last year as a stand-alone company. Continued strong demand in biopharma, particularly single-use technologies, led to double-digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences. In Pall Industrial, revenues were down low-single digits, but we're continuing to see some signs of stabilization in those end markets. Pall continues to ramp exceedingly well across a number of key metrics. The team's commitment to the Danaher Business System has resulted in on-time delivery improving by more than 1,500 basis points with greater productivity and quality driving improved customer satisfaction. Since acquisition, faster-than-expected cost savings and meaningful operational gains have contributed to sizable growth and operating margin improvements. As a result of the team's impressive start, we've been able to redirect some of that benefit into R&D and sales and marketing investments. By pursuing this combination of margin enhancement and growth opportunities, we believe we can continue to drive innovation and improve Pall's competitive advantage. The Pall team showcased a number of innovations such as acoustic wave separation in our new single-use bioreactor at the INTERPHEX biomanufacturing trade show in April. Our expanded single-use product offering has enhanced our competitive position as pharmaceutical companies look to shift from traditional large infrastructure stainless steel systems to more efficient production processes. Pall's bioprocessing solutions help our customers save significant time, energy and money, while greatly reducing cross-contamination risk, which provides the flexibility to easily and safely make multiple products in one facility. Moving now to Diagnostics; core revenues increased low-single digits with double-digit gains in China and India, partially offset by weakness in the Middle East and the Americas. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues were up low-single digits, driven primarily by strengthened high-growth markets. This past June marked the fifth anniversary of the Beckman acquisition. We've made tremendous progress since then, significantly improving quality, delivery and our overall customer experience, while using productivity gains to help fund new product development and add feet on the street. Another quarter of good execution by the Beckman team contributed to healthy core operating margin expansion, and we continue to reinvest in high-impact growth opportunities. New menu additions are gaining traction, including our vitamin D and AMH fertility test in our amino assay business. Our recently launched molecular diagnostic platform, VERIS, continues to gain early traction in Europe. New product developments like these, combined with opportunities at recent bolt-on acquisitions like MicroScan, will continue to help build meaningful runway for growth at Beckman going forward. Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth, with healthy performance in Western Europe and China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East. Our growing installed base of blood gas instruments and AQT analyzers contributed to solid consumable sales in the quarter. The Radiometer team also recently launched the TCM5 FLEX, a new transcutaneous monitor design. This noninvasive monitor measures ventilation per patients in critical condition. And the TCM5 updated design is easy to use and reliable, providing nurses and doctors with improved usability while maintaining accuracy and precision. At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid single digits. Results were driven by a combination of strength in high-growth markets and continued growth of instrument placements in advanced staining and core histology. Moving now over to our Dental segment. Core revenues were up mid single digits with growth across consumables, equipment and implants. We saw particular strength in our restorative and Ormco product lines. Geographically, China had another strong quarter with double-digit growth, and we maintained positive momentum in North America and Western Europe. Nobel had another good quarter, with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. We've improved operating margins at Nobel by more than 500 basis points since acquisition, enabling us to direct some of our savings into expanded product offerings and accelerated sales and marketing efforts. This is similar to what you've seen us achieved at other large acquisitions like Beckman and Pall, where operational improvements help fuel renewed focus on new product development and go-to-market initiatives. The Nobel team has launched more than 20 new products since acquisition and featured a number of these recent innovations at the Nobel Biocare Global Symposium in June. Nobel's new On1 implant base remains in position during the entire restorative workflow; from implant placement to finalization and for the lifetime of the restoration. This helps simplify the dental surgeon's workflow and allows for an improved patient experience. And our new NobelParallel CC implant is a straightforward, highly versatile implant system providing an efficient treatment flow that can be used in a wide variety of implant cases. Both of these new innovations help us serve our customers with better solutions to improve their patients' experience and treatment. Turning to product identification. Core revenues increased low single digits. We saw increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies, partially offset by softness in some of our packaging and color solutions offerings. Videojet's substantial and growing installed base contributed to mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strong market performance in North America, Latin America and Western Europe offset softness in certain high-growth markets. Videojet recently introduced a new service offering that enables our technicians to remotely gather data from a printer that's experiencing a fault or a failure condition. This helps our customers return to normal operation much faster, often without a site visit. With our range of comprehensive, preventive services, we're able to improve end-user productivity over the course of a printer's lifespan, ultimately reducing operating costs and enhancing customer satisfaction. In June, Esko successfully launched a number of new products and innovations at drupa, the world's largest printing equipment exhibition, which is held every four years in Germany. This is the most important tradeshow in the industry. Esko introduced more than a dozen significant hardware and software innovations at drupa this year including a suite of powerful new software tools to help customers simplify, automate and integrate their complex packaging and label production work flows. We originated a record number of leads and orders at drupa, which we expect to help drive improved growth at Esko and across the Product ID platform in the second half of the year. Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenues grew low single digits with strength in Western Europe, India and China partially offset by lower demand in Japan and Eastern Europe. Hach had a solid quarter with mid-single digit core revenue growth. Results were driven by strength in U.S. municipal markets and Western Europe. We saw improved growth in China as Hach continues to benefit from ongoing regulations around water quality monitoring and analysis in the region. Hach's on-line water monitoring solutions are in place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for next month's Summer Olympics. Our solutions are installed at the majority of event sites, including the largest soccer stadium in the world. We'll apply our expertise to monitor water quality in order to help Brazil execute a successful Olympic Games. After the events wrap up, the Hach systems will be transferred to municipal water plants across the country, benefiting local communities for many years to come. At Trojan, high-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter was a result of a number of project wins in North America, Western Europe and Australia as well as robust demand in municipal markets. And finally at ChemTreat, core revenues grew low single digits despite exposure to weaker industrial and commodity-oriented end markets. So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well in a challenging macro environment. The thoughtful application of DBS continued to drive results with meaningful process improvements enabling reinvestment in high-impact growth initiatives. One of Danaher's core values is innovation defines our future, and the successful new product launches we've seen across the portfolio demonstrate our commitment to providing customers with truly differentiated technology to strengthen our collective competitive advantage. Following the launch of Fortive, Danaher will be a diversified multi-industry science and technology company united by common business models and the power of DBS. We remain focused on improving growth, margins and cash flow and will continue to pursue meaningful organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen our market-leading portfolio of businesses. Going forward, Danaher's businesses will be organized across four segments : Life Sciences, including all of Pall; Diagnostics; Dental; and Environmental and Applied Solutions, which includes our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses. For further details, please refer to the supplemental information that we posted on our website this morning. This marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Danaher and we look forward to the exciting opportunities we see in the years ahead. We are initiating third quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $0.80 to $0.84. We are assuming third quarter core revenue growth of 3% or better. For the full year 2016, we are anticipating adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, which at the midpoint would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015. Both our third quarter and full year guidance exclude the impact of Fortive. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Ashley, we're now ready for questions. As a reminder, we just ask you to please keep your questions specific to Danaher and save any Fortive questions for their earnings call next week. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. We will take our first question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, Tom. So, I just wanted to just fill in the gaps on the FY guide. You said 3% or better for 3Q. Is that the working assumption for 4Q as well? And then, what assumptions are you making in terms of the corporate dis-synergies in the back half of the year? I mean, obviously, there's a corporate line which is unallocated but then there's some corporate absorbed by the segments. I'm just wondering how that impacts margins in the second half of the year. Any color would be helpful. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So Nigel, this is Dan. So, Q3 we're talking about 3% or better core. I think if we \u2013 in that zone, in part because we have a little bit of easier comparison in the fourth quarter, core could be a little bit higher than that. Regarding the corporate on a combined basis, we've talked since the beginning and we're still sort of in that zone about $70 million to $80 million of corporate dis-synergies from the two entities, and going forward, corporate will remain in kind of the low $40 million for Danaher. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, does that impact the segment line as well, Dan? Or is it just within that unallocated line? So, I guess what I'm saying is the 2Q, 1Q pro forma segment numbers for new Danaher, is that a good base for the second half of the year? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just on Dental, you gave some details on the moving parts, will work out better in 2Q. But I'm just wondering, given the pretty soft acceleration from 1Q to 2Q, was there any pull forward or pull back from 1Q to 2Q? Was there some channel volatility? Or is this just natural volatility that we will see from time to time? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Nigel, we did see some core improvement without a doubt in Dental, 4% core growth in Dental, and a good part of that was clearly around better execution and to some extent, a little bit easier comp. We saw good performance in implants and equipment at mid-single-digit growth. Consumables, more like low single digit. Terrific performance in China continued. You've heard us talked to double-digit growth in China and we saw that continuing. U.S. and EU getting a little bit better and the high-growth markets, still challenging for sure but we are rounding around some easier comps. You heard me talk about good solid performance at Nobel. That continued. That said, relative to your question about any impact, there may have been a little bit of pull forward on some revenues just based on the nature of the calendar and the way the calendar worked on the end of the quarter but, in general, I think we were very pleased with the performance. Given seasonality, we could see some moderation in the Q3 growth rates at low-single digits. That's typically a function of more European exposure and the summer tends to be a little bit slower. So, we won't necessarily see a straight line to the improved performance, but we were very, very pleased with the execution in the second quarter and we think we've got a very good trajectory behind us that bodes well for, I think, the quarters to come. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks, and good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, Tom. Just on the segmentation, the new segmentation front, a couple of questions here. One, why is Pall Industrial stuck in Life Sciences? And then secondly, on Environmental and Applied Solutions, I thought maybe Water Quality and Product ID would be stand-alone. Are they just not big enough yet? Or is there a strategic thought here, number of segments? I mean, how are you thinking about those two? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Steve. Relative to Pall, we did think it was important to keep those together in a single segment. Obviously, the Life Science part of the Pall portfolio is the larger part of the portfolio. There's commonality internally at Danaher from a reporting standpoint, both in terms of both businesses, both sides of the business reporting into a President at Pall as well as an EVP overseeing all of Life Sciences. There's also commonality across R&D and supply chain and operations. So, there's a lot of reasons operationally to keep the businesses together and therefore, somewhat from a reporting standpoint as well. I mean, realistically, we probably could have split them up, but I think we would probably reevaluate that over time. And see how we might run the businesses in the years to come. But I think for right now, that's probably the best approach is to keep them together. In terms of Environmental and PID, I think those businesses do share some commonality in terms of serving some different applied end markets. We could have kept them separately. They would've been far smaller segments. So, I think we felt that those kind of went together and provided some flexibility for us as we defined ourselves as remaining a multi-industry company, there obviously is some flexibility maintained in terms of how we might add to that segment over time. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I suppose sticking on the same M&A or the same theme here on M&A, I know it's bumpy, but you did six last quarter I guess and zero this quarter. Was it \u2013 were you busy with separation, things just didn't come together? How's the pipeline looking going forward? What should we kind of expect in terms of momentum or pace on the M&A front? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve, it didn't have anything to do with being busy or in any way focused on other things. Acquisition volume kind of ebbs and flows over time and so we think the pipe \u2013 we know the pipelines remained quite good. We have active conversations in each one of the platforms, so we feel very good about where we are. We have obviously a terrific balance sheet to work with and I think we'll see good things in the quarters to come. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And you emphasize the multi-industry diversified nature as well as science and technology, but are you as optimistic on the Environmental and Applied Solutions I supposed in Pall Industrial front as you are on the other parts of the business? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are. We continue to have teams that focus as we always have in each one of the operating companies and in each one of the platforms focused on developing funnels, ensuring that we have active cultivations and yes we remain bias towards applying our free cash flow to each one of the businesses across the portfolio. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll hand it off. Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Next we will take Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. How are you doing? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Congrats on getting Fortive done. Hey, just maybe a couple of business-related questions, drilling in a little bit. Tom, could you elaborate a little bit what was going on in Environmental core margins in the quarter, why they're under pressure and kind of what the trajectory is looking forward? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, thanks for the question. In general, we feel very good about where those businesses are. I'll speak specifically to the Hach business. We had very good performance in the prior quarter \u2013 in the same quarter last year. In addition, we're making some investments from a growth standpoint in those businesses. So, I think we'll continue to see margin expansion from the Water side of the Environmental segment and I think those investments overall are going to pay off in terms of good growth rates in the quarters to come. So, it's not an area of concern for us. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Jeff, two things to add. One is Gilbarco had better growth than the Water business, so there's a negative mix in there for the segment and we had our best \u2013 best segment was Q2 last year was probably 150 basis points, 200 basis points better than any other quarter we had in 2015. So, a little bit of a comp issue as well. But as Tom alluded to, we are investing pretty heavily right now in the Water business organically. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Speaking of investment, maybe just kind of a total new Danaher question but the idea of kind of restructuring, be it quiet or otherwise, is that likely part of the equation here as you progress through the year? And could you give us some idea how to think about that? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, as we, I think, showed last year, we've established a cadence of restructuring that has gone on, you might say quietly but I would say more consistently and appropriately throughout the course of the year. As opportunities have come up, we've taken advantage of those in each of the quarters. And so, we still have opportunities for some level of restructuring in the third and fourth quarter. But in general, we've been more balanced through the course of the year. And I think that has served us well in terms of the operating margin expansion that you've seen over time late last year and this year as well. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then finally, just back to Environmental and Water, specifically in the muni markets. So, we've been kind of hearing for a couple quarters that things are gaining traction; obviously, had a strong quarter at Trojan. Could you speak a little bit to the forward visibility there? What's going on in order activity? Do you have top-line visibility into that business now into 2017? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jeff, it's probably a little bit early to kind of comment on 2017. The muni strength continues to be broad based, both at Trojan and at the Hach business. And at the Hach business, we're seeing it both in Europe and the U.S. Very consistent and healthy spending there. The offset of that both for Hach and ChemTreat is where we serve the industrial or any commodity-oriented markets. They've been challenging. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. Thank you very much. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Just on this emphasis on reinvesting some of the synergy upside at Nobel and at Pall into new products, go-to-market investments. What kind of lag are you expecting from that? I mean, when do you expect that to translate into improving organic growth for those businesses and just what you're seeing? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Shannon, it varies depending on where we direct those funds. I think in some cases, when we put investment directly into, say, feet on the street in either a developed market or a high-growth market, we tend to see those investments pay off in just a quarter or two. If we're talking about investments that go into new product development, those tend to have much more of a lag time. As projects get kicked off into early business case-oriented toll gates, you could have several quarters to it, at times, even a couple of years before you might see the impact of a new product investment, again, depending on how early or late stage an existing project might be in the pipeline. So, it's varied. I think in the case of Nobel, just to talk to one of the businesses, we've seen those investments pay off relatively quickly. You've seen it in good core revenue growth consistently in that business. They have relatively shorter cycle times in terms of new product development. In businesses like Beckman, for example, and at Pall, the product development cycles are longer, certainly significantly longer at a place like Beckman where oftentimes, we'll have clinical trials and/or regulatory clearances. And so, those new product investments can take some time, obviously. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then, yeah, maybe a follow-up to that. I mean, in terms of \u2013 in diagnostics, you talked about Beckman's growth being driven by high-growth markets. What's going on in the developed markets and then maybe it kind of gets to some of your comments you just made there but maybe fill out what's it going to take to get some better growth in developed markets for Beckman? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Yeah, a little bit slower growth in the developed markets. I mean, in general, the developed markets, from an overall perspective, are slower growth markets to begin with. We've always seen better market growth in the overall in places like China and India and the Middle East. So in general, I think we're tracking closer to the market growth rates than anything else. Still have work to do; there's no question about it. We have improved our retention rates and our competitive win rates, but there's still work to do in terms of both go-to-market as well as new product development. And over time, we do believe those will pay off and better growth rates in the developed markets. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question is coming from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Tom, just wondering if you can talk about some of the gives and takes, where you're feeling a little bit more constructive by segment in the back half of the year. You talked to the gives and takes on Dental, so maybe you can pass on that. But is Pall Industrial kind of bottoming out here? Could you see some improvement there? Obviously, the academic fund flows may pick up in the back half of the year and that could help SCIEX. So, could you just talk by division where you're feeling a little more constructive for the next couple quarters? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Good morning, Tycho. Thanks for the question. We do think that we're \u2013 as you mentioned, we've seen good performance in Dental. Again, not necessarily a straight line but we're very encouraged by the performance we're seeing. In terms of the other businesses across the second half, I think we'll see continuing better performance across the Diagnostic businesses in particular. We're starting see the benefit of a number of the investments across those businesses. I think we'll see continuing good performance from Water Quality. PID has been pretty consistent along the way, so I think we will see that continue. Our Life Science businesses have also performed well particularly SCIEX as well as Beckman Life Science. So, I think we'd see some modest incremental growth there. I would also remind you that we're coming around through some easier comps in the second half as well and so we will get a little bit of benefit from those easier comps really across the entire portfolio. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And since you called out Europe as a source of strength for Life Sciences and Radiometer, are you kind of comfortable with the macro plan in the back half of the year for these markets? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the Brexit situation certainly has created uncertainty around not just the U.K. but across European theater at large. Uncertainty is rarely a good thing for markets in terms of people's willingness to make investments particularly in instrumentation and higher cost instrumentation. So, I think that uncertainty could potentially result in some slowness in the second half but it's very early to tell. Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Tycho, we've been (38:43) on Western Europe. We've been consistently in kind of a pretty healthy low-single-digit number across Western Europe. It's been pretty broad-based. It is an area where I think because of some of the uncertainties in the last couple of years, we've probably taken a fair amount of share as we've seen some people kind of pull back in Western Europe over the last couple of years. So, it's been a good market for us and we're also seeing Pall doing quite well in Europe but those are, obviously, not in the core numbers yet. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just lastly on the capital deployment question, earlier you touched on the framework a little bit. Can you just remind us where you're comfortable picking up leverage? And maybe, just any comments on what you're seeing in terms of valuation given how much of this space is run? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, Tycho, we've obviously spent the last year in a significant effort on deleveraging. We're in really good shape. We're south of two-and-a-half times at this point. Initially, we're close to four times leverage. So, we're back to a mode of spending our free cash flow plus and we talk about a couple billion of capacity for this year but going into next year, you're back to more $3 billion to $4 billion of capacity per year. And that's not without \u2013 that's without really stretching the balance sheet. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : So I appreciate, I know you gave us already some color on Pall single use and on SCIEX, but I'd love it if you could tease out at all sort of pharma demand based on sort of customer types of sort of separate maybe pharma from biotech or emerging biotech to see if there's any sort of discernible trend you've seen amongst and it's clear Pall, obviously, having pretty strong growth across the board. But I was wondering if any of the end of markets, whether it's generic or CRO, et cetera, you're seeing any change in demand. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ross. SCIEX is probably the best business to think about when you think about your question about pharma versus, say, biotech. SCIEX has exposure to both those end markets and we're seeing good performance, healthy demand and fairly consistent demand from both sides of the house there. I'd have to do some follow-up to get you some detail on anything to do with the generics or the CROs, specifically. But clearly in the aggregate, these markets are doing quite well. Pall, as you mentioned, we've talked about the growth that we're seeing in the Life Science side, specifically around our single use technology product offering, where we're seeing continued double-digit growth rates in that area, and that clearly is associated with the growth in biopharmaceutical specifically in the growth in large molecule drugs. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : I guess what I was getting at is more on the zero charts (41:57), so maybe I'd ask it differently. In terms of just the high-growth markets and it's clear China has been good but outside of China, how would you sort of characterize the rest of the key markets? Obviously, LatAm has kind of been a mixed bag overall, but India and some of the other key geographies. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd say China in particular, India as well, are very good markets for us. But I would say that there's still a long runway ahead for those markets. Some of the generic and the CRO movement into those markets has been on balance, a positive, but there are also components of the market that are still relatively nascent, particularly in terms of what might be going on there in the future relative to large molecule drugs. So, I think there's still a pretty good runway ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thanks, Tom. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank, Ross. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, could you talk a little bit about capital deployment? I'm just curious now that sort of Fortive has spun out. How do you sort of view your overall strategy in the Life Sciences space? Do you still feel like you want to stay focused on the core \u2013 stand-alone core brands or do you feel the need to sort of become a more integrated provider in the space? Do you think you need to add anything to your Life Sciences & Diagnostics armament? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Derek, I think, first of all, starting at a Danaher level, our bias towards M&A is not \u2013 and the use of our free cash flow to M&A is not specifically skewed towards any of the four segments that I mentioned. We've had a consistent track record of capital allocation across each of those four segments that we'll be reporting on in the future, and I think you'll continue to see us do that. Now specifically to your question around Life Sciences & Diagnostics, what you've seen us do in Life Sciences is continue to broaden our product offering over time and I think you'll continue to see us do that. We have had a bias and we continue to have a bias towards businesses with not only strong brands and significant installed bases, but installed bases that drive good, consistent recurring revenue and consumables growth. The diagnostic business is inherently that way, typically, and you've seen us buy businesses with those same characteristics; strong brands, significant installed bases and strong recurring revenue and consumable streams. I think you'd see us continue to do that. We think there is certainly room to continue to expand our Diagnostic product offering and provide hospitals with broader bundles of product. Today, we provide products obviously to the central laboratory, the core clinical laboratory as well as anatomical pathology and to the acute care areas of the hospital. And with expansion of MicroScan into microbiology with IRIS opening up urinalysis for us, I think those types of expansions of our footprint would certainly be characteristic of the types of things that we would hope to do in the future Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's really helpful. Just one quick follow-up. It's been over a year since you launched the VERIS platform in molecular. Could you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of installed base and competitive wins and essentially, where is that going? What's the customer type? And then, I assume you're taking share from people because most hospitals have molecular platforms of that size, could you just talk a little bit more and some color on that? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Thanks, Derek. Just for everyone's benefit, the VERIS platform is a high-volume, random-access molecular diagnostics instrument that was commercialized for the first time in Europe in the second half of last year. That product line serves the core or central clinical laboratory of major hospitals. And again, as I mentioned, it's a high-volume platform. We're very pleased with the early traction that we've gotten. It is still early. During the first year of a significant new product introduction like that, the first of its kind by Beckman Coulter, it does take a while to build the funnel, but we've been very happy with how that funnel has built the sales opportunity funnel in the last year. The installations that we have thus far are running very well. We have four assays in the market right now, but the four assays really are just the beginning. There's a significant roadmap of assay development ahead that will ultimately be commercialized both in Europe as well as in the U.S. That product will need to go through regulatory clearance in the U.S., so it'll be some time before we see the volumes ramp beyond the early days here in Europe. But the feedback from customers has been very strongly positive, and we feel good about the start we have. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And when is FDA approval expected? Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I usually hesitate to try to put any bets on FDA clearance. There's a fair amount of work to do, even before we file for that clearance. So, I'll probably have a better sense of that in the quarters to come but I couldn't put a date on it today. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Morning. Just a question on margins, firstly. So, the core margin in total Danaher fell about 30 bps in Q2. Could you give that comparable number for the remaining business and how you think that will trend in the second half? And tied to that, I guess going back to the Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, the headline margin there was down 300 bps plus in Q2. Should we see that coming back in the second half as the comps on margins get much easier? Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Sure, Julian. On the last one, yes. And as I mentioned earlier, part of the Environmental issue was a comp issue that margins, on a historical restated basis for the Environmental and Applied Solutions were 200 basis points higher in Q2 a year ago. So, you expect that to sort of normalize. Core margins were relatively flat for Danaher. Ex Fortive, that was again somewhat of a function of the prior-year compare. For our full year, we continue to expect 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion for Danaher, ex Fortive, and you'll see better performance. So, very good performance in the first quarter. You'll see better performance in Q3 and Q4. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. And then, just on Pall Industrial, you called out the overall organic sales trend year-on-year. Is there any sort of color you'd give there on specific verticals or markets within that? Any changes? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I wouldn't say we've seen necessarily any changes, Julian. I think to the extent that there's good news there, I think it would be that we've seen some stability found in those markets. We continue to make some excellent progress in terms of our go-to-market initiative. We've done over 40 growth-related kaizens at Pall since we acquired the business. And a number of those kaizens have been going on in the industrial markets. And that involves installing DBS tools such as funnel management and transformative marketing that we think is improving our execution in those markets. So, I think the combination of seeing some stability across each one of those end markets in combination with the application of DBS tools, I think has gotten us to a pretty good place. So, I would hope to see some incrementally better performance late this year and certainly entering next year. But I think in general, we're pleased that things have stabilized. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Our final question is coming from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Thank you. I just want to ask another question on Pall Industrial. If we look back prior to the acquisition, that business was obviously growing a little slower than the Life Science side. But curious if you could maybe take a bigger step back and give us a sense of what you think it will take for Industrial to return to growth. Is it mostly a function of end markets, or is there really more of an execution issue? Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Isaac, good morning and thanks. I think it's both. As I was just mentioning to Julian, I think we've seen the markets themselves from a macro standpoint stabilize a bit; in other words, not get any worse. And we will need to see some improvement in the macro environment to see some meaningful or step function improvement in growth. But we're not waiting for that. Our focus is on ensuring that we have the best sales team on the field, that we're providing those teams with exceptional new product development, that we've got our coverage set up appropriately across geographies and across each one of those verticals. And I think the combination of good market coverage, DBS tools, new product development and some improvement in those end markets is what it's going to take. Obviously, the majority of that we hope to be in our control but a little help from the end market certainly wouldn't hurt. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, that's helpful. And then one other question on Beckman. If we \u2013 just trying to square up kind of what we saw last week with some of the peer groups in Diagnostics with what you said. Obviously, you've got VERIS and CytoFLEX helping out. If we pull those out, just trying to get a better sense of how you think you're pacing versus the overall market for Diagnostics. And any color there, especially in North America, would be helpful. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Isaac. Well, as you know, we had come from behind here from the standpoint of the big five in the overall market. I think from a pacing standpoint, we've now gotten to a point where we are very close to, if not at market growth rates with a couple of the competitors as you mentioned that reported last week posting better growth rates. And in doing so, in some cases, as a function of their positions in certain higher growth markets but, in other cases, we simply have work to do in terms of continuing to drive our new product development and our go-to-market initiatives. We're ahead of a couple other competitors in that market and we have demonstrated where, from a competitive win perspective, we've become far more competitive in the overall market. So, I think we've made a ton of progress but clearly work to do, and that work is, as you've referenced, is represented by some folks that are still putting up some pretty good numbers. So, I think we've got the initiatives and the investment levels in the right place to continue to make progress, and it'll take a bit of time, but I think we're on the right track. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks very much. Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Isaac. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're around all day for questions. Operator : And that concludes today's presentation.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter results as our team continued to execute well despite the macroeconomic environment. We delivered solid core revenue growth with very strong adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow performance. The diversity and strength of our businesses have served us well in this modest growth environment. The recent separation of Fortive was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio and we continue to strategically position Danaher for strong long-term growth through M&A. Since July, we have announced over $4.8 billion of acquisitions that will strengthen our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. In September, we announced the acquisition of Cepheid, a global leader in molecular diagnostics and we recently announced the acquisition of Phenomenex, an outstanding chromatography consumables business that will be highly complementary to our Life Sciences portfolio. Combined with the execution benefits of DBS, we believe these exciting strategic additions will contribute to Danaher\u2019s growth trajectory and superior returns. We look forward to welcoming the Cepheid and Phenomenex teams to Danaher. With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s turn to the details of the third quarter. This morning, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87, an increase of more than 20% over last year. Sales grew 17.5% to $4.1 billion, with core revenue increasing 3%. Core growth was consistent across the portfolio as each of our four reporting segments achieved at least 3% core revenue growth in the quarter. Currency translation had minimal impact while acquisitions increased revenues by 14.5%. Geographically, the high growth markets led the way driven by high single-digit growth in China and high-teens growth in India. Developed market core revenues were up low single-digits. Modest growth in the U.S. and Western Europe was partially offset by declines in Japan. Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from last year. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spend meaningfully in the quarter. Core operating margins were up 155 basis points in the quarter and 90 basis points year-to-date. This strong margin expansion helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, we generated approximately $700 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, up 35% and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. Now, let\u2019s take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenues were up 3% and reported revenues grew over 60% largely due to the Pall acquisition. Core operating margins increased 180 basis points and the reported operating profit margin increased to 15.4%. At Beckman Life Sciences, low single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by momentum in China, while developed markets were essentially flat. The backdrop of government investment in healthcare in China, coupled with Beckman\u2019s strong execution, contributed double-digit gains in that region. Beckman\u2019s particle counting characterization business had another good quarter, with double-digit growth driven by global biopharmaceutical demand. The team also launched a new product that supports drug discovery and development. The Vi-CELL MetaFLEX is a biochemistry analyzer that resulted from collaboration with one of our diagnostic businesses, Radiometer. Beckman incorporated the technology behind Radiometer\u2019s blood gas analyzer to create the Vi-CELL MetaFLEX, which analyzes cell cultures, a crucial component in biotherapy production. This crosspollination between Beckman and Radiometer is a powerful example of the unique opportunities we have at Danaher to bring greater value to customers by collaborating across the portfolio. Leica Microsystems core revenue declined in the quarter. Growth was impacted by weakness in the academic and industrial end markets, particularly in North America and Western Europe. This was partially offset by double-digit gains in the high growth markets as China continued to be a bright spot, particularly for our Confocal business. SCIEX posted another quarter of mid single-digit core revenue growth led by global strength in pharmaceuticals and food as well as environmental testing. Geographically, we saw declines in Japan and in Europe, where academic weakness impacted results. In the high growth markets, China and India each maintained strong double-digit growth. Our service offering continues to be a differentiator at SCIEX as the team drove further improvements in contract renewals and attachment rates in the quarter. As I mentioned at the start of the call, we recently announced our acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that supports a variety of analytical testing applications in the health, research and environmental segments. Phenomenex is 100% consumables, a high margin business in an attractive mid single-digit growth industry that is adjacent to where SCIEX participates. We expect to achieve a double-digit return on our investment in less than 5 years and believe that Phenomenex will help us to continue creating long-term value that\u2019s part of our Life Sciences portfolio. Pall delivered another quarter of good growth and execution. Continued strength in biopharmaceutical end markets and demand for single-use technologies underpinned strong growth at Pall Life Sciences. Pall\u2019s market leading solutions are the forefront of the biopharma evolution, and 9 of the 12 new biologic drugs cleared by the FDA last year specified Pall products in their processes. This is a tremendous testament to the quality and reliability that Pall provides to its customers everyday. Pall Industrial revenue was down in the quarter with solid gains in aerospace and microelectronics offset by declines in energy and machinery as heavy industrial end markets remained challenging. August marked the one year anniversary of our acquisition of Pall Corporation and the team\u2019s exceptional implementation of DBS has been a critical driver of what we have been able to accomplish thus far. Since the beginning of the year, Pall has achieved more than 150 basis points of gross margin expansion and improved operating margins by over 350 basis points. At the same time, we have been able to put some of that benefit back into sales and marketing and R&D. This reinvestment, combined with the team\u2019s thoughtful use of DBS growth tools, like accelerated product development and [indiscernible] has resulted in a number of key new products launching ahead of schedule this year. By delivering these impactful new solutions to the market sooner, we can deliver greater value to our customers and further enhance Pall\u2019s growth trajectory. Moving now to Diagnostics, both reported and core revenues increased 3%. The team\u2019s solid execution generated 250 basis points of core operating margin expansion and reported operating margins increased to 16%. Sustained strength in China and India was complemented by modest growth in the developed markets. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single-digits, with growth in emerging markets partially offset by softer demand in North America and Europe. Recent installed base growth in China contributed to strong immunoassay performance in the quarter, with the business achieving double-digit recurring revenue in the region. One of our five core values at Danaher is customers talk, we listen, and Beckman Diagnostics recognizes the importance of helping customers drive performance across multiple labs with different needs and different test volumes. One of the ways we differentiate our offering is to partner with customers and help them integrate Danaher Business System tools and processes into their labs and workflows. The results can be tremendously impactful, better speed to results, operational efficiency and ultimately improved clinician workflows. The effectiveness of one such collaboration was recently highlighted by a customer that operates one of the largest regional lab networks in the Midwestern United States. Within 6 months, Beckman helped them implement over 180 analyzers and 4 automation lines at 30 different hospitals and lab locations without any patient disruption. This customer was recently awarded a prestigious Advance Laboratory of the Year award for 2016 and has mentioned their partnership with Beckman and the adoption of DBS tools as a key factor in their labs\u2019 transformational success. Radiometer achieved mid single-digit core revenue growth led by continued double-digit growth in both China and India and solid performance in the developed markets. We saw robust demand for consumables across our portfolio of acute care diagnostic instruments. At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid single-digits in the quarter led by high single-digit growth in North America and expanding installed base and strong consumable sales contributed to double-digit growth in our advanced staining business. Back in September, we announced our acquisition of Cepheid, a leading molecular diagnostics innovator in the fastest growing segment of diagnostics. Cepheid has the largest global installed base of molecular diagnostics instruments, combined with the broadest test menu available. We expect this highly complementary addition to our diagnostics portfolio to accelerate our growth strategy and further differentiate Danaher\u2019s diagnostics offering. We also foresee tremendous opportunities with the application of DBS at Cepheid, which we believe will help drive better top and bottom line performance. Turning now to our Dental segment, reported revenues increased 3.5% and reported operating margins increased slightly to 15%, with 20 basis points of core margin expansion. Core revenues were up 3% driven by our equipment, implant and orthodontic product lines, while we saw softer demand for consumables in the quarter. Positive gains in North America were offset by weakness in Western Europe. Strength in high growth markets was supported by another quarter of double-digit growth in China across all of our major dental product lines. Since 2010, we have grown our Dental revenues in China from $15 million to over $150 million today and we are now positioned as one of the leading players in the region. We have evolved our business model as well in China to position ourselves as more of a localized player by expanding our R&D teams, increasing local commercial coverage and establishing manufacturing capabilities in the region. This approach, combined with our comprehensive product suite, enables us to provide a full service China-centric offering that enhances our customers\u2019 experiences and positions us well for continued growth in this market. Let\u2019s turn to Nobel Biocare. Nobel Biocare\u2019s core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate with demand for implant systems and regeneratives driven by recently launched new products that have quickly gained traction with customers. Similar to what we saw across our other Dental businesses in the quarter, sales in Western Europe softened at Nobel while China continued to do well. The benefit of the team\u2019s operational and cost improvements using DBS continues to help fuel Nobel\u2019s new product and innovation engine. Turning to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, core revenues grew 3.5% with reported revenues up 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points and reported operating margin was down slightly at 24.3%. In Product Identification, core revenues increased at a mid single-digit rate and we saw strong demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offerings improved sequentially and was led primarily by increased demand in the U.S. and Latin America. Videojet showed solid growth performance delivering mid single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strength in developed markets and Latin America was modestly offset by declines in China primarily due to industrial end market weakness. Videojet continued to grow the number of connected printers in the market expanding our remote solutions offering for customers and driving high single-digit service revenue growth. Core revenue grew low single-digits at Esko led by increased demand at MediaBeacon, which we acquired in 2015. As a reminder, MediaBeacon provides digital asset management software that brand owners and packaging managers use to ensure accuracy and compliance. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing, MediaBeacon has generated greater market awareness and demand for our integrated solutions, which support customers across their full brand and packaging workflows. At X-Rite, core revenue grew low single-digits with strong performance in North America and China partially offset by the rest of Asia. Lastly, turning to Water Quality, core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach\u2019s core revenue declined slightly in the quarter as industrial end market weakness contributed to softer demand in North America and China. We saw similarly lackluster activity in Eastern Europe as constrained government funding and political instability affected municipal projects. We anticipate better core growth at Hach in the fourth quarter. ChemTreat core revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate as the team delivered solid commercial execution and expanded their customer base in the U.S. Strength in North America and the food and beverage end markets was partially offset by lower demand in Latin America, particularly in the more commodity-oriented markets. At Trojan, core revenue increased double-digits driven by consistent municipal demand across developed and emerging markets. Our increased municipal systems installed base contributed to strong replacement growth and bidding activity was up low single-digits globally. A few key municipal project wins materialized in Asia as ultraviolet water treatment solutions have gained interest in the region. So to wrap up, we are pleased with our performance in the current macroeconomic environment. We believe that the steps we have taken to reshape our portfolio position, it positions us well for stronger growth and value creation. The diversity and strength of our businesses, combined with our team\u2019s focused execution using the Danaher Business System, is what sustains our competitive advantage. We believe that this combination will continue to serve both our customers and our shareholders well. We are initiating fourth quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth comparable to the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2016, we are raising our adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance to $3.57 to $3.61, which at the midpoint would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Erica, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning. Good morning, guys. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : You see the pattern that since you hired Gugino, you start putting up these big numbers? Tom Joyce : He has got a big team supporting him, Scott. We love him, but big team, big team. Broad-based. Scott Davis : Well, anyways, I am intrigued by, it\u2019s your one year anniversary at Pall and I am intrigued on how does that \u2013 have your results matched up with the deal model or kind of specifically, what type of return on capital are you sitting on kind of as you look point in time right now on that deal? Tom Joyce : Sure. Scott, we are very, very pleased with the performance of the team, both the Danaher team that has joined the team at Pall as well as the legacy Pall associates. The combination of those two teams has gotten the business off to a tremendous start in the first year. DBS has played a huge role in the progress that we have made there. As you might recall, that team had sort of begun the journey before we arrived on the scene, but the combination of the Danaher team that\u2019s gone in and the Pall team have really accelerated the pace of progress. There have been over 350 kaizens that have been completed both on operational side as well as on the commercial side. We have seen the tremendous lift in core operating margins in that business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we are now seeing investment in some of the sales and marketing and the new product areas start to make a real difference in terms of getting new products, not only launched, but commercialized on time and effectively. So, we are off to a good start. You know we took the improvements from a cost standpoint up from $60 million in the first year to $100 million. So, we are a little bit ahead of schedule in that respect. And I think, obviously, that lifts the returns here in the near term. Relative to where we will end up on a 4-year, 5-year basis and beyond, I think again we are off to a very good start. I think we have a lot of opportunity to lift those returns, but it\u2019s still early days and there is a lot of hard work to be done in the months and quarters and years ahead, but a great start. Scott Davis : And when \u2013 and just taking on Pall, when Pall Industrial comes back and I would love to hear your view on when you think you move into positive territory there, but when Pall Industrial comes back, would you expect outsized operating leverage on a cost out or how would you think about it, I guess, if you are on our shoes? Tom Joyce : Yes. Well, first of all, I think we have seen \u2013 while not the beginnings of growth on the industrial side, I think we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we have not seen another leg down. In other words, we have seen some stability. The industrial side was still down mid single-digits in the quarter, while the Life Science side was up mid single-digits. And so as those businesses begin to improve both from the standpoint of our execution and DBS is playing a role there from a new product execution standpoint and a commercialization perspective. When those improvements kick in and we get some lift from the macro, I think the big benefit you are going to see is in terms of the core growth of that business and the read through on an operating margin basis from that core growth. I don\u2019t know that it necessarily changes a trajectory from a cost-out perspective. We are working on the cost structures, both on the life science side and on the industrial side as well as across the horizontal components of G&A. So, I think the real lift comes when we start to see that core growth turn positive and we start to see the read through from that growth. Scott Davis : Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Tom Joyce : Thank you, Scott. Operator : And we will take our next question from Steve Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steve Winoker : Thanks and good morning. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Steve. Steve Winoker : To echo Scott, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 team is important, but don\u2019t forget Matt in all this. So, listen I want to just start with the actual fourth quarter core growth that you just talked about at about the same as third quarter. Just looking for where you might see signs of acceleration, how you think about that trending into next year? I know if I look at 2015, the third quarter was up year-on-year 3%, the fourth quarter was up only 1.5%. So just wondering, is this conservative in terms of how you are seeing, but to give us some sense of the fourth quarter if you could? Tom Joyce : Yes, I wouldn\u2019t describe it as conservative, Steve. I do think though there is a number of considerations that go into how we look at the fourth quarter. I think it starts with how pleased we are with the performance to this point in the third quarter, with all four segments driving at least 3% core growth. And I think now with a portfolio where greater than 60% of the revenues are in the aftermarket and where there is some stability in these markets, but not necessarily anything positive to write home about macro-economically, I think there is cause for some degree of caution in the outlook. You are reading same macroeconomic news that everybody else is and certainly that we are. There is a number of sources of uncertainty in the market today whether that\u2019s the election uncertainty in the U.S., the Brexit uncertainty throughout Europe, the questions around turns in some of the high growth markets or previously known as high growth markets as I sometimes say around places like Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and particularly those markets with a good deal of commodity exposure and certainly those with a high degree of industrial exposure. So, it\u2019s hard not to be appropriately concerned with some of that sources of uncertainty. But that being said we think we have got an incredibly resilient portfolio right now again underpinned by that level of aftermarket position and a portfolio we think that will continue to perform well despite those uncertainties. Steve Winoker : And as you think about extending that through next year, what would be the biggest things that would drive you from that 3% level to say something higher, even another 50 basis points? What are the few things we should be looking for? Tom Joyce : Well, first of all, we have still got plenty of work to do left here in 2016 before we get into 2017. And we will be going through a process here in the fourth quarter around budgets and be in a much better position to give you some specifics when we are together in December. But if you really stand back and you look at us today, I just mentioned the strength of the portfolio and the repositioning and the level of aftermarket that gives us a strong foundation, but I think we are encouraged about the continued improvement and performance at Pall with the addition of Cepheid and Phenomenex coming into the Life Sciences and Diagnostics portfolio and continuing to help us from a growth rate standpoint as well as from an operating margin lift and then as we mentioned before, we think there is plenty of opportunity for continued improvement in growth in our diagnostics business, in our life science, in number of our life science business as well as in dental. So clearly we could use a little bit of macroeconomic headwind but I think there is \u2013 excuse me tailwind but I think we have plenty of opportunities to play offense and make our own way in a good deal of the portfolio. Dan Comas : And Steve, just to add a few things, one, on a year-to-date basis pause up mid single-digit that\u2019s not been in the core number, as Tom alluded to that\u2019s with no benefit from the industrial side of pause. So even if industrial stabilizes a little bit pause should be a net contributor added to our core growth next year. Our industrial instrumentation business ad hoc has been weak. Our experience that tends to not last very long, I think that would be, we would expect sort of better numbers ad hoc here in the fourth quarter going into next year, so even those two items even before Sepi [ph] had come in, again Sepi [ph] won\u2019t impact our reported core number but will help our pro forma core number in 2017 as well. Steve Winoker : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I will pass it on. Thanks. Operator : And we will go next to the side of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Could we build a little bit more on your discussion about the outfit [ph] and muni activity, it feels like that has been building for a couple of quarters now and I just wonder if you could give us little bit more color on geographically what\u2019s going on and kind of what the pipeline of business looks here for the next call it 6 to 12 months? Tom Joyce : And Jeff, specifically on in the muni world? Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, muni world. Tom Joyce : Sure, sure. Well I think the brightest spot that we\u2019ve seen in the municipal world around water. Our municipal water business has been a Trojan where we have seen good performance this year, where we have seen double digit growth. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve seen increasing win rates and a reasonable lift in bidding activity. But I wouldn\u2019t say that that bidding activity necessarily suggests that that double digit growth rate is a sustainable one. This is more of a probably a mid single digit type of market. But we have been very encouraged by the performance at Trojan, their competitiveness I think has read through in terms of their win rates and so we are in a reasonable market right now. I think we are winning share. So I think that\u2019s encouraging from an equipment and an infrastructure perspective and we are seeing that globally. I think there is a different side of the story though which is on the municipal business in North America the day-to-day consumables business is not showing the kind of strength that I just represented at Trojan. We are seeing low single digit growth in that market right now still a very good market and that continues to be gaining share there but not nearly at the rate that we are seeing some of the infrastructure build out in certain markets. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. And then just on Phenomenex, I don\u2019t know a lot about the company obviously but interesting that it\u2019s a 100% consumables and I always think about the strength of your consumable business being tied to the inherent strength in your platform and equipment businesses, you know are there other assets like this that you know are kind of tuck-ins. Are these 100% consumable companies under strategic and competitive threat as you know folks like yourself build equipment business and if there is any perspective on how to think about just kind of the dynamics of that company and how you know that the landscape is there? Tom Joyce : Well, Phenomenex is a great franchise and it is a \u2013 virtually a 100% consumables business with great gross margins, gross margins in the 70% neighborhood and mid-20s operating margins but still with opportunities for improvement be it DBS and we are thrilled to be able to acquire this asset. We\u2019ve admired that business for a long time. We were able to acquire it at an attractive valuation and I think for those you\u2019ve asked us about return thresholds in the past, this is clearly a business that we believe we will achieve double digit return on invested capital in less than 5 years and so and that obviously for us is very typical for a large bolt-on or a midsize adjacency deal and really opens up a number of other possibilities. Jeff, this is a business to your point about install base versus consumables where Phenomenex has become the leader they are largely because they actually are equipment agnostic and they focus on specific applications and workflows that address unique customer problems and therefore create unique customer value. We\u2019ve had a partnership with Phenomenex at SCIEX for a number of years and it has been a very successful one but as some of you may recall we are also consumable agnostic in the sense of chromatography columns at SCIEX and so what this allows us to do essentially is bring a greater variety, a broader set of solutions to our customers without necessarily having to have those consumables be captive by that install base. Obviously that can be very attractive strategically when you have it but in the particular case of the life science world being able to customize solutions or these unique applications customer challenge is a real competitive advantage. Jeffrey Sprague : And Tom that doesn\u2019t create a channel conflict for all the other folks they were agnostic with and there are some bleed away on their other business as a result of it? Tom Joyce : It really doesn\u2019t, Jeff. Again, we have excellent relationships with other partners in the consumables world in life sciences. We had sourced from multiple, I shouldn\u2019t even say sourced, we had \u2013 we customized solutions for customers across a number of different consumable suppliers for a long period of time and we expect to maintain those relationships then continue to be focused on what are the specific needs of the customer, the customers today and how do we serve them best. Jeffrey Sprague : Great, thank you. Tom Joyce : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : And we will go next to the side of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thanks. Tom, wondering if you can comment on the academic market, you know the NIH data was pretty negative for September I think budget is down about 13%. And I know you called out some softness for Leica Microsystems. So, can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the academic market specifically? Tom Joyce : Sure. Good morning, Tycho. You know we certainly participate in the academic market in our life science businesses but it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t have enormous direct exposure to NIH. If you really looked at the direct exposure across a number of our businesses, we are probably in the $150 million or less with direct exposure to NIH funding. Now there is more than that in terms of indirect funding but I would say that funding issue that you mentioned clearly has had an impact on a broad basis when you talk about a variety of things that are indirectly funded or go through a number of different stages before they ultimately get to a supplier like us. We have seen weakness in that market. We have not seen any particular cause for optimism in the academic market particularly in the U.S. Europe has hung in there in pockets. Japan is weak and certainly continues to be that way. So it\u2019s not an area of strength right now and clearly the NIH funding issues have not been net particularly helpful. Dan Comas : And Tycho, I would add that we probably saw a little bit more of a bifurcation life science in the quarter meaning that biopharma remain very strong, traditional farm, food and environmental remain solid consistent what we saw in the first half but we did see both academic and sort of industrial markets particularly at Leica weaken in the third quarter. Tycho Peterson : That\u2019s helpful. And then on Beckman if I kind of go back to your comments last quarter, I think you talked about growing at a market rate, if you look at the results from some of the peers, they are still going little bit faster including in the high single digit range for one of them. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about you know your view of whether you can get Beckman back to maybe a mid single digit growth trajectory? Tom Joyce : We absolutely believe that we can do that, Tycho. We have made terrific progress thus far. We have seen improvement certainly in our clinical chemistry and our immunoassay business. Our urinalysis business continues to perform very, very well. That business is up double-digits in the third quarter. And I think with the addition of Cepheid in a broader position in molecular diagnostics, particularly with the potential growth that\u2019s available in \u2013 at the point of care and potentially ultimately in the physician office lab, we do believe that both the core legacy business of Beckman will improve its growth trajectory over time. With the addition of those higher growth segments that we have acquired will be accretive to that growth profile. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then just one last quick one, can you quantify the biopharma growth from Pall that you saw in the quarter? Tom Joyce : The life Science businesses overall was up mid single-digits on the quarter and the single use business continues to grow straight at a double-digit rate. And so we continue to see good and consistent performance on the biopharma side. Tycho Peterson : Right. Thank you. Tom Joyce : Thank you, Tycho. Operator : And we will go next to the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Good morning gentlemen. So on Dental, it\u2019s sort of interesting, I mean the macro has been alright, I would guess in the U.S., but it feels like on North American consumables, we are seeing a little bit of choppiness, curious that sort of your thoughts for that. And then conversely, it seems like overall the segment is doing quite well, but its equipment, which I guess doesn\u2019t sort of correspond with the macro question. And then on the implant side, where it seems like you are doing quite well with the Nobel acquisition, so help us kind of make sense of what you are seeing in the segment and how much is market related and how much is better execution on your end and some of the segments that are outperforming? Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks Ross. Good morning. We are pleased with how the Dental business, the segment performed in the quarter, up 3%. And there was clearly some better execution on our side in a number of different areas and you have heard us speak in the past about some of the changes that we have made both organizationally and operationally. We have realigned our investments into some key areas from a new product perspective and we are seeing the benefits there. Relative to the specific portions of the business that you mentioned, we are seeing strength in our equipment business, up mid single-digits and yes, the consumable business, up more like low single-digits. And really, I think that have to do with a couple of different factors. We are executing well in the equipment side. We have new product initiatives that are making a difference there. And overall, I think we are well positioned from a portfolio perspective. You have heard the narrative from a number of different folks in the market around some softness during the course of July and August. I think we as the quarter came to a close in September we started to certainly see some of that play through. And I think absolutely varies by geography as well. I mentioned double-digit growth in places like China and India, but the U.S. much lower and certainly we are seeing some softness in Europe as well as Latin America and the Middle East. So definitely it\u2019s a tale of two cities. U.S. also about the equipment, the implant side, Nobel continues to perform very well. They have got a number of new products in the market right now, which are helping in that growth rate. And they are executing well just on a commercial basis day in and day out. And some of that obviously has been a function of the implementation of DBS on the cost side where we have been able to reallocate some of those funds into investments in sales and marketing as well as in R&D. Particularly in the third quarter, we made some significant investments in sales and marketing. And I think will pay off \u2013 that we will continue to pay off at Nobel with even improving growth rates. Ross Muken : Great. And maybe just moving back to the capital allocation, you guys have obviously been quite busy and obviously since you have taken over, there has been a distinct bias towards growth, I guess what should we learn about your vision of what Danaher will be over the next 5 years or 10 years based on these assets, you have obviously gotten some real crown jewels within the tools, complex and Phenomenex and Pall and obviously in Cepheid you got a high growth potential, so how should we think about how you are sort of reshaping this portfolio and what the \u2013 I am not looking for quantitative, but maybe more qualitatively, how do you think about the evolution of these assets at this point? Tom Joyce : Sure. Ross, we have gotten quite a bit done here in the last couple of years with the separation that took place with Fortive and getting Fortive off to a great start, but then making some very important and strategic acquisitions to shore up really what were three of the most important strategic needs or opportunities that we had. Nobel, on the implant and consumable side, as you mentioned Pall, to enhance our Life Sciences, specifically biopharmaceutical production position and then Cepheid, to improve our position relative to molecular diagnostics. We have had a focus strategically on the consumable side of Life Science and Phenomenex to use your term, a crown jewel in the consumable side of Life Science. So I think we feel very good about where we are right now. I wouldn\u2019t trade our portfolio, the four segments that we have today of Diagnostics, Life Science, Dental and Environmental and Applied Solutions for any portfolio in the market. And I think the game plan in the years ahead, as it has been in the past, is continued to deploy our free cash flow strategically with a strong bias towards M&A into these highly attractive segments. And I think the game plan, at least in the near-term here, given the current position of the balance sheet and all that we have to do operationally with these acquisitions is to focus on probably small or midsize bolt-ons that are strategically important to our position, that hopefully will, as these have done, will be accretive to our growth rates and improve our growth trajectories. And hopefully, that would be the case certainly on the margin side, if not initially, certainly over time. So I think that\u2019s the game going forward and it\u2019s been the plan over the last couple of years. Ross Muken : Great. Thank you. Tom Joyce : Thank you, Ross. Operator : And we will go next to the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. My first question is on high growth market trends, in the third quarter, high growth market revenue growth was I think around, I think you said mid single-digits, as you described that there continue to be some headwinds relative to what we have seen at least compared to historical trends, recognizing a lot of this is out of control, I am just wondering if you would speak a little bit about the actions and investments you are taking to better position these markets for better growth in 2017? Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks for that question. I think we have \u2013 as we look at the high growth markets today, I am not sure we would necessarily say that there was much of a change recently in those markets, we have continued to see strength in China across a number of our businesses, if not all, business in China is up high single-digits. Real strength in Life Science, in Dental, in Diagnostics, some softness in the market and VideoJet, those are businesses where that softness largely comes from equipment than more industrially oriented end markets. And you have heard me mention a number of times, the strength that we have seen in India, which has been very consistent level strength over the last couple of years. And with those two markets being what they are, both the scale of those markets, the inherent growth rates in those markets and the strength of our positions, those are really where a great deal of our investments are going. We are largely doubling down in the markets where we have the greatest opportunities for growth in the near-term. We \u2013 what improvement we have seen and it\u2019s been very modest in places like Latin America, Brazil specifically and Russia are really more about easier comps than materially improved market conditions. And the Middle East continues to be weak. And so while we have sustained our positions there in terms of our feet on the street and our investments in commercializing new products in those markets, those have not been markets where we are significantly accelerating our investments today. Instead, the biggest incremental investments are going into those markets where we are seeing continued strength. Doug Schenkel : Great, that\u2019s helpful and insightful. Thank you for that. My second question is on Diagnostic core margins, they improved 250 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. Yes, there was some nice improvement in the first half of about 210 basis points year-over-year. So, it\u2019s got even better in Q3. Some of this maybe a function of comps, but to the extent it isn\u2019t, could you provide a bit more detail on what\u2019s really driving accelerating improvement and how we should think about sustainability? Tom Joyce : Well, we are certainly seeing continued improvement in the margin performance at Beckman Diagnostics. Across our Diagnostics portfolio, you have Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, both businesses we have owned for a number of years and have made tremendous progress in enhancing their operating margins. Beckman, obviously a more recent acquisition, but still 5 years ago, we have seen great lift in those operating margins to this point. But as I mentioned, Beckman represents a large business. It still has quite a bit of headroom for margin improvement. And so we have seen at this point, but we think there is more runway ahead. Doug Schenkel : So really \u2013 sorry... Dan Comas : Yes, Doug, it\u2019s Dan. We did benefit in Q3 with a slightly easier comp despite having said that, again, it was a very strong quarter of core margin expansion. What we are seeing is continued increase in the gross margin side, continued leverage on the G&A side while we are also stepping up R&D and sales and marketing. So, we are seeing the mix you would like to see from a margin perspective where we are getting the expansion, where we are taking part of that and putting that into more growth investments. Doug Schenkel : That\u2019s great. That\u2019s kind of what I was getting at, is it a continuation of trend which has been good or things actually getting a little bit even better which it kind of sounds like they are. Last one, there is clearly been a lot of questions about what\u2019s going on in different geographies and different end markets and you guys have been great at providing a lot of directional qualitative information to help us out there. I just figured I would ask in case you guys will be willing to whether or not you could just give us core revenue growth by end market and by developed geography in the quarter across all businesses? Dan Comas : Well, we don\u2019t give quite that level of detail, but we did talk about continued double-digit kind of mid-teens growth in India, high single-digit growth in China. Both the U.S. and Western Europe were up low single-digit. That\u2019s been pretty consistent. I would add as a footnote probably seeing some incremental signs of weakness in Western Europe where our overall numbers in Q3 were pretty comparable to what we had in the first half. Tom alluded to the academic comment seeing a little bit of that industrial weakness in places like Hach, not a big change, but probably on the margin the tone is a little bit cautious in Western Europe. And Japan, we continue to be down low to mid single-digits. Doug Schenkel : Okay, thank you again. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Doug. Operator : We will go next to the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin : Hey, good morning. So, before I ask another geography question, I just wanted to ask a Diagnostics question. So, it\u2019s been \u2013 you have closed the Cepheid or you haven\u2019t closed it, but you have announced the Cepheid transaction, you have had a little bit more time to think about it. Any further additional thoughts on where you think you can ultimately get the gross margin on the Cepheid products? That was sort of a topic when we did the call the last time, I just wonder if you have any further thoughts on it? Tom Joyce : Derik thanks. I don\u2019t know that we have a lot more to offer. During due diligence, we were able to spend a good deal of time with the team and understand the roadmap that they have laid out for gross margin. You have heard a lot of that from the business in terms of the opportunities around improving the cost structure of the cartridge. We think those are \u2013 that\u2019s very credible. We think they got solid roadmap for executing on those improvements. And obviously, once we have closed the transaction, we can engage directly with them, we will be bringing the tools of the Danaher Business System that we have used successfully in a number of other businesses to improve gross margins. You just heard Dan commented what we have done at Beckman and we will obviously bring that to bear at Cepheid and I think you will see those improvements come through. Derik de Bruin : Great. And just one more Western Europe question, are you seeing \u2013 is it budget delays that you are seeing or people just canceling orders or people just hesitating on spending? Just a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on in terms of specific trends, if there is anything you can sort of draw from what you are seeing across the businesses? Tom Joyce : Derik, was that a Europe question, I am sorry? Derik de Bruin : The Western Europe question, yes. Tom Joyce : Yes. Much more in terms of delays, event cancellations, we tend to see both at the tendering level as well as at the purchase order level folks hanging back in certain cases, it\u2019s because budgets haven\u2019t been fully approved yet. In other cases, they are just trying to get paperwork through approvals. And normally, that\u2019s a circumstance where because of some levels of austerity folks are just slowing things down. Derik de Bruin : Great, thanks. Operator : And our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Tom Joyce : Hi, Nigel. Dan Comas : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yes. So, we covered a lot of ground, so I will keep this relatively quick. But I did want to come back to Dental there is obviously a lot of noise from some of the competitors regarding the U.S. channel. So, I am just wondering given the vocabulary we have seen, the large recovery we have seen core growth rates in dental, how confident are you \u2013 you can sustain this level of growth in the sort of the 3% plus bracket? Tom Joyce : Well, clearly, there is some cause for concern or caution around that given some of the narrative that we heard from the channel during the course of the quarter. We saw some of that in the month of September come through in terms of the order rates on the consumable side. So, I think we feel pretty good about continuing to improve our own execution, particularly on the equipment side, also at Nobel. But I think on the consumables side, we will need to make sure that we are seeing some improvement in the sellout either from a programmatic perspective or just from an overall macroeconomic perspective. Nigel Coe : Great, okay. And then Diagnostics, we don\u2019t have a great history on the quarterly performance of Diagnostics, but it does feel like last year, we saw maybe an unusually large Q-over-Q step down in margins in 3Q followed by a pretty big pickup in 4Q. Would you expect to see a similar 4Q buildup out of 3Q? And then more broadly on 4Q restructuring across the portfolio, in the past, Danaher had the very heavy restructuring actions in 4Q, I know this year is not going to be anywhere like that, but maybe just comment on how you see 4Q restructuring actions across the portfolio? Dan Comas : Yes, Nigel. On Diagnostics first, seasonally, Q3 tends to be a little lighter, so that play out again this year, there was big improvement versus Q3 a year ago and we do expect a nice, seasonal pickup in Q4, I would expect margins above where they were a year ago Q4, which was north of 18%. Regarding restructuring, we continue to take actions throughout the year. We don\u2019t really kind of call those out. I would expect our overall restructuring spend to be in the same ballpark as last year, again probably a little bit more evenly distributed through the year. Nigel Coe : Okay, guys. Thanks a lot. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : And at this time, we would like to thank everybody for their participation on today\u2019s conference call. Please feel free to disconnect your line at anytime.",

And we finished on a strong note with our fourth quarter results. We were very pleased with how the team executed throughout the year, delivering solid core revenue growth, significant margin improvement, adjusted EPS growth of more than 20%, and outstanding free cash flow. The Danaher business system continues to be our foundation, our competitive advantage, and a key driver of our performance. You've heard us talk about running the Danaher playbook, meaning that we're consistently driving our businesses to improve gross and operating margins and lower G&A, all while reinvesting more into R&D and sales and marketing. In 2016 alone we improved both growth \u2013 gross and core operating margin by more than 100 basis points. At the same time we reduced G&A and meaningfully increased R&D and sales and marketing spend as a percent of sales. For the full year, our differentiated portfolio, investments in organic growth initiatives, and good execution helped drive 3% core revenue growth in a challenging macro environment. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now nearly $17 billion. From an M&A perspective in 2016 we closed eight acquisitions across all five platforms for nearly $5 billion, including our two largest deals, Cepheid and Phenomenex. We also completed the spinoff of Fortive, which was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio and strategically positioning Danaher for long-term outperformance. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in 2016. And our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was greater than 115%, representing the 25th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. Turning now to the fourth quarter. Sales grew 6% to $4.6 billion with core revenue increasing 3.5%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 4%. Geographically, high growth markets revenue was up high single-digits. China and India continued to lead the way, while Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia all returned to growth in part due to easier comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single-digits, led by growth in the U.S. and Western Europe. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 54.5%, an increase of 230 basis points from last year. And core operating margins were up 170 basis points. These strong margin results are a testament to our team's focused execution and helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.05, which represents an increase of 15% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.61, up over 20% from 2015. Now let's take a more detailed look at results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue was up 6% and core revenue grew 4%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 16.8%. And core operating margin increased 345 basis points. This increase was driven by great execution using DBS, particularly at Pall, where the team drove a number of meaningful operational improvements. Beckman Life Sciences core revenue grew low single digits in the quarter, led by our Flow Cytometry and Particle Counting businesses. A strong finish to the year in China was capped off by another quarter of double-digit growth in the region, while weakness persisted in Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by demand for CytoFLEX, which continued to be a meaningful contributor to share gains in our Flow Cytometry business. At Leica Microsystems, we saw incremental improvements in the quarter with core revenue up low single digits. This was largely driven by North America and China, offset by declines in Japan. SCIEX increased core revenue at a mid-single-digit rate, led by growth in China and Western Europe. SCIEX's service offering had another quarter of double-digit growth. And we saw continued strength in the food, environmental and pharmaceutical end markets, particularly within the fast-growing biopharmaceutical space. In 2016 our Life Sciences platform delivered a significant number of new products to our biopharma customers in order to improve their bio production processes. One example is at SCIEX, where we just launched the X500B, the latest model in our X-Series mass spectrometry platform. You may remember that the first model in the series, the X500R, was designed for routine food, environmental, and forensic testing labs. Now we've added the X500B, which is specifically designed for complex biologics characterization. The X500B brings simplicity and high performance to one of the most compact mass spec footprints in the market. Its ease of use makes it accessible to even novice mass spec users and helps customers get better answers faster in their bio processing work flows. During the fourth quarter we successfully closed the acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that operates in an attractive industry adjacent to where SCIEX participates. Phenomenex is off to a great start, and we're excited to have the team on board. Over at Pall, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was driven by Pall Life Sciences, where we saw continued demand across our Biopharmaceuticals business with particular strength in single-use technologies. Pall Industrial delivered positive results for the first time since the acquisition, with low-single-digit core revenue growth supported by strong execution in microelectronics and aerospace. This growth was offset by declines in our Process Technologies business. 2016 was a great year for Pall. And the team improved execution both operationally and commercially using the Danaher Business System. Pall delivered more than 400 basis points of operating margin expansion, improved on time delivery by over 1,500 basis points, and significantly increased their market visibility. By applying DBS principles to Pall's R&D initiatives, the team has been able to combine Pall's innovation prowess with greater executional focus to launch a number of new technologies ahead of schedule. In total Pall launched 35 new products this year, a 50% increase over last year. And the team was able to get these new products to market 25% faster. Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 11% and core revenue increased 3%. Core operating margins grew by 80 basis points. And reported operating margins declined to 12.6%, predominantly due to the acquisition related charges from the Cepheid transaction. For the full year Diagnostics core operating margins were up 200 basis points. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter was up low single digits in the quarter, led by our immunoassay solutions. Growth across all major geographies was led by demand in high growth markets, including double digit gains in the Middle East and China. We saw better performance in North America. And importantly the team continues to drive improvement in customer retention and win rates. Radiometer achieved high single digit core revenue growth in the quarter. We saw positive performance in all major regions, with high-growth markets led by double digit growth in Latin America and China. Both our blood gas and AQT lines performed well. And we believed Radiometer continued to gain share in 2016. At Leica Biosystems core revenue declined at low single digits with growth in Western Europe and China offset by softness in North America and the Middle East. Advanced Staining Consumables achieved double-digit growth, while we saw weakness in our core Histology and Pathology imaging product lines. In November we successfully closed the acquisition of Cepheid, a leading innovator in the fast-growing area of molecular diagnostics. Cepheid is off to a good start, delivering double digit revenue growth in the quarter. And we continue to see tremendous opportunity to deliver better top and bottom line performance over time through the application of DBS. Turning to our Dental segment. Reported and core revenues increased 50 basis points and reported operating margins decreased slightly to 15.4%. While we had solid growth across our specialty product line, including Orthodontics and Implants, this was mostly offset by continued market weakness in our traditional Dental Consumables and Equipment businesses. We anticipate that these more challenging market conditions will persist into the early part of 2017. We've mentioned before that we're approaching the entire Dental platform as a new acquisition. And despite the recent market weakness, we're encouraged by the early results. In 2016 the team improved core revenue growth, added over 75 basis points of gross margin, and increased core operating margins by 90 basis points. We also lowered our G&A costs by 50 basis points, which was helped in part by a 30% reduction of our manufacturing and back office footprint. By improving the cost structure we facilitated greater investment back into the business to drive growth. We increased R&D spend by approximately 10% to reinvigorate new product development. And our investments and go-to-market initiatives are up 5% year on year to help improve our commercial execution. So overall, we feel very well positioned with our Dental portfolio and remain focused on enhancing our foundation for long term growth. Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 3.5%, with core revenue up 4%. Good execution by the team generated 210 basis points in core operating margin expansion. And reported operating margin increased to 24%. In Product Identification core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. This growth was led by strong demand for marketing and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our Packaging and Color Solutions was led by positive momentum in both North and Latin America. Videojet closed out a great year on a strong note, delivering high single digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The business grew across all major product lines and geographies with particular strength in North America, Western Europe, and Latin America. Videojet also achieved another quarter of double digit service growth. And we believe that we continued to gain share relative to the market. With over 15 years of experience applying the Danaher Business System, Videojet continues to utilize DBS to drive improvements across the business. By applying DBS to drive disciplined marketing, R&D, and service growth initiatives, Videojet has achieved mid-single digit core revenue growth or better in each of the last seven years, while meaningfully expanding margins. The Videojet team continues to set a tremendous example of how we can continuously sharpen our competitive advantage with DBS. At Esko core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate on strength in both North and Latin America. While at X-Rite, core revenue was up low single digits, driven by good performance in Pantone's Color Standards business. Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single digit rate. At Hach, low single digit core revenue growth was supported by modest improvements in municipal and industrial performance in the U.S., partially offset by sluggish project activity in Eastern Europe. We are, however, encouraged by mid-single digit bookings growth in the quarter, as we saw improving order trends in both the U.S. and Western Europe. Earlier in the year, Hach launched the TU5 series turbidity meters, an innovative new technology that dramatically improves water quality testing for customers. A first in the industry, the TU5 series uses the same new detection technology in both online and lab instruments to deliver fast, accurate measurements that consistently match. This is important, as it now provides drinking water professionals with identical online and lab results, giving them superior confidence that they deliver clean, safe drinking water to their communities. This successful launch of the TU5 series has been driven by Hach's highly effective new product commercialization process and is also a great example of how Hach continues to deliver breakthrough innovation to our customers. During the fourth quarter, Trojan increased core revenue at a low single digit rate off a tough prior-year comparison. Trojan had very strong performance in 2016, achieving high single digit core revenue growth for the second consecutive year, helped by continued demand in the municipal disinfection end markets in both the U.S. and Western Europe. And finally at ChemTreat, core revenue grew at a high single digit rate during the quarter, as the team continued to gain share relative to the market. Strength in both North and Latin America benefited from improved conditions in certain industrial end markets, including mining and steel. It's worth noting that in 2016 we marked ChemTreat's 49th consecutive year of growth, a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's commitment to DBS and their best-in-class commercial execution. So to wrap up. We're very pleased with our strong fourth quarter results, capping off a transformative year for Danaher. In 2016 the team delivered double digit earnings growth, meaningful margin expansion, and strong free cash flow. We also executed on a number of strategically significant acquisitions during the year, including Cepheid and Phenomenex. We believe that the strength of our portfolio combined with the power of DBS provides the foundation for enhancing our growth trajectory and delivering long-term outperformance. We're initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.82 and $0.85. This assumes core revenue growth of approximately 3%, which is modestly impacted by one less selling day year on year in the first quarter. As we announced at our annual investor event in December, we continue to expect full year 2017 core revenue growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95. Matthew E. Gugino - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Roxanna, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Morning, Scott. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Dental is kind of a business that seems to come in and out of favor for you guys every couple years and problems here and there and good times, bad times. But I know it's a global business, so it's hard to isolate exactly. But would you always \u2013 I mean when you think about fixing it \u2013 \"fixing it,\" it's still a pretty darn good business. But is it more of a product fix? A channel fix? A cost fix? I mean how do you \u2013 and how is it \u2013 how difficult is it? I mean just give us a sense. Because I feel like I've heard this fix Dental speech a few times before in the Danaher history. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure, Scott. Thanks for the question. My history with the Dental platform is about I guess 2.5 years old. And as far as favor goes, I've long been in favor, at least in the last 2.5 years, of the Dental platform, largely because I think it has tremendous opportunities. I think it has such fundamental growth drivers on a global basis. And I think our performance over a number of years has not been up to our capabilities. In other words I think we have a tremendous opportunity to improve both the growth trajectory and the margin performance of the platform. So I'm very much \u2013 I'm very favorably disposed towards the platform, both from the standpoint of the fundamentals of the market on a global basis as well as the opportunity that it represents. Relative to what we have been doing and will continue to do and the challenges associated with it. I think it started with that approach that I mentioned both in December as well as on this call, about thinking about it as a new acquisition, essentially taking a new approach. You might say a somewhat more radical approach. In other words when we approach a newly acquired business, we tend to not approach it through small, incremental improvements. You look at what we've done at Beckman, you look at what we've most recently done at Pall, and you see much more significant amount of activity around DBS. A much more significant infusion of talent and as a result of that, more significant levels of improvement. You asked about product, channel, cost, et cetera. I would really go back to this comment I made about running the Danaher playbook. It does involve cost. It does involve rationalizing a number of dimensions of the platform that has an impact on the cost structure. It involves rationalizing the manufacturing footprint, the instrumentation and equipment platforms, the brands, even the operating structure from a people perspective. But the playbook then has that cost not all dropping to the bottom line. You've seen good operating performance this year. But it really involves reinvesting some of that back into the business to drive growth. And I think what the team has done so successfully in the last year is both drive that operating margin performance up and reinvest with, as you heard me comment, 5% to 10% increases in R&D and sales and marketing to get the growth engine moving. And so I think it's going to take some time. But I think we're on the right track. Again I think the fundamentals are solid and the room for operating improvements are significant. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good answer. Just a real quick follow-up. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: How do you do M&A when you don't really know the tax rate of what you're buying? Is that something right now you kind of put back on hold till you have more clarity on tax? Or is it not as important as maybe we think? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Well, Scott, given all the various proposals out there, it is a little bit of an unknown. But the two or three sort of leading candidates of a new potential structure based upon the analysis we've done would all suggest it would be neutral to positive to us. So I don't think there's a structure out there at least that's high on the list right now that would be a negative for us. And that would worry me a little bit from an M&A perspective, but I don't think that's the case. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey. Thanks, guys. Just while \u2013 before we go to the next question, Roxanna, I just want to make one other point on the back of Scott's question about the Dental platform. I think if you step back for a second. I know we get a lot of questions about the Dental platform. I think it's important to recognize that the Dental platform does represent about 15% of the corporation. And there are a number of businesses inside of that platform, like our Implant business and our Orthodontics platform that continue to perform quite well. And you've got the other 85% of the platform that from a core growth perspective is well on its way and I think is performing quite well. So I think it's also important to put the Dental platform in context, relative to the scale of it within the corporation. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair point. Thank you, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Tom, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on some of the areas where you saw an improvement on the industrial side. You talked about Pall picking up low single digit core revenue growth. Can you maybe just talk about what the order book looks like and expectations for 2017? And similarly with Hach, you talked about mid-single digit bookings. So what's the outlook there? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Tycho. Good morning. We were encouraged somewhat by what we saw, I would say in the latter part of the fourth quarter and certainly in December on the industrial side. Pall Industrial clearly being one of those, our first quarter of positive core growth certainly since \u2013 in some time and since we've owned the business. So we're particularly encouraged by that. Water Quality, while that's been somewhat challenged from an industrial perspective during the course of the year, we saw some improvement there in the fourth quarter. Our PID business, which it's admittedly not as industrially oriented as perhaps Pall Industrial is, clearly seeing some excellent performance there. And then finally I think our Life Science business, which has some industrial exposure, particularly at Leica Microsystems, to name one example, also showing some improvement. So I think we're not really ready to call an inflection point, Tycho, but I think there are some signs in the order book that I think are encouraging. Relative to expectations in the first quarter, again not calling an inflection point, but I think we would expect some similar performance in the first quarter to what we saw in the fourth quarter, not a dramatic change. The 3% core growth overall that we have dialed in in the first quarter implies a level of consistency there. A little bit of an impact of days that dampen the numbers slightly. But in general I think we would expect some stabilization in the industrial markets that we saw late in the fourth quarter to continue into the first. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then for a follow-up just a clarification on Dental. You mentioned in your comments you thought Dental softness would persist in early 2017. What gives you confidence that things improve in the back half of the year? And is there a distributor work down dynamic? We've heard about that from a number of your peers as well. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Relative to the last part of the question. I think the commentary around sell-out from distribution, and you heard that commentary earlier in the middle part of the year, the third quarter in the year. We saw the impact of that in terms of our sell-in, certainly in the fourth quarter in the more traditional consumables and equipment. I think that's giving the channel some \u2013 setting a tone of caution if you will. And so when you have caution that comes from some moderating sell-out, it's going to have some impact there. They're going to do some, what I think is probably some right-sizing of inventory in the channel with an abundance of caution before they start to see sell-out improve. So I think \u2013 when we think about the fundamentals of the market, it's hard to see, Tycho, or pinpoint any particular reasons why we wouldn't see the traditional consumables and equipment start to pick up a bit as the year progresses. I couldn't tell you much more than that, other than the fact that we've not seen these types of air pockets if you will persist over a long period of time. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Tycho. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, could you maybe talk about within Pall, you continue to ratch up very good numbers. So how is it looking relative to that original $300 million synergy guide? Where are you on your thinking on that? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: We feel very good about that, Steve. We got off to a fast start and an early start. We got that rate north of the $60 million that we talked about for the first year to more like $100 million. And I think that's really a function of the impact of the team in place, both the legacy Pall team as well as the Danaher team that went in to help out. It's a function of the impact of DBS and the over 300 kaizens that we got after. And so I think we feel great about our opportunities to get to that $300 million target. I think as we look forward and you've heard us say from the very beginning that some of the more challenging tens of millions of dollars in that run rate are going to come in the latter periods as we work on some of the more challenging dimensions of the supply chain, the manufacturing footprint. And so I think as we think about the timeframe, I think the overall timeframe of achieving that kind of rate in the four- to five-year period is still the numbers that we'd hang onto, only given the fact that it's just a little bit more challenging each year to affect those changes in the supply chain and the manufacturing footprint. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: If $100 million was achieved in 2016, what's embedded in your forecast for 2017? Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Our sort of \u2013 and we originally planned roughly $60 million a year over that five-year period. We would expect to be in that $60 million plus range this year. So by the end of 2017, we will still be ahead of \u2013 we would expect to still be ahead of our original schedule. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on the SG&A, how much of that 110 basis points was G&A versus sales increase? Year on year? Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: The G&A was down. Sales and marketing was up overall as a percentage. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys. Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Oh and then \u2013 you mean in the fourth quarter? Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Yeah. A fair amount of that is noise in Cepheid. But organically, G&A \u2013 excluding Cepheid, organically G&A was down and sales and marketing was up as a percent of revenues. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Co. Please go ahead. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is actually Chris Lin on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my questions. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Chris. No problem. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just a first \u2013 just a question on Cepheid first. It appears that on a full calendar Q4 basis it grew 15% to 20% year over year in Q4? Is this right? And then can you just provide some commentary on the key drivers to the strong performance in the quarter by test category? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. We did grow in that range during the course of the fourth quarter. So you do have that right. And when we think about the growth of the business, the growth has been very consistent. We continue to see the hospital acquired infection business, which is a large part of the business, continue to perform well and pretty consistently. We continue to see good growth in infectious disease, in sexual health, and in virology. So when you think about the individual product segments of the business, we've seen a good deal of consistency in terms of those growth rates across the four I just mentioned. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. On then just on a higher level, could you just provide some updated thoughts on how the Cepheid integration is progressing? And how you are initially leveraging DBS at Cepheid? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. So it's early days obviously. We just closed the transaction in November. We have an outstanding team of people leading the Cepheid business, largely the Cepheid associates, but with the addition of some key Danaher associates as well, which has been consistent with how we've approached organizations newly acquired in the past. The team has quickly embraced a number of the tools of the Danaher Business System. Dan and I were out at Cepheid just a couple of weeks ago, out in Sunnyvale. We had an operating review out there. And we toured the manufacturing facility and met with one of the R&D teams as well. I was incredibly impressed by what I saw on the shop floor, the before and the after impacts of the use of kaizen on the shop floor. Five-day kaizens that involved Danaher teams combined with Cepheid teams that were making improvements on the shop floor. The tools of DBS that impact new product development were clearly on display when I met with the Omni (35:22) team and saw the impact of what they were working on and the kaizen there. So I think the team is off to a very good start. I think they're off to a fast start, given that we're just about two months post the close of the acquisition. So we're very pleased with how things have gotten started, Chris. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Just focusing in on sort of the Pharma market. Obviously you provided us a bunch of color, but it seemed like results there reasonably strong relative to the trend we've seen. And obviously bioprocess continues to be a standout. As you sort of enter 2017 with all of the sort of noise around drug pricing and maybe some of the headline issues that have happened on the pipeline side, do you see any disruption to that market whatsoever? And I guess can you tease out whether it differs in terms of CapEx versus some of the more consumable items? If there's any differential in growth rates? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Ross. So, Ross, let's maybe just \u2013 to answer your question let's take a step back for a second and try to put a context around our position in Pharma. So our pharma exposure is say between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in overall revenue. The largest segment of our exposure, the segment where we're most largely exposed, is Biopharma. And we're seeing high single digit growth in those areas where we're exposed to Biopharma. The largest segment of that is in the production side of Biopharma. So call that $1 billion of that revenue. And that's largely at Pall in Biopharma production, which we expect will continue to be a terrific growth market. That's really driven, as you probably know well, by the growth in Biopharmaceutical, drug production itself. And the pipeline today is a rich pipeline. It's never been bigger than it is it today in terms of the number of drugs that are \u2013 the large molecule drugs that are currently in development. And we also see single use technologies in biosimilars being key drivers of growth over time. So we feel very good about that. In terms of drug discovery, so outside of production, call that about $0.5 billion worth of exposure. And that's where SCIEX and Beck LS [Beckman Life Sciences] and Molecular Devices participate. We continue to do well in those businesses; no real slow down. We think we've got some terrific products that are highly differentiated. And so when it comes to large molecule drug discovery, we continue to see again, based on the pipelines and the continued investment in those drugs versus small molecules, that those to be great opportunities. And then finally, we have some positions in small molecule pharma. That would be at SCIEX and in a couple of other places. And there's still some excellent revenue growth there, but probably not as significant as we see on the Biopharma side. So we feel very good about those markets, largely as a function of where Pharma is investing today and is likely to invest consistently in the future. Just going back though for a second to the largest portion of that, that $1 billion dollars or so in Biopharma production at Pall. I think the key thing to recognize is that filtration plays an incredibly valuable role in that bio production process. And yet on a relative basis is a fairly low cost component of that overall production process. So we love businesses where we deliver high quality, high value consumables that are relatively low cost relative to the overall production process or the workflow. And so that creates an incredibly strategically important position for us and one that we think is quite sustainable over time. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : That's super helpful, Tom. And maybe just quickly, Dan, sequentially interest expense ticked down quite a bit, probably more than certainly I and maybe others modeled. Just is this the new base? Or was there something with sort of the mix or favorability in some of the rates you got on financing Cepheid, et cetera? What's the explanation? And then the cadence off of that? Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Part of it is very attractive rates, particularly in Europe where our commercial paper program is essentially 0% right now. In some cases we're actually getting paid for borrowing money in Europe. I think we're thinking about roughly $40 million a quarter going into next year as a run rate. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Ross. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Please go ahead. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : I guess I got to go borrow some money in Europe apparently. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: If we're having a tough quarter, we're just going to borrow more. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Tom. On Videojet I mean you talked about the long track record of core growth there. I mean what is it that Videojet has gotten right so consistently over so many years that other businesses that you have that are in arguably maybe even higher growth end markets haven't been able to consistently translate? What's the gap that you're trying to close there with the other businesses? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Yeah. Shannon, that business and the team that has led that business for a long period of time now has really created what we sometimes refer to at Danaher as a flywheel, a combination of initiatives that continue to build momentum over time and do so on a very consistent and continuous basis. You heard me mention the great core growth and the long track record. It's really those initiatives are a combination of things. It starts with day to day execution using the tools of DBS without question. The Videojet was really the birth place of a number of key tools that we now use throughout Danaher around day to day commercial execution. We call those tools transformative marketing, under a broad heading of transformative marketing. And it really involves outstanding market visibility, tailored messaging, and outstanding communication to targeted end customers and tremendous field sales follow-up, backed up by an exceptional service organization, which as you heard me say is growing double digits. That flywheel of commercial execution is now accelerating based on terrific innovation. The team would tell you today they probably have the most exciting line-ups of new products that they've ever had in their history. Some of those products are already in the market today and just getting commercialized. And you see some of the impact in the recent quarters of core growth. And others are coming. The team would say it's the best line-up in probably 15 years. And they continue to invest, frankly, in some areas where there's still opportunities commercially, like in high growth markets. They've done some acquisitions of distributors recently. They've added feet on the street in a number of markets. And they would quickly say that there's still opportunities to improve growth in a couple of those high growth markets where perhaps they haven't put the playbook to work as consistently as they would have liked. So it truly is a combination of things. It's a tribute to the team. It's a tribute to DBS. And it really is something that we're very proud of. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just on the core margin improvement for the year across the company, clearly really strong and above what you would typically target. How much of that do you attribute to a deal like Pall that's getting after some extra margin initially versus more mature pieces of the portfolio that are just beating their plan? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Shannon, it really was an exceptionally strong year and very broad-based in terms of core margin expansion. But Pall was a meaningful contributor. But Diagnostics up 200 basis points for the year, almost 100 basis points at Dental despite a very sort of tepid end market, particularly in the second half. So really good execution. And I think what was most noteworthy this year was the increase in the gross margin side. That was all organic. For the full year it was driven by new products, as Tom alluded to, in the PID side, as an example. Coming up with new products at higher gross margins, really good execution in the factory, really taking advantage of our purchasing leverage. And that 100 basis points of gross margins obviously both fell through to the operating margin side but also let us really step up some R&D and sales and marketing investments across a number of the businesses. So that's a number we watch very carefully and our execution on that was as good as it's been in 2016. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Shannon. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Good morning. Hey, just one more quick one on Dental if I could. Could you just provide us a little more color on how to think about Dental margins? How they play out in 2017, as we kind of work through these cross-currents of restructuring actions and associated payback you hope to get from them? And anything to be kind of aware of, first half versus second half, et cetera, as that plays out? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Jeff, for the full year I would expect a kind of similar dynamic that we saw in 2016, which was kind of low single digit or very low single digit organic growth, but still churning out 75 basis points of core margin expansion. It's perhaps a little bit less than that in the first half, because we are sort of continually taking some cost action. You might see a little bit more of that in the first half. But again I think we can kind of cover elsewhere. But I think for the full year, we'd like to see a little bit of pick up on the top line. But even if we don't I think we could replicate what we did in 2016. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. And then I just wonder if you could give us a little more color on China. It sounds like things were better in a few of your businesses. Do you think there's some legitimate kind of economic traction starting to happen there? Or are there comp issues? Just your bigger picture on China right now. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Jeff, we continue to perform very well in China. I think a couple of businesses that I'd highlight would be the \u2013 our Dental business that continues to deliver terrific double digit core growth in China. And that's a broad-based growth rate across all the product lines of Dental. We've got a terrific team over there. We continue to invest in feet on the street. And the overall fundamentals of the Dental market in China continue to suggest that's going to be a terrific growth driver for us. Our Diagnostic business has also continued to perform very well there. We're seeing good growth in that business. We have at Beckman Diagnostics for a long period of time. Our Radiometer business continuing to perform well. And Leica Biosystems is now developing products in China for China. So a more localized approach to ensuring that we're hitting the right kind of price points in that market. I think on the flip side, looking at where there's been some challenges, I think where we've had a little bit more industrial exposure in China, there have been some challenges. I think Water Quality, to name one, is an area where we've seen some challenges, given the slowdown in the industrial market. So we're expecting to see a little bit of a pickup there as we come into 2017 across the industrial markets. But that's really been where the softness has been is the more industrial exposure we had, the lower the growth rates in China. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Derik. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : A couple of quick housekeeping questions, then a follow-up. So the housekeeping \u2013 and if I missed it I apologize. The FX guidance, what's embedded for FX into Q1 and for your full year guidance? And also the free cash flow guide for fiscal 2017? Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Sure. For the full year what we highlighted in December when the euro was $1.06 \u2013 and I think it's $1.07 \u2013 is about $0.08 negative year-on-year impact, a little bit less in Q4 and pretty much evenly \u2013 the other $0.07 roughly evenly distributed among the first three quarters. And then free cash flow, we don't give out specific guidance. We again ended very strong, full-year conversion. It was a little bit lighter in Q4. That was primarily driven by the timing of some tax payments, including some kind of one-time payments related to separation that we had highlighted when we announced the separation of Fortive that we ended up paying in the fourth quarter. We would expect a very \u2013 again very strong free cash flow conversion in 2017. Maybe even a little bit better, because of some of the one-time items we had in 2016. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And more of a \u2013 more just a theoretical question. We've been getting this from investors, but I think there's some concern about if the trade issues sort of escalate and we go into some sort of a trade war with China. I guess the question becomes \u2013 is like are Diagnostic products and some of things that are so critical into those markets less subject to some of the bans and like that? And do you have any historical precedence in terms of how we could think about potential trade conflicts in some of your products? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Derik, I don't know that any of us here could speak to \u2013 sorry \u2013 a historical precedent relative to what we might be facing. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. All right. Fair enough. Fair enough. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: But I think there is an important point. Let me \u2013 all kidding aside, our positions in China and let's \u2013 I think you were asking maybe a bit about the Diagnostic business. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Our business in China, we have manufacturing in China for China. I just mentioned LBS (50:31) just a minute ago, now designing products, manufacturing products for the Chinese market. We do $2 billion roughly in revenue in China. And so that's really the core of our China business. When we went to China years ago, we went less for the purposes of low-cost manufacturing, more for purposes of being a local player. And I think that's key to our strategy. So I think in that respect, I'm probably a little bit less worried about the impact on us specifically relative to China-related tariffs. Time will tell, obviously. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Derik. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions here. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure, Steve. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: One very broad question and then one more specific question. The very broad question, maybe taking the concept that Derik introduced with the question around China trade, let's think about it more broadly. We're in a period here where not just Danaher, but Danaher's customer base is thinking about an array of different potential policy changes in Washington. Are there areas where you're hearing from your customer base? Any incremental animal spirits or conservatism that we should think about as we consider trends in the business into 2017? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Steve, I think one of the terrific advantages that we have at Danaher in this portfolio is being a multi-industry science and technology portfolio. And what that means is that we don't have any particularly significant exposure to one end market or one customer set in one geography versus \u2013 relative to the whole. Specific to your question, I would say no. We have not sensed \u2013 I think what you asked about is animal spirits or animal instincts in any way. But I think you ought to use the term conservatism. And I think certainly there probably are some pockets of end markets today where there's probably some conservatism. I think there were a couple pockets of our Diagnostic businesses where we sensed that there could have been a little bit of conservatism in the fourth quarter perhaps, as people were a little bit uncertain about what the future would be of ACA. That's again something that's rather nuanced and somewhat speculative on the end markets' part. But I think there's so much uncertainty in the world today that there must be pockets of conservatism in some places. But we are not hearing anything consistent or at a particularly \u2013 at a high-volume level from customers that would diminish our view of the end markets. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then so if I take a step back and look at Diagnostics, which was my follow-up question. If I look at results in the quarter, considering the comp, I look at the Abbott results, I look at the Thermo [Fisher] results, and a couple of the smaller players, it does look like things across the Diagnostics channel in the fourth quarter might have been a little bit lighter. Safe to say your view right now is that that's a function of just a little bit of a pause? And what are we looking for to call any recovery there? Thanks so much. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. You bet, Steve. Again, Steve, there could have been some conservatism due to uncertainty in the market. But we were very pleased with actually our performance in Diagnostics in the quarter, and particularly at Beckman Diagnostics, where we saw some improved performance. We're seeing continued progress in customer retention and new customer win rates. We see continued outstanding performance from Radiometer on a broad basis with high single digit growth rates. And probably the only weak spot that we saw was at Leica Biosystems. However in the case of Leica Biosystems, they had an incredibly strong third quarter. And so a bit of a difficult back-to-back quarter situation and a bit of a challenging comp perhaps. So we feel pretty good about where we sit in Diagnostics and continued good performance. So some conservatism out there? Maybe. Some uncertainty? Without a doubt. But we'll continue to play offense. And we feel pretty good about where we are. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Tom. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, we've covered a lot of ground here. I did want to address, there's a lot of intrigue in the industrials regarding the pending sale of GE Water. And I know you can't be specific, but might there be any particular business that would be coming out of GE Water that might fit with Danaher's Water Quality platform? And then just a related question is one of the issues that GE struggled with is trying to manage both a Membrane business and a Chemical business. In many ways those are diametrically opposed. But you all have done this successfully. So what has been part of your secret sauce in being able to have both those technologies within one platform? Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Deane. And you're right, we don't comment on any specific transactions. And yeah, it's certainly public knowledge about what's going on at GE Water. And it's certainly fair to say that we look at and consider everything that might be available. Deane, you've come to know and hopefully love our Water Quality position over a number of years. And so I think you know well, we really have a bias towards high margin, lower ticket instrumentation and consumables. Sort of goes along with what I was talking about earlier when I was talking about the Pall Filtration business, high value products that contribute meaningfully to workflows, particularly regulated workflows, and that's terrific recurring revenue streams. And that means that we're not as favorably disposed towards large infrastructure or lower gross margin businesses that might also bring along lower growth rates. So I think to your question about our success to this point in having different types of businesses in the same platform, I think the key to that, Deane, has been keeping those businesses that are quite different from one another separate and distinct in their organization structures. ChemTreat today exists in the same organization structure as an independent, truly autonomous operating company, as much so as the day we bought it. Our Pall Water business that came along with the overall Pall acquisition by the way has now been moved into Hach, but is set up as a separating \u2013 separated business unit from the rest of the business. And so that focus on the end markets with a unique operating structure that's distinct from others in the platform is really key to maintaining the consistency and performance of those businesses. So we like where we are. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's real helpful. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Deane. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.",

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re off to a good start in 2017. During the first quarter, our two most recent, larger acquisitions Pall and Cepheid, performed very well. We drove share gains in a number of our operating companies and achieved high-single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We also continued to reinvest in our businesses to enhance our long-term growth trajectory, and we feel well-positioned to benefit from compelling market drivers across the portfolio. Today, you will hear a number of examples of how our focus on innovation and key commercial initiatives enable us to provide customers with new technologies and solutions that they need to improve critical processes. By prioritizing this targeted reinvestment, we believe that we can strengthen our competitive advantage and better position our portfolio for sustainable long-term outperformance. Turning to our first quarter results. Sales increased 7% to $4.2 billion and core revenue grew 2.5%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 6%. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up low single digits. High growth markets grew at a mid single digit rate led by continued strength in China and India. Gross margin for the first quarter was 55.5%, an increase of 30 basis points from last year. Our core operating margin declined 15 basis points, and reported operating margin declined 80 basis points to 14.8%. These declines were primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions, incremental growth investments and the impact of foreign exchange rates. In terms of M&A, we announced two acquisitions for nearly a $100 million, both of which are subject to customary closing conditions and are expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. As we move through the year, we will continue to focus primarily on small and midsized acquisitions. First quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $0.85, which represents an increase of 8% over last year. Now, let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our performance across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue was up 4% and core revenue grew 3%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 16.2%. And core operating margin increased 165 basis points. This strong margin improvement was broad-based across the platform including Pall and is reflective of the team executing well using DBS. At Beckman Life Sciences, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate. Ongoing strength in our Flow Cytometry and Particle Counting businesses was modestly offset by declines in certification [ph]. Developed markets was slightly softer mainly due to the timing of certain projects, while strong momentum continued in China where local investment in research and biopharma drove another quarter of sustained growth in the region. Beckman reinforced its commitment to innovation during the quarter with the launch of the Biomek i-Series automated workstations. This new automated liquid handling platform provides consistent sample preparation with greater efficiency, adaptability and reliability. The Biomek i-Series launch is the combination of a focused R&D process, which included obtaining extensive voice of the customer and during which the team worked with end users around the world to identify vital features for a new platform. One of our five core values at Danaher is customers talk, we listen. And by better understanding our customers Beckman was able to deliver market-driven innovation and ensure that new products like the Biomek i-Series will provide critical solutions for scientists\u2019 evolving needs. Core revenue at SCIEX was up low-single-digits, driven by growth in Western Europe and China. We saw good demand in the pharmaceutical end market across all major geographies with particular strength in China where tightened regulations around generic drug production are generating greater demand for testing. Leica Microsystems delivered high-single-digit revenue growth as all major regions and product lines showed positive performance. North America and Western Europe were driven by several key project wins, particularly in our confocal and surgical businesses. Pall\u2019s call revenue grew low-single-digits with mid-single-digit growth at Pall Life Sciences led by gain across our biopharmaceutical business, particularly in single use technologies. Pall Industrial\u2019s core revenue was down slightly versus the tough prior year comparison. This was largely the result of a sizeable project in the Middle East in the first half of 2016. Our microelectronics and aerospace businesses continue to perform very well. We saw signs of stabilization across a number of our industrial and process end-markets. We were also encouraged by strong bookings throughout the quarter. We\u2019re well-positioned in our biopharma business and expect we will continue to benefit from the long-term trends in this end market, including the shift from small to large molecule drugs and the increasing proliferation of single use technologies across biopharma production processes. A great example of Pall\u2019s leadership in this space was on display of the INTERPHEX biomanufacturing trade show in March where we featured a number of recent innovations like the BioSMB continuous chromatography system and the Cadence Acoustic Separator, which are helping customers improve the efficiency of their bio-production workflows. Turning now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 17% and core revenue increased 2.5%. Reported operating margins declined to 11.6%, in part due to recent acquisitions. Core operating margins decreased 240 basis points and were negatively impacted by the strengthening of both the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus other currencies along with incremental growth investments in R&D, service and commercial initiatives. Radiometer\u2019s core revenue grew high-single-digits with positive results across all major geographies. Our blood gas and AQT product lines continued to perform well and double-digit instrument sales helped to expand Radiometer\u2019s installed base and drive strong recurring revenue growth. At Leica Biosystems, core revenue increased at a low-single-digit rate, led by growth in the developed markets and China. Advanced staining performed very well across both instruments and consumables while our core histology and tissue acquisition product lines declined. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter was up low single digits, with strength in high growth markets, partially offset by weakness in Western Europe and North America. Our business in China delivered another strong quarter as meaningful install based expansion in the region contributed to healthy recurring revenue growth. Cepheid is off to a great start and achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Through the thoughtful application of DBS, the team has implemented numerous process improvements to increase productivity since acquisition. These initiatives have already generated meaningful operating margin expansion and we are very encouraged by this early progress. Cepheid also received FDA clearance for its Xpert Xpress flu and RSV respiratory virus test in March. Both of these tests deliver molecular results in as little as 20 minutes, twice as fast as their predecessors and with comparable accuracy. The first 24 hours of flu and RSV symptom onset is a critical window and the Xpress test\u2019s faster turnaround time enables clinicians to access reliable diagnoses and targeted therapies for the patients that much more quickly. Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported and core revenue growth was roughly flat in the first quarter. Core operating margin declined 85 basis points and reported operating margin decreased to 13.6%. This margin decline was largely driven by weakness in our higher margin traditional consumables business. Solid demand continued for our specialty product lines including orthodontics and implants, and we saw positive growth in our equipment business. We anticipate the weakness across our traditional consumables business will persist in the near-term, leading to similar growth rates in Q2 as we saw in Q1 for the overall Dental platform. In the meantime, we remain focused on enhancing our dental portfolio\u2019s foundation for long-term growth. Recent cost structure improvements have facilitated reinvestment in the business to drive growth through commercial initiatives and through innovation. At the International Dental Show in March, we featured more than 10 new products from across our dental platform, including the SMARTmatic handpiece campaign, KaVo OP 3D Pro panoramic X-Ray imaging system. We also featured DTX Studio, a single digital software platform that connects a dental office across its entire workflow from diagnosis to design and patient treatment. These innovative technologies enable an entire Dental team to work more effectively and most importantly support better treatment outcomes for patients. Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Both reported core revenue were up 4.5%, reported margins were 22.7% with core operating margins up 60 basis points due to broad based DBS execution across the segment. In Product Identification, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate, driven by positive momentum in our marking and coding equipment and related consumables businesses across all major geographies. We also saw increased demand for our Packaging and Color Solutions products. In March, we announced the acquisition of Advanced Vision Technology over AVT, a leader in automatic print inspection, process control and quality assurance with over 7,000 systems installed at customer sites worldwide. AVT\u2019s in-line print inspection systems are used by the world\u2019s top packaging and label convertors to improve product quality and operational efficiency, and the business is highly complementary to X-Rite\u2019s color inspection capabilities and Esko\u2019s packaging work flow. We believe that this combination of solutions will enable us to better serve our customers by simplifying their management of complex packaging value chains. And we look forward to welcoming the AVT team to Danaher. Videojet continued to outperform in the quarter, delivering mid-single digit core revenue growth as the business grew across all product lines and most major geographies. Videojet\u2019s service offering delivered another great quarter, and the team\u2019s focus on lifecycle service initiatives continues to enhance customers\u2019 experience with greater productivity and more uptime to help reduce their operating costs. The application of DBS to Videojet\u2019s equipment sales and service approach continues to drive higher service contract attachment rates at both existing and new accounts. Core revenue at both Esko and X-Rite was up low single digits and a number of new products we introduced at the Drubish [ph] trade show last summer had gained good traction in the market.  Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a mid single digit rate. Throughout the first quarter, we were encouraged by improved momentum across our more industrial oriented businesses and we believe that we continue to gain share relative to the market across the entire platform. At Hach, mid single digit core revenue growth was supported by growth in North America and Western Europe off improving order trends that we started to see through the end of last year. In the high growth markets, China performed well, while Latin America and the Middle East declined. Solid growth across most across major product lines was led by instrument sales as we expanded our install based. For decades, Hach has pioneered in advanced coring analysis for municipal and industrial water treatment. The team continued to build on a long tradition of innovation and new product development with the recent announcement of the CM130 coring monitoring system, the first of its kind cleared by the FDA for use in the medical field. The CM130 automatically tests coring levels at dialysis centers every 5 to 20 minutes, providing frequent analysis and immediate notification of high coring [ph] events via remote indicators in the patient treatment area. It was developed in collaboration with one of the leading dialysis providers in the U.S. and is a tremendous example of Hach partners with customers to deliver connected instruments that provide actionable insights and decision support. In our water treatment businesses, both for Trojan and ChemTreat achieved mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Growth at Trojan was driven by key project wins in Western Europe, Asia and Latin America. And ChemTreat\u2019s growth was led by gains in both North -- and Latin America, which were largely driven by incremental improvements in the oil and gas sector. So, to wrap up. This is a good star to the year. Pall and Cepheid both performed well, we drove share gains at a number of our operating companies and we continued to reinvest in our businesses in order to enhance our portfolio\u2019s growth trajectory. There are compelling secular market drivers across each of our five platforms, and we feel very well-positioned to take advantage of these going forward. At the same time, we see tremendous opportunities to enhance our growth and margin profile through focused execution across the portfolio. And with the Danaher Business System continuing to serve as our foundation, we believe that we\u2019ll be able deliver long-term outperformance for shareholders. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.95 and $0.98, which assumes second quarter core revenue growth comparable to the first quarter of 2017. We continue to expect full-year 2017 adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Tracey, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : Maybe I\u2019m a little dense. But, can you help walk through the diagnostic core margin delta? So, it\u2019s down 240 basis points and you said some of that is currency. Can you help us understand how much of that is currency? Tom Joyce : Well, we know you\u2019re not dense. So, let\u2019s start with that [multiple speakers]. And it\u2019s early. Scott, starting with FX impact, which is in the neighborhood of a 100 basis points of the impact year-on-year, really has virtually everything to do with the year-on-year strengthening of both the U.S. dollar and the yen, especially the yen through the first quarter. If you think about our diagnostic business, we manufacture a great deal of our products in the U.S. and in Japan, particularly at Beckman Diagnostics. But with revenue spread as globally as it is, the high cost impact, the impact of that currency, given the strengthening of both those currencies had an impact on that ratio between where our cost structure is from a manufacturing standpoint and where those revenues are ultimately translated. So, that\u2019s the core, the FX impact. In addition to that, obviously growth was a little softer that largely came through in March, somewhat Beck DX in North America certainly and little bit of like a biosystems in the high growth markets. So, the slightly lighter core growth in a business that has a high level of recurring revenue certainly had an impact, and we\u2019re probably talking about in the neighborhood of 75 basis points of impact there. And then, we did have a little bit of a mix at Beck DX with a couple of larger automation related deals shipped in the first quarter. And when we have a high level of automation equipment associated with both those projects that tends to be a little bit of a margin headwind that\u2019s ultimately over time good news for us. When we sell automation with the equipment that automation gets bolted to the floor and that becomes an outstanding long-term account situation, because obviously it\u2019s a very sticky situation when you have that much equipment wired to an automation line, running high volume recurring revenues. So, those are the major components there, Scott. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful. Scott Davis : Yes. Nowadays, it sounds like some timing issues there. So, okay, I probably ask this question in multiple quarters but on Dental, do you have a sense of what there was a inventory destock at the distributor level or whether the end markets just soft or is there any price pressure there? I mean, how do you -- I m just trying to reconcile flat revenues and down margins when taking costs out of the business. Tom Joyce : Well, we have a little bit of both the major factors that you\u2019d point to at the outset there. Definitely, you have some softness in the end market; that phenomena began in the latter part of second half of last year and we think it continued here in the first quarter. But, when you have that phenomenon, obviously the channel becomes that much more concerned about inventory levels and is going to try to bring down inventory levels, commensurate with how they think that end market as a sell-through is happening. So, you have a combination of both those factors that to some extent from a manufacture perspective, compound themselves somewhat. The phenomenon is generally oriented towards the North American market, a little bit in Europe but more North American in terms of its impact and it\u2019s primarily around the traditional consumables market. And so, when you have that impact obviously on the consumables end of our portfolio, that\u2019s where significant impact comes through on the margin side. Now, on the good news side, if you look at the parts of the portfolio, and it\u2019s a good deal of the portfolio that is not in the traditional consumables end of the product lines and does not go through distribution, those product lines generally perform very well. Ormco or orthodontic business continued to perform well; Implants and Nobel and both those go direct, were both low-single-digit; mid-single-digit quarter performances. Equipment was up low-single-digits broadly. So, I think there is some positive things there, but they were outweighed by that impact of the traditional consumables business and obviously the commensurate impact on the margins. We feel very good, to your point about the costs that we have taken out in the business. You saw a very good margin improvement throughout the course of the last 12 to 18 months. We continue to take cost out of the portfolio. But at the same time, you\u2019ve heard us talk about the Danaher playbook. We are continuing to invest in that business. We believe that the longer term growth drivers are there. And so, I think it\u2019s important that we continue to focus on ensuring that we are well-positioned commercially across a number of geographies and that we\u2019re continuing to invest in innovation. So, it\u2019s a tough balancing act, but we believe it\u2019s right for the long-term. Operator : And we\u2019ll next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. So, I just wanted to talk first maybe a bit about Cepheid. It looked like when I teased out the numbers, it was quite a very strong start to the year for them relative to what we were expecting at least. As you look at sort of the pipeline there and your channel opportunities and you start to understand what\u2019s under the new products, the momentum that business could have, obviously you talked about 10% plus. It seems like it was much more of that in Q1. I guess, how are you thinking about variety of drivers and then what drove some of that outperformance or what appears to be in this quarter? Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks, Ross. Yes. We did have a very good quarter at Cepheid We\u2019re extremely pleased with how that business has performed and how the team has come together and adapted to the Danaher environment, have utilized the tools of the Danaher Business System to drive improvements, not only in terms of the way they\u2019re driving business commercially, but I think importantly, the way they are taking cost out of various areas of business and redeploying some of those savings back into investments for growth. And we\u2019re starting to see the impact of that obviously across the top-line, where we talked about double-digit growth and meaningful margin improvements as well, now margin improvements that are in the double-digit range for sure. So, in terms of what\u2019s driving that growth. It\u2019s pretty well -- it\u2019s pretty broad across the portfolio. Infectious disease, sexual health continues to perform quite well. Hospital acquired infections, while growing a little bit more modestly than the rest of the portfolio, we think are in a very sustainable position over time. And we\u2019re very encouraged by the investments that are being made around advancing the menu and as well as the new instruments that come out. So, I think the business is off to a great start. We\u2019ve seen some good performance and we very much expect that to continue. Ross Muken : And maybe just follow-up on China. It seems like that market continues to be white-hot and sort of the demand is greater than many were sort of estimating 3, 6, 12 months ago. I mean, how do you think about the duration? There are so many moving parts at the macro level there; I mean some of the underlying drivers in the healthcare businesses seem pretty secular. But on the cyclical side, how are you thinking about how much longer that market can kind of continue to accelerate and then maybe remain elevated. Tom Joyce : We feel very good about how we\u2019re positioned in China, Ross, across really each of the five platforms. Our diagnostic platform continues to perform very well and we continue to invest there. We see that growth coming through really across the board, Beckman Diagnostics, Radiometer like the bio-systems. And now, as we\u2019re investing more aggressively Cepheid in the high growth markets, China will become an increasingly important part of Cepheid\u2019s geographic profile. As you know, they\u2019ve been underpenetrated in a number of those markets. Our dental business, Ross, continues to drive consistent double-digit growth each quarter and has for a quite a period of time. We think the underlying drivers in the dental market as well as our outstanding execution and the breadth of that portfolio, speak well to the long-term potential in Dental. Life Science investments continue to be a priority for the Chinese government. While those can sometime shift occasionally between end markets, for example from the food market to maybe primarily basic research in generalizing the underlying drivers around life sciences are quite good. Water Quality, I think we all have an appreciation for the challenges around the environment in China. And the Chinese government\u2019s continued to make the environment and water in particular priority. And we\u2019ve seen some good performance so far this year from our water quality business in China. And PID I think also is well-positioned. So, across the portfolio, we feel great about the Chinese market and the opportunities we have there for sustained double-digit performance. Dan Comas : And Ross, as Tom noted, the acceleration from sort of high-single-digit growth last year to the double-digit growth we saw in the first quarter, was more the breadth -- wasn\u2019t that that health care businesses got stronger, it\u2019s more about the consistent double-digit growth across all the five platforms. Operator : And we will take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Tom, I want to start with Biopharma. We\u2019ve had some mixed data points, certainly this year, Rhodes [ph] have gotten trouble and we even heard from Sartorius and then some of the other European companies about softness. So, given the mid single digit growth in Pall Life Science for you guys, can you maybe talk about some of the trends here you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re hearing from customers? Obviously there\u2019s been more noise on drug pricing this week with J&J and others kind of calling that out. Tom Joyce : Sure. Tycho, we don\u2019t -- we play such a vital role in the biopharma manufacturing process at a relatively low cost to that manufacturing process, the filtration as a component of the overall manufacturing cost is relatively modestly, arguably even marginal, but the value is so high that we think filtration is a very sustainable position across biopharma over the long term. Relative to the overall trend, I think both the high growth of large molecule drugs today that are in the market as well as the pipelines being skewed towards large molecule drugs, both speak well to the long-term growth trajectory of biopharma. There is no question, that\u2019s where all the investment is going over time. And filtration is used more intensively in large molecule drug production than in small molecule drug production. So, I think when we look at it from a macro perspective, we still feel very positive about how the biopharma, particularly manufacturing rates will be sustained over time and how that will benefit Pall, and frankly others of our Life Science businesses that participate in that market. So, certainly, some concerns about that relative to drug prancing, but we think we\u2019re relatively well-positioned in terms of the impact there. Tycho Peterson : And then, can you maybe comment on SCIEX up low-single-digit? I know only 40% of that business is biopharma, but can you maybe just talk about trends for that and what your outlook is for the remainder of the year? Tom Joyce : Sure. SCIEX business has performed exceptionally well over a long period of time. We did post low-single-digit growth here in the quarter. We have a pretty big service business at SCIEX and that was impacted a bit by the one less selling day. So, our outlook is pretty consistent with our past performance, more like mid-single-digit growth in Q3 and beyond. From an end market perspective pharma was an excellent growth driver during the course of the quarter, double-digits led -- it led the way double-digit growth. Applied was more flattish, but finished the quarter a little bit better, so the growth rate -- the order rates were improving through the course for the quarter. China is a very good market there for us, particularly in the applied markets, meaning food and environmental. We have had a bit of tough comp on the clinical side, given some of the changes to -- in physician office lab, reimbursement and so on, and academic has been comp as well. So, those were a little bit of the pluses and minuses. But in general, as we look forward, given the one of our selling day, the service business, how we\u2019ve seen the installed based growth, the order rates, we feel good about SCIEX in the quarters ahead. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thanks. And if I could just ask one last clarification on Pall Industrial. You had the Middle East project you called out for Pall Industrial. Would Pall Industrial have grown excluding that? Dan Comas : Yes. In fact, orders were up mid-single-digit in Q1 for Pall all up as opposed to the low-single-digit on the revenue basis because it is prior year, equipment installed that we had in the Middle East, both in Q1 and we\u2019ll also have piece of that in Q2 as well. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Tom Joyce : Maybe one last point, I know you didn\u2019t ask about it, but it\u2019s probably just a quick mention relative to Phenomenex, which was an acquisition that was led by the SCIEX team and that business is off to a great start. We closed that in the fourth quarter, and it\u2019s been up mid-single-digit since we acquired that business, a little bit of challenging comp in the first quarter, but we\u2019ll lap right over that. So that team\u2019s doing a wonderful job and we couldn\u2019t be happier with the start we have there. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Tom Joyce : Hi, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hey. I\u2019m going to follow up on Tycho\u2019s question there. So, any signs at all in the U.S. academic market in particular that there is any hesitation in terms of ordering or wanting to spend money just given some of the uncertainties in Washington around funding? Tom Joyce : Peering into the psychology is a challenging thing for me. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s going on in terms of the proposed budgets and so on. So, I think there has to be a little bit of concern and hesitation out there. But it\u2019s not like we can point to something very specific that impacted our order rates. In terms of NIH funding specifically, we don\u2019t -- as I think you probably know already, we don\u2019t have a very high degree of direct exposure to NIH funding, less than 5% of our Life Science sales comes directly from the NIH and somewhat more than that indirectly. But when you step back and you look at our life science business, approaching half the businesses goes into pharma, mostly biopharma and applied, food and environmental. And then of course you have actually some more industrially oriented exposure in our Life Science business. Our academic and research exposure is probably sub-20%. And yes, I think there is some hesitation out there but I can\u2019t point to specific projects. Interestingly, I think maybe one counterpoint would be Leica Microsystems had a terrific quarter. And those products, particularly confocals can be the types of high CapEx expenditures that can give some folks pause in the academic and the research area. And we saw good growth there over the course of the quarter. So, a little bit of a counterpoint that would make for uncertainty. Derik De Bruin : And just one follow-up on this, R&D expense in the quarter is 6.4% of sales, how should we look about this rolling across for the rest of the year? Dan Comas : Part of the step up was organic and part of it was the inclusion of Cepheid in the number, but we should be in that sort of ZIP code through the year. Operator : And we will take our next question from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Tom, just wondering, how you view the past from this kind of organic level up to something closer to 4%, I guess some of the acquisitions going organic maybe as a piece and getting this dental consumables off the math. But you also mentioned several times investments and innovation, commercial initiatives, are the investments you\u2019re making, are the payoffs going to ramp from those type of things, do you have visibility into that just wondering sort of the path from 2.5 up to 4? Tom Joyce : Yes. Shannon, you\u2019ve hit on a number of the key drivers, even within your question. Clearly, the acquisitions will have some impact as Cepheid and Phenomenex come into the core later on this year, we would expect to see some impact there. Yes, absolutely, we would need to see some improvement in the dental consumables market. As we\u2019ve said in the past, these types of slowdowns tend to write themselves over time, both in terms of the channel inventories as well as the overall sell-through, if you will. So, I think we will see some improvement there, probably not in the second quarter but more likely in the second half. And yes, we\u2019ve made -- we continue to make investments. Derik asked us about R&D as a percent of sales; we continue to invest in R&D as well as in commercial initiatives. And we do see payoffs there. We\u2019ve seen them in the past; we\u2019ve seen, for example, at SCIEX, where we\u2019ve increased R&D as a percent of sales from 7% years ago around the acquisition, now to 10% and where the flow of new products has been dramatically increased, and that\u2019s led to the sustained growth rates and the improvement in share gains. I think Videojet is another tremendous example of where, not only the power of DBS, but the investments in R&D and commercial initiatives globally have expanded their service offering, their remote capabilities. We often refer to them as the lifecycle initiatives that have driven better service contract attachment. We\u2019ve seen mid-single-digit growth at Videojet consistently over a seven-year of period. And that\u2019s the impact of work that was done a number of years ago in terms of new products and commercial investment. So, as we get to some of the more investments that are making more on a near-term basis, it will take time for those to pay-off. But it\u2019s clear that investments that we\u2019ve been in the past have had real impact? So, that gives us confidence that over time, and over time is longer than a couple of quarters, even though we do expect to see a ramp in the second half of the year, but we know these investments pay off in time. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, great. And then just on cash flow, operating cash flow is down a little bit year-over-year and the CapEx was up, maybe just little color on those dynamics of both of those components? Dan Comas : Shannon, the primary driver in the operating cash flow is really just the timing around tax payments. Our tax payments were $60 million, $70 million higher Q1. As you remember, we had relatively modest tax payments the first three quarters of last year and then very, very heavy tax payments, over 400 million in the fourth quarter. I think you\u2019ll see more normalization of that as we go through the year. I think we\u2019re set up for again high-single-digit 10% sort of growth in free cash flow for the full year. The CapEx increased primarily the new acquisitions, Cepheid, Phenomenex and again just some timing issues as well. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Doug Schenkel : Good morning. I want to start by going back to Pall. Mid-single-digit Life Science revenue growth is good, but weaker than we had in our model, our moderation below recent trend. I just want to be clear that you would distribute the moderation in growth to a tougher double-digit revenue growth comparison rather than any change in market conditions. And relatively, what assumptions for Pall growth are embedded into guidance for the balance of the year, especially given some of the strong bookings commentary that you shared earlier on the Q&A? Tom Joyce : Sure. Doug, that mid-single-digit growth at Pall Life Science really had some impact of the one last selling day. So that\u2019s probably the first impact that we would point to. Overall, we see that market, as I mentioned earlier, continue to have great underlying and very fundamental drivers, utilization of filtration, continue to be an important part of large molecule drug. So, we don\u2019t see anything that would suggest that there\u2019d be any moderation in that business. In fact, we would see it as being a pretty consistent performer over time. So, we feel good about that. Doug, remind me; I am sorry. What was the second part of your question? Dan Comas : He\u2019s asking about what\u2019s embedded in the guidance for the full year. We would expect comparable low-single-digit growth in the second quarter, again absent the project that we shipped half of that in the first quarter, half of the equipment in the second quarter of last year, we would expect to be mid single digit. So, we would expect order growth closer to mid single digits in the second quarter. And we think that t\u2019s this up from mid single digit growth at Pall in the second half for the year. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And that\u2019s a good segue to I guess my follow-up. Your guidance for the second quarter for core growth is around 3%. This is against a slightly more difficult year-over-year comparison versus what\u2019s the case in the first quarter. Can you help us peel out [ph] in which segments or end markets you expect growth to improve in the second quarter versus what you saw in the first quarter? Tom Joyce : I think what we said in the script is we expect growth comparable to what we had -- core growth comparable to what we had in the first quarter. And looking at across the four segments, we would expect roughly similar performance for each of the four segments in the second quarter. Doug Schenkel : Lastly, real just quick one. Did flu contribute meaningfully to Cepheid growth in the quarter? There is some commentary out there and some data out there that suggests that that could have been an outsized driver in the quarter. Could you comment on whether that was the case? Thank you. Tom Joyce : Flu? Doug, we\u2019re not far enough [ph] beyond the separation of [multiple speakers]. Dan Comas : We all misheard that. Tom Joyce : Sorry. There was a pregnant pause there, now you know why. Doug Schenkel : Influenza. Tom Joyce : Influenza, right, in the publically available market data on flu it was \u201ca good flu season\u201d. I\u2019m not sure I would describe it is an outsized impact but in general, it was a good flu season and that contributed to the overall growth. Operator : We will go next to see Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : I have an easy one for Dan and then I\u2019ll apologize; I have a more complicated one for Tom. The easy question for Dan is, hey, Dan, can you just help us understand and you\u2019ve alluded to this a little bit in discussions around service and around Pall. Where the selling day impact in the quarter might have been more or less significant across the businesses just so we can tune up the models appropriately? And then, question for Tom -- the question for Tom is you\u2019re uniquely qualified to think about multilayered distribution strategies across the businesses given your experience, not just at Danaher but what is now Fortive. And so, I wonder how you\u2019re thinking as you work with your, particularly your life sciences and dental teams about ecommerce. It seems to be one of the more important questions that management teams in the space are thinking about, what\u2019s the right time to use ecommerce as a way to get closer to customers and potentially to think about it as a lever to improve margins in those businesses. So, I wonder if you could give you -- the wisdom of your experience across the businesses that you might be sharing with those managements teams as they think about how and when to become more active with ecommerce partners? Thanks so much. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Steve, I\u2019ll take the first one. Steve Beuchaw : Sure. Tom Joyce : So, Steve, I\u2019ll take the first one and then again come back on the impacts of the selling days and so on. Thank you for the comment. I\u2019m not sure how uniquely qualified I am, but I do have some perspectives for certain about how we think about layered distribution strategies or you might say multipronged distribution strategies across each of our platforms. You asked about Life Sciences and Dental, but let me talk broadly first. When we think about ecommerce, when we think about selling directly to customers through either our own portal or someone else\u2019s portal, we think about how customers want to buy. That\u2019s first and foremost. There is no point in having an ecommerce strategy if you determine that customers have no interest in buying that way for a variety of different reasons. So, the typical characteristics of products where we\u2019ve had great success strategically using ecommerce have been lower dollar value products, high usage, high turn products, products that are ordered somewhat routinely that require somewhat limited or more limited technical support and certainly more levels of service. So, when you have products like that, customers generally want it to be easy to buy. And a great example of that for us is our Hach business. In the Hach business, sales to municipalities and industrial facilities, we install an instrument and then there is a routine level of usage of consumables that the customer is really familiar with. They\u2019re relatively low cost consumables, but they\u2019re high value consumables. Customer is super familiar with them, so they don\u2019t need a lot of technical support and they don\u2019t need any service.\\ And as a result of that, Hach is growing their ecommerce business high-single-digits to double-digits consistently over, frankly, as many years as I can remember. Admittedly, we started off a small base a number of years ago, but we continue to invest there. I think that\u2019s a great example of where we\u2019ve used it very strategically and aligned ecommerce with the way customers want to buy. Now to go back to some of the areas specifically in your question, there is a whole bunch of products in our life science platform where ecommerce isn\u2019t terribly well suited to procurement of a confocal microscope from -- like a Microsystems or mass spectrometer from AB SCIEX. But clearly, consumables for our Flow Cytometry business would be a great example. In the Dental platform, there are lots of opportunities for ecommerce. What we generally found is that the channel as it exists today, particularly in North America, provides those ecommerce capabilities. Whether you\u2019re talking about Schein or Patterson or Benco or anyone of a number of others, they do quite a nice job with relatively low costs, low-tech, quick carrying consumables on ecommerce basis. And so, one angle is to align yourself strategically with distribution that has that capability and in another case maybe to have that capability yourself, if you\u2019re the right player and you have the destination of choice. So, those are some of the ways we think about it. Steve, hopefully that gives you some insight in terms of the way I think about it. Dan Comas : Steve, in terms of the days issue, it really impacts our consumables business. So, the 35% of our business at instrumentation and equipment, we typically don\u2019t see an impact when we have a change a day or two in the quarter. But across Beckman diagnostics and Dental consumables, Videojet, Hach, Pall, filtration, where they\u2019re shipping consumables on a daily basis, we tend to fell that. In the first quarter, our equipment sales were up 2.5%; that\u2019s been pretty consistent the last couple of quarters. But our consumables, which tend to maybe a 100 basis points, 50 to 75 basis points better than that the last couple of quarters, they were also 2.5% and we think prior that impact was because of the days. Steve Beuchaw : Exactly, what I needed. Thanks, guys. Operator : We will go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : I had a question on the diagnostics business. I was wondering for a bit of an update on the Cepheid omni platform. And the reason I ask is you know that clearly market is huge opportunity, it\u2019s still very early but it isn\u2019t like you have couple strong first movers, making progress here that Roche recently got there going as well. So, I\u2019m just curious kind if you put all that in context, how important that platform will be to sustain in the double digit growth you\u2019re seeing in that franchise over a long-term period. Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks, Isaac. Post acquisition where we\u2019ve really gotten up close in personal with the omni platform, we were very excited about its potential. We think it has exceptional opportunities to extend the already well-characterized, Cepheid menu to lower volume environments to physician labs and closer to the point of care, certainly at what we think will be an attractive instrumentation cost level as well. We\u2019ve got a chance to work directly with the R&D teams and the product management teams that are on omni right now. And we\u2019re very confident in the potential of that platform. I think realistically, there were couple of things that we wanted the team to sure up, technically around that product and couple of things that we wanted to make sure were in place commercially as well. And so right now, we\u2019re looking at probably the first, early part of next year, maybe even as early as first quarter next year for that launch, just to make sure that we have that in the best shape possible. Isaac Ro : Great. And then, just maybe a follow-up on your earlier comments regarding the Dental business. Just trying to kind of weight which is the two factors here are maybe more important to driving better top line growth. Is it end-market performance or is it maybe more of internal kind of product line issue. And I know you guys have made some changes there over the last year, so I want to be patient, but sort of curious if it\u2019s a market environment thing or more of a Danaher thing. Tom Joyce : I think in the area where the softness has been most acute, the traditional consumables business, it\u2019s really a combination of seeing some better sell-through that\u2019s the function of just the overall market as well as the channel, being comfortable that they right size inventories and have sort of lapped over that adjustment. So, I think, those are probably the most important things on a near-term basis. I think from an internal Danaher perspective, our goal is continue to invest in innovation in the traditional consumables side as well as to continue to improve the performance in the businesses that quite frankly are already performing quite well at a mid single digit rate, like Nobel and our equipment business, particularly with the investments that we\u2019ve made in digital dentistry where going back to a question that was asked earlier about indefinite levels that we\u2019ve made. We 2x the number of software engineers; they\u2019re focused on digital dentistry across the platform, and I think that\u2019s an example of something we\u2019re working on internally that\u2019s an investment that will pay off over time. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our last question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just had a couple of cleanup questions here. For the Fortive spin for Dan, is there anything to call out regarding shared service agreements and anything on -- or might be some remaining stranded costs? Dan Comas : They\u2019re relatively -- we\u2019re pretty far being completed with that; there are few small services back and forth. But I think size [ph] there relatively de minimis. Deane Dray : Got it. And then any comments on what the product lines transfer from life sciences to environmental are? Dan Comas : That was the Pall water business. Deane Dray : So, we\u2019ve been waiting for this. Is there anything in terms of new product launches? There\u2019s been discussions at some of the trade shows that you might be, that you\u2019re launching a mobile water treatment, truck based, should we be looking for that in the near-term? Tom Joyce : It\u2019s really we literally just transferred the responsibility for that product line here in the first quarter over to water platform. And so, almost as if it were a newly acquired business that team is going through, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d say 100-day strategic plan. But they\u2019re looking at that business strategically and trying to figure out where the right investments are across that portfolio. There are a lot of different opportunities there, but we have to be selective about those; it\u2019s not a huge business; it\u2019s sub-700 million but it does need some work. And making the right investments from a product standpoint is going to be important there. So, it\u2019s a little too early to say, but maybe in a quarter or two, we can give you some more insight. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tracey, and thanks everyone for joining us. We\u2019re around all day for questions. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, solid core operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow performance. Pall and Cepheid are two most recent largest acquisitions, also continued to perform very well. Looking ahead, we expect our core growth rate in the second half of 2017 to accelerate compared to first half levels, driven by improving order trends and as recent acquisition by Cepheid and Phenomenex become part of our core revenue. And with our continued strong free cash flow generation and strengthening balance sheet, we feel well positioned to actively pursue larger acquisition opportunities going forward. With that as a backdrop, let's move to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net EPS was $0.99, which represents an increase of 10% over the last year. Sales increased 6.5% to $4.5 billion, and core revenue grew 2%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 6%. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up low single digits, with solid results in the U.S. and Japan slightly offset by performance in Western Europe. High-growth markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by China, which delivered high single-digit growth or better in each of our four segments. Reported operating profit margins declined 150 basis points to 15.2%, primarily due to the impact of charges related to the discontinuation of a product line in our Diagnostics segment and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. Our core operating margin increased 70 basis points with the strong performance led by our Life Sciences, Environmental and Applied Solutions, and Dental segments. Strong free cash flow enables us to pursue high-impact growth opportunities across our portfolio, and it continues to be one of our most important metrics at Danahar. We generated $892 million of free cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 160%. We now anticipate full year 2017 free cash flow to grow double digit over 2016.  On the M&A front, we closed three bolt-on acquisitions during the quarter, totaling approximately $100 million of spend in our product ID, product quality and life sciences platforms. Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our performance across the portfolio.  In Life Sciences, reported revenues increased 4% and core revenue grew 3.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased by 150 basis points to 16%, and core operating margin was up 120 basis points. This continued margin expansion was driven by the team\u2019s consistent execution across the life science platform. Beckman Life Sciences delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth with positive performance across all major product lines, most notably, transportation and automation. Beckman\u2019s recently launched Biomek i-Series Automated Workstations are gaining traction in the market, and several key automation projects contributed to strong results in North America. We saw a broad-based growth geographically, and we\u2019re well positioned in China to benefit from the region\u2019s continued investment in biopharma and life science research. One of Danahar\u2019s core values is, \u201cinnovation defines our future\u201d, and since we acquired Beckman Life Sciences in 2011, this has been a key area of focus for the team. They have increased new product launches meaningfully with more than 10 new product introductions in each of the last two years, and this cadence of innovation has been a key driver of Beckman Life Sciences\u2019 enhanced growth trajectory. What was a flat core growth business at the time of acquisition is now a mid-single-digit performer that has continued to gain share in its markets.  Leica Microsystems core revenue was up low single digits with good performance across high-growth markets, partially offset by weakness in developed markets. At SCIEX, core revenue increased in a mid-single-digit rate, led by strength in the pharmaceutical and food testing end markets, while academic demand was stable across most major geographies. At the ASMS Annual Conference in June, SCIEX highlighted the market\u2019s first FDA-cleared vitamin D assay for in vitro diagnostic use exclusively on our clinical mass spec platform the Topaz System. Topaz and its accompanying clear core software are easy to learn and validate and have been specifically designed for the clinical lab. This new solution with the SCIEX vitamin D assay will enable clinical labs to expand their in-house testing services and run more tests more efficiently while delivering more confident results to support physicians with their critical treatment decisions.  Pall reported low single-digit core revenue growth with positive performance in both our life sciences and industrial businesses, partly impacted by a tough prior year comparison. At Pall Life Sciences, growth was driven by biopharma, particularly double-digit growth in single-use technologies. At Pall Industrial, modest growth was driven by microelectronics and aerospace. Declines in process and industrial was due to a large Middle East project in the first half of last year that did not repeat. But we are encouraged by healthy order growth across this business and expect improved performance in the second half of the year. Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 14.5%, and core revenue grew 2.5%. Reported operating margin declined 760 basis points to 10.9%, and core operating margin was down 25 basis points. These margin declines are largely due to the restructuring charges associated with our decision to discontinue to Beckman VERIS molecular diagnostics product line and the acquisition impact of the Cepheid transaction. Absent the impact of the restructuring charges, Diagnostics\u2019 reported operating margin was up more than 400 basis points from the first quarter. Last month, we announced to our customers the decision to redirect our team\u2019s molecular diagnostic efforts from the Beckman VERIS platform over to Cepheid. We are committed to providing the best solutions for our customers, and we believe that Cepheid molecular systems provide a better longer-term foundation for these efforts. Cepheid\u2019s platform offers industry-leading throughput and the most comprehensive molecular test menu on a single system. We believe that focusing investment on this technology, combined with Beckman\u2019s strong global market presence, will accelerate our ability to provide more comprehensive molecular solutions to benefit our customers. As a result, we incurred total charges of approximately $76 million, of which $49 million were non-cash related to the impairment of certain intangible and other related assets and $27 million in cash charges. We expect these cash charges to result in a benefit of approximately $40 million in annual savings in 2018. Turning to Cepheid second quarter results. Double-digit core revenue growth was driven by broad-based strength across most major geographies and product lines. The team is consistently incorporating DBS tools into the day-to-day processes, and their efforts have sustained the double-digit operating profit margins achieved in the first quarter. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter increased at a low single-digit rate with growth in China and North America partially offset by declines in Western Europe and Japan. Byproduct line, our chemistry and immunoassay businesses continued to lead the way. Radiometer\u2019s core revenue grew low single digits, led by another quarter of growth across our blood gas and AQT product lines. In May, Radiometer launched the crea and urea parameters on the ABL90. These are two new blood tests that identify potentially life-threatening problems with kidney function. Radiometer now offers 19 critical care parameters, the broadest range available on a compact platform that delivers crucial results in just 35 seconds. As the most comprehensive blood gas testing provider in the world, Radiometer\u2019s innovations are helping caregivers make critical diagnostic decisions that save lives every day. At Leica Biosystems, core revenue was up mid-single digits with growth across both developed and high-growth markets. Leica\u2019s performance was led by another strong quarter in our advanced staining business, and we saw solid results across our core histology product line as well.  Turning to our Dental segment. Reported revenue was down 1.5% and core revenue was down 1%. Supported operating profit margin increased 30 basis points and core operating margin was up 50 basis points, due primarily to the benefits from ongoing productivity initiatives. During the quarter, we saw positive growth in our equipment and specialty consumable product lines, including implants and orthodontics. This was more than offset by a decline in our traditional consumables businesses, which was due primarily to continued inventory destocking by several of our distribution partner, primarily in North America and Western Europe. We believe these channel dynamics will continue and expect our Dental core growth rates in the second half of the year to be consistent with the results we\u2019ve seen so far in the first half. Recognizing the near-term challenges, we remain focused on building greater long-term value across our dental platform. The team\u2019s recent operational improvements have supported reinvestment in growth initiatives to increase the cadence of product innovation, improve quality and enhance commercial execution.  Over the last two years, we have improved our operating profit margin by more than a 100 basis points and seeing consistent growth rates in several of our key product categories. We continue to focus on positioning our dental business for sustainable long-term growth and value creation.  Moving to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 4.5% and core revenue was up 3%. Reported operating profit margins increased 70 basis points, while core operating margin was up 120 basis points.  In product identification, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate. We saw continued healthy demand for our marking and coding equipment and consumables in most major geographies, led by North America. Demand for our packaging and color solutions was driven by strength in high-growth market. Videojet\u2019s core revenue growth was up mid-single digits, and the team continued to build upon their track record of outperformance. We saw balanced growth across North America, Western Europe and Asia.  Videojet grew across all major product lines and launched three new products in May, including the Videojet 1860 printer, our new industrial inkjet platform. The 1860\u2019s key differentiator is the combination of onboard-predictive analytics and remote connectivity. The advanced maintenance analytics can alert operators well before common downtime issues arise, and the remote service capability enables operators to recover quickly from production line interruptions without an onsite service visit. The 1860 printer has been specifically designed to help our customers improve their uptime and productivity and driver lower operating costs. Customers rely on Videojet solutions to print on more than 10 billion products daily, and we now have the largest installed base of remotely connected printers worldwide. Core revenue at Esko was up mid-single digits, the growth driven by an acceleration in Europe and the high-growth markets. Finally, turning to water quality. Core revenue growth increased at a low single-digit rate with particular strength in our water treatment businesses. At Hach, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. We saw a solid growth in our core municipal and industrial end markets and another good quarter of performance in China. This was partially offset by weakness in Latin America and project timing in our environmental businesses. Looking ahead, we expect that Hach will show improved core growth in the second half of the year. Trojan delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, a result that the team has now achieved in eight of the last 10 quarters. We saw healthy demand across the municipal end markets in North America and China, with robust project activity in those regions. An important factor in Trojan\u2019s project win rate has been the ability to provide our customers with outstanding technology solutions. Trojan recently expanded the capabilities of one of its core wastewater product lines, TrojanUV Signa, to broaden its applications, and it can now be used at nearly any size wastewater facility and for water reuse. This advancement enhances Trojan\u2019s competitive advantage and has been a key driver of recent demand. ChemTreat continued to outperform with high single-digit core revenue growth, driven by positive momentum in North and Latin America. We saw particular strength across the food, fuel, and oil and gas end markets, and the team\u2019s consistent execution contributed to additional share gains across the businesses. So to wrap up, the team executed well during the second quarter driving double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow performance. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect our core growth rate to accelerate versus the first half levels of improving order trends and as recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex become part of our core revenue. We belief that the power of the Danaher Business System, significant opportunity across our portfolio and strengthening balance sheet position, all come together to position us well for the remainder of 2017 and beyond. We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.92 and $0.96 and expect core revenue growth of approximately 3%. We are raising our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $3.90 to $3.97. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Lauren, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Hi, good morning, guys. So maybe just first touching on sort of the sequential growth acceleration you\u2019re looking for, a lot of moving parts in the business. It feels like maybe in environmental and water, there was also maybe a bit of order push-out. Can you just give us some color and help us bridge back to a growth rate for Danahar that would be more consistent with what we would think about for these businesses. Again, you had a lot of comp noise and some order movements. You\u2019ve obviously got the acquisitions as you\u2019ve said. So help us sort of walk through the parts and then your confidence level in turning some of the pieces like dental, where the growth rates are obviously not where you wanted to be. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but that you\u2019ve got the right sort of plan and that you understand why it\u2019s underperformed and in turn can get back to that more normalized rate. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Good morning, Ross. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Let\u2019s start with the jumping-off point, Ross, of sort of the second quarter end and the first half. If we look at the 2% in the quarter and really look through that to the order rate, and we\u2019re actually rather encouraged by the core orders, which were 100 basis points better than our core growth. When we look at the second quarter number that we put up, that was mostly obviously due to dental. Our expectations were in line with dental being closer to a flat number came in lower than that, down slightly, and the results of that really represented the difference between the 2% we put up and the 2.5% that we expected. So it was really largely around the dental. I\u2019ll come back to water in just a second and your point about timing. We are seeing the continued destocking that I mentioned, and that\u2019s primarily around the traditional consumables side, and we look at the rest of the dental portfolio, and as I mentioned, we continue to see good performance across our specialty consumables businesses as well as equipment. And so, I think we need to get through these adjustments relative to the channel before we can see some better performance from the dental platform, and as a result of that, we thought it was a relatively prudent approach to think of that as being consistent in the second half of the year with the first half of the year until we can get through those.  I\u2019ll come back to the forward look here in a second, but I thought there were a number of encouraging things around the jumping-off, or starting point, here in the second quarter and the first half. Life Science in particular at 3.5%, a little bit better than expectations; really good performance at Beck Life Science; and at SCIEX as well, both mid-single digit, very good quarters. And despite the lower number that we put up at Pall, and you mentioned this briefly in your question, a very challenging comp at Pall both in terms of the life science side as well as the industrial side relative to the first half of last year and specifically the second quarter. So I think there is a number of things to point to you that would suggest that there are some things that underlies the first half, which, once we get passed, would suggest better performance in the second half. So the first half, you\u2019re really looking at a 2.5% sort of start, again, encouraged by the core orders that were about 100 basis points better than that. We get passed the comp issues at Pall. We see Cepheid and Phenomenex coming into the core and some modest improvement in water quality, particularly as it relates to this timing in Hach environmental, which were some larger orders, I think that 3% number that we\u2019re looking for in the third quarter and some better numbers than that in the fourth quarter, all feel quite reasonable to us. If I step back even further back for a second, Ross, we\u2019ve done a portfolio here that\u2019s demonstrated over the last couple of years, the ability to drive 3%, 3.5% core growth as a starting point. And so, I think, with some of these further factors, again, we\u2019re relatively encouraged about the potential here. At a macro level, we think the exposures that we have to high-growth end markets, like biologics, like food and environmental, our growing position in molecular, even the opportunities that we have in the dental platform around the digitization of dentistry, all are strong macro drivers that underpin this platform. Recent acquisitions are clearly faster-growing businesses than in the underlying portfolio that they came in to, and again, improvement at more recently acquired businesses that we\u2019ve talked about for a period of time here, the newness of this portfolio and our ability to drive core growth that we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past with newer businesses. I think, you put all those things together, and I think there\u2019s a lot of reasons to be optimistic for the acceleration that we\u2019re looking for in the second half. So I know it\u2019s a bit of a long-winded answer. Apologize for that, but hopefully that gives you a sense of things. Ross Muken : No, that\u2019s helpful. And just maybe as you\u2019re thinking about \u2013 again, you made comments around the balance sheet and, obviously, the ability at this point given where you with Cepheid and other assets to potentially contemplate other M&A, can you kind of remind us, given the current environment and sort of where the business mix and how the different pieces are performing, kind of what your bias is right now in terms of the style of assets you\u2019re looking for and maybe in all sort of size limits, et cetera? Thomas Patrick Joyce : Ross, just in terms of the balance sheet, I mean, we feel very good about it, particularly given the exceptional free cash flow that we delivered here in the quarter, nearly $900 million of free cash flow in great conversion continues to position the balance sheet exceptionally well for further acquisition efforts. We\u2019ve talked to $500 billion worth of opportunities here in the second half, but by the time we round the corner, with this bubble of free cash flow generation, round the corner into 2018, we\u2019d be back to spending certainly at a free cash flow level or beyond. So I think our bias from a size standpoint continues to increase as the balance sheet returns to fighting shape. Relative to our business model and our preferences, obviously, our past track record here in the last couple of years would suggest we look for businesses with strong underlying growth capabilities and growth trajectory in strong market positions, leading positions in those markets. You\u2019ve seen us build our position relative to the consumables and aftermarket in our businesses. Today, we are at roughly 55% consumables, and we think that underpins the level of market and volumes visibility and stability and also underpins good gross margins and strong operating margins. We look for global businesses and exposure and opportunities to high-growth markets. I think Cepheid is a great example of a business that has tremendous opportunities in high-growth markets but largely under-penetrated in those markets. And so, I think a continued bias towards strong growth rate, good consumables businesses, balanced with exceptional installed bases that are anchored by strong brand, global positions and high-growth market opportunities, I think all represent the kind of model that we\u2019d be looking for in future acquisitions. So hopefully that helps. Ross Muken : All the color was super helpful. Thanks, Tom. Thomas Patrick Joyce : You bet, Ross. Thanks for the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Tom, I mean, I think you called out a softness in the US clinical market both from spec and Beckman. Is that all ACA/PAMA noise? And, I guess, with Beckman still stuck in the kind of low single-digit growth, what gives you a comfort in an acceleration in the back half of the year for that? Thomas Patrick Joyce : Thanks, Tycho. Tycho, we actually in mass spec, we had a very good quarter in mass spec with good performance, particularly in pharma and in the applied markets. The only softness that we saw around mass spec, which is not really new news, we\u2019ve seen it earlier this year and it really is a comp versus prior year, is really around the clinical anchored store clinical position in mass spec around pain panels. And as some of the reimbursement chains in pain panels, we saw a headwind there, and we\u2019ll get through that headwind in the balance of this year; but otherwise, good performance, a very good performance SCIEX generally across the number of the end markets.  At Beckman, in diagnostics, we were very encouraged by the continued improvement particularly in North America with improving retention rates that we track very consistently as well as competitive win rates. That being said, we do believe that there is some uncertainty in the end markets today around ACA and what ultimately happens there. We\u2019ve seen some hesitation on the part of some customers to make some decisions, and we\u2019re going to need to get through that. I don\u2019t think the happenings of the past week have done much to eliminate that uncertainty; but in the meantime, I think we\u2019re driving what we can control well, which is ensuring that we serve our current customers well and drive increasing levels of customer retention and enhancing our win rates, and that\u2019s coming partly on the back of the work that we\u2019ve done in terms of new products, both in terms of our hematology platform as well as assays that we\u2019ve launched around AMH and vitamin D. So we are encouraged by the performance there. We think that the rationalization of the product portfolio between the VERIS, the VERIS platform and the Cepheid platform is going to enhance our position in what is arguably the fastest growing segment of the diagnostic market, which is molecular. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then \u2013 and geographically, the PMI indicators have actually been better out of Europe, you called out softness there. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in some of the leading indicators? Thomas Patrick Joyce : Sure. Well, both in terms of leading and the lagging, Western Europe actually is \u2013 our softness there is largely around our dental platform. We had a number of businesses that performed quite well in Europe, but we would put the bulk of that softness in Western Europe around dental. Tycho Peterson : Okay, and then just lastly on the dental. You\u2019ve called up pricing in the 10-Q. That seems to be a bit of a new dynamic is \u2013 just maybe quantify how much of impact that had versus destocking? Daniel L. Comas: Tycho, it\u2019s very, very modest. We\u2019re talking 20 basis points. And we were flat in pricing in dental. In the first quarter, we were just down ever so slightly. A little bit of that is mix. Given consumables, where we tend to get more pricing, was so weak in the second quarter, I don\u2019t think there is any meaningful change in pricing in dental. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thanks. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Good morning. Derik De Bruin : Hey, a couple of questions that I\u2019m going to focus on diagnostics. It looks like the core operating profit margin on diagnostics, it was down 25 bps when you exclude everything, and I think this was second quarter in a row. Is there just some talks \u2013 some comments on the margin trend there and what impacting it? And then the other question is, it looks like Cepheid is growing 18-ish percent on an \u2013 if I look at the numbers. That\u2019s definitely -- last quarter and this quarter, definitely your Cepheid numbers are above what we have modeled as a standalone for the company when we \u2013 the company was still public. Could you talk a little bit about is it ensured placements, is it higher utilization on Cepheid? Just color on the revenue trends, if it\u2019s bulk high market growth \u2013 high developing market, high-burden market? Just a little bit more color on what the Cepheid numbers are? Daniel L. Comas: Sure. You bet, Derik. So let\u2019s start with the Dx operating margins. The \u2013 what we put up is negative 25 basis points. If you look at the FX impact on that, which in the case of a diagnostics is probably one of the more notable impacts of FX in the quarter, net of FX diagnostics actually put a positive 50 basis points. Derik De Bruin : Got it. Daniel L. Comas: Operating margin. So, underlying operating margin -- and that is, if you look at the improvement from the first quarter, that\u2019s where my comments earlier represent a 400 basis point improvement over our operating margin performance in the first quarter, so good trajectory and good underlying performance. So, we feel pretty good about what\u2019s going on there. Turning to Cepheid. You\u2019re right. We put up some pretty significant double-digit growth rates there at Cepheid so far through the first half of this year, and those are higher growth rates than what we\u2019ve seen historically. Derik, that\u2019s largely a function of some fairly large orders that we had both in the first and the second quarter, largely associated, but not exclusively, but largely associated with the high-growth markets. We continue to believe that Cepheid on a go-forward basis is a solid 10% kind of growth business. So we love the fact that we are putting up the numbers we are, and we continue to go aggressively towards large tender wins. But obviously those are a little less predictable and -- but we feel very comfortable with a sustained 10% flat double-digit growth rate going forward. Utilization remains quite good. We track utilization sort of account by account. So I think the underlying performance of the business both in terms of placements in the developed markets as well as utilization across the breath of the menu remains consistent and in some cases actually improving through some growth initiatives that the team is putting forward. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you very much. Daniel L. Comas: Thanks, Derik. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. Starting on guidance. For the year, what is your core revenue growth target? And what are you targeting by business? And then related to that, could you just speak to how ongoing dental weakness is impacting your growth outlook for the year as we sit here today relative to where we were, say, 90 days ago? Daniel L. Comas: Dough, so what we are talking about is an acceleration to 3% ballpark, a 3% core growth in the third quarter and better than that here in the fourth quarter. Tom talked about the underpinnings about better order growth. We did have the unusual dynamic in the second quarter that core order growth was better than shipment growth in every one of our four reporting segments, and that\u2019s part of the encouragement we have kind of going into Q3 and the second half year. A high-level perspective, if we look at the second half, we expect three of the four platforms, excluding Dental, to accelerate here from where we are in the second quarter. Dental we expect versus relatively flat in the first quarter, we have a pretty conservative assumption here around dental here for the balance of the year, given the comments that Tom already made. Doug Schenkel : Okay, understood, and that\u2019s helpful. But to be clear, you don\u2019t want to give specific by segment or full year core growth targets and you don\u2019t want to comment on how dental has changed relative to what you\u2019re embedding into guidance if it has changed relative to where we were a quarter or two ago, correct? Daniel L. Comas: I think I kind of give you numbers in the total company Q3, Q4. We tend to give directional numbers around the segment. And clearly dental, dental is a lower number here than we were thinking in April. Again, I said that some of the other businesses are performing a little -- expectations were a little better than we thought here in April on the heels of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of order growth and -- better performance around margins is evidenced in the second quarter. Doug Schenkel : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. On dental, a real basic question, and I know it\u2019s a one that comes up probably in every meeting. So I am just looking to get educated again. How was it possible that distributors can still be destocking? It seems like this has been going on for better part of a year, and it seems like you\u2019d expect this is to continue for the balance of the year. I guess, just practically speaking, how much longer do you think this can take? Again, I\u2019m just trying to get educated on this dynamic and also trying to, I guess, at least get a better understanding of how confident you can be that there is not more going on than just destocking. Thomas Patrick Joyce : I think what\u2019s a little bit different about the scenario today versus probably nine months ago is that nine months ago, we were really talking about a phenomenon that the channel first began taking about, which is that the disconnect between what was being sold in and what was being sold out started to create an inventory issue. So as the consumables market began to slow down, distributors began to adjust their order patterns later last year. I think what\u2019s different today that\u2019s enhanced it, Doug, is that there are some channel dynamics going on right now with some shifts in terms of manufacturing distributor alignment, all that\u2019s been made public, and I think that has further exacerbated some of the shifts we\u2019re seeing right now. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s simply a continuation of something that began last year. I think it\u2019s probably a little bit of what went on last year as well as the increased turbulence that\u2019s been associated with some of the shifts in the channel alliances. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thank you. And one last clean-up question pivoting to capital deployment. What do you define as a larger deal? And I know you talked about your capacity in the context of free cash flow. Is the right way to do the math here just look at our free cash flow projections and assume a reasonable leverage ratio and that\u2019s how big you could go in the aggregate over the next year or so? Thank you. Daniel L. Comas: Sure. I mean, we would be -- when we talk larger deal, it\u2019s a -- we view Cepheid, a $4 billion deal, is a larger-type deal. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And then is that math logic pretty safe? Daniel L. Comas: Yeah, I mean that\u2019s about a year or a little bit more a year of free cash flow, plus the earnings you bring on from the acquisitions. Doug Schenkel : Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Thank you, Doug. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A lot of tough questions out this morning so far on the call, so I\u2019m going to go easy. Daniel L. Comas: Steve, please don\u2019t let us down now. Steve Beuchaw : No, no, no. I am -- I consider myself a part of the team here. One team, one dream. The first one is that one that normally come up early, which is, could we just spend just a minute on a couple of areas in terms of the end-market metrics that tend to be high-focused and some are controversial? One is pharma. I saw the commentary in your prepared remarks on the pharma was very, very positive, and it\u2019s fair to say that pharma is holding up and were sort of pass any concerns about the slowdown tied to drug pricing or any other boogieman. And then, I think with the NIH, I think, in the commentary you call that was stable, but I suppose that might be raised and hope for 3Q, because we have an NIH budget, or whether its federal budget. I mean, should we be thinking about 3Q possible being a little better? And then for Dan, shifting gears, I wonder if you can comment on just a couple of things. One, Easter timing, do you think that was at all material in terms of, not necessarily selling days, but activity in the quarter? And then, Dan, how should be think about the tax rate for the second half? Thanks for humoring my many, many questions. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Steve, thanks. So let\u2019s start with pharma. We continue to remain very positive on the pharma market and specifically the biologics portion of the pharma market. As you may have heard us mentioned in the past, we have about $1.5 billion worth of revenue that\u2019s attached to the pharma market, and specifically in the biologics area, and these are largely around the bulk of assets at Pall and at SCIEX as well as a couple of other life science businesses. There is a lot of strong macro drivers, I think, underlying our continued optimism around pharma, specifically around the growth of biologic drugs, the shift from small molecule, investments in small molecule development. It\u2019s a large molecule development. I think you\u2019ve heard us mentioning a number of the statistics that are supportive of that in the past. You mentioned drug pricing, Steve. That does get some air time these days. I think drug pricing, in combination with just broader uncertainty around ACA, I think certainly has to have some impact on pharma companies today. We\u2019ve certainly seen some of our customers manage inventories a little bit more tightly, I think, make sure that they\u2019re managing their cost structures. We feel very \u2013 pretty well insulated from a lot of that because we produced a very high-value consumable at relatively low cost of the overall manufacturing process of a biologic. But nevertheless, these are factors that have to influence these customers in the macro. So while we feel extremely positive about the biologics market continuing, clearly you\u2019ll hear a little bit of noise in the market about uncertainty associated with some of those factors. You did hear me mention accurately about our business in the academic market relatively stable. I think that was specifically probably around SCIEX. That being said, you mentioned NIH. NIH, direct NIH spending is a relatively small portion of our overall life science business. And so while it\u2019s always encouraging to see NIH spending increased, the absolute impact on that, given our small direct NIH spending presence, means it\u2019s a good thing but ultimately doesn\u2019t really move the needle that dramatic. I think it\u2019s a good macro indicator, but I probably wouldn\u2019t go much further than that. Daniel L. Comas: And, Steve, just on the other questions, we expect our tax rate to remain about 20.5% for the balance of the year. We do expect our cash tax payments to be down materially versus prior year. We had exceptionally high cash taxes last year somewhat related to separation. Because of that and because of our strong year-to-date free cash flow, I know we have talked in April about a sort of an expectation of high single-digit growth for free cash flow, we now expect double-digit growth of free cash flow for the full year. Regarding Easter timings, we did hear a little bit of noise, more European businesses, that are having some modest impact to them in the second quarter, but I\u2019m not sure we want to go more than that. Steve Beuchaw : Thank you so much for all the color, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : I was hoping to visit the decision on the VERIS product line shutting that down, what was the tipping point? And just to be clear, this was shut down and not sold and might should we considering other similar actions elsewhere? Thomas Patrick Joyce : Deane, this was a product line discontinuation. It was not a sale or any form of a transaction like that. In terms of a tipping point, I don\u2019t know that there would be necessarily a single point. This was something that we knew or thought about, I should say, as a possibility when we were going through diligence. Obviously, it was well understood that we were going to have an additional product line in molecular diagnostics. What we couldn\u2019t necessarily fully understand until we got beyond diligence close the transaction and really got underneath the product roadmap was the ability for us to continue to scale the gene expert platform and infinity over time both in terms of menu as well as in terms of daily volume or throughput, if you will. And so, as we came to understand the potential that was represented by the Cepheid platform and that unique architecture that they developed, we then were able to really map that against the capabilities of the VERIS platform, the runway in terms of menu expansion of VERIS and the associated process for FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals, and we found that not only did we have a tremendous opportunity in terms of scalability, throughput and assay development, but really it accelerated our position beyond what we anticipated in due diligence. And so it really was through what I think was a pretty thoughtful analysis that really was a team effort between the Cepheid team and the Beckman diagnostic team. They came to a unified conclusion that this was in the best interest of our diagnostic portfolio. Deane Dray : That\u2019s a good color. And then just as a follow-up, and I hope I don\u2019t get the flag for piling on on dental here but, we\u2019ve been dancing around this destocking question, and interestingly, one of your biggest competitors has been talking recently about taking share in this space, and I just was hoping you could comment on that. So beyond the channel alignment noise, have you lost share in the consumable side? Thomas Patrick Joyce : I see no flags throw. Happy to take questions on dental in any dimension. There is no question because -- about the impact of destocking here, because we have a relatively high level of transparency with our major distribution partners around sell out byproduct category for us and against the house. So it\u2019s a mathematical equation. We also have outstanding dialogue and transparency with our channel partners around what their current inventory levels are in terms of weeks and months and what their internal targets are managing their own balance sheet situation. So, I think we are on firm ground factually. I think, from a product line standpoint, I mention that we\u2019ve actually seen good growth in a number of our dental product lines. I think, in those areas where -- on the traditional consumables side, where clearly there has been the weakness that we\u2019ve noticed, while the destocking is pretty mathematical, could there be shifts between individual competitors inside the house that we don\u2019t get full transparency to, certainly it\u2019s possible. But I would say, today, if we lost any share in the consumables side, it would be very marginal. Deane Dray : Got it. Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Can you give us an update on the Cepheid integration? Are you tracking ahead of plan? And do you think you\u2019ve seen some more low-hanging fruit in terms of synergies than maybe you initially anticipated? Thomas Patrick Joyce : Thanks for the question. Cepheid integration has gone extremely well. We have a wonderful team of long-time Cepheid associates, many of whom are in the top leadership positions around the business, and we\u2019ve supplemented that team with a small number of key leaders from the Danaher side : one in operations, one in finance, just to name a couple. And I think the combination of that long-term Cepheid leadership team as well as some of the Danaher associates have continued to make exceptional progress. That progress has really come on the back of a consistent use of the tools of the Danaher business system. Some of that has come in the form of manufacturing productivity improvements, higher levels of volume being moved through given manufacturing cells at lower headcount levels in some cases, but in other cases, simply a function of being able to keep up with the growing demand at the same level of headcount, and therefore, driving higher levels of productivity. So, we\u2019re thrilled with the progress that the team is making operationally. In terms of some of the low-hanging fruits that you asked about, I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent with the expectations that we had. Low-hanging fruit in an acquisition integration typically starts with public company cost, and those company cost have come out of the business. We seen \u2013 we\u2019ve seen very good improvement in areas that we focus on, like indirect costs, which were not managed as tightly over time there as we would typically do at Danaher. We focused on purchase price variance and looking for supplier either rationalization or a combinations with existing Danaher suppliers, where we have outstanding quality and delivery, and some of that integration of suppliers has led to improvement in gross margins from a material cost perspective, and we continued to drive those improvements over time.  In addition to that, I think commercially the teams are working very well together. While we maintain an independent commercial team at Cepheid, we have a tremendous lead-sharing process going on between the businesses across the balance of our diagnostic platform, more enhancing our feet on the street in high-growth markets, specifically in China. I\u2019ve talked about that in a couple of our past conversations. And so we think the opportunities for using the tools of DBS commercially terming driving higher market visibility, leveraging the commercial reach and capabilities of the balance of the diagnostic platform, all set us up very well for continuing good performance at Cepheid. So we couldn\u2019t be happier about the performance both in terms of core growth, operating margin and free cash flow at Cepheid thus far. Erin Wright : Excellent. Thanks. And a follow-up acquisition pipeline and the regulatory environment, specifically on timing, and do any other regulatory uncertainties de-rail our alternatively expedite your decision making process when it comes to acquisitions? How aggressive can you be on the M&A front near term? Thomas Patrick Joyce : I wouldn\u2019t say we see anything in the regulatory environment that would create any undue uncertainty or create any hesitations. We talked earlier today about the capabilities we have with the tremendous free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet. I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned to put that balance sheet to work during the balance of this year and certainly into next year. Erin Wright : Thank you. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Dan Arias : Hi, thanks very much for the question. Maybe just quickly on Pall, unless I missed it. Hoping you can maybe put some numbers around the revenue impact that the Middle East project comp had on the quarter and then how that compares to the headwind that you saw there in 1Q? Daniel L. Comas: It was about a $10-plus million project both in Q1 and in Q2, and that\u2019s we will not have that comparison here in the third and fourth quarter. Dan Arias : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on Cepheid and the pipeline there. I think we\u2019re coming up on the period where the prior team was targeting the point-of-care launch with the omni. Obviously, you guys have your own plan, has your own timeline there, but just wondering if you might be willing to comment on how you\u2019re thinking about that product and that market, what our expectations there should be, now especially as ACC comes around the corner here. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Thanks. You are asking about the omni product line, which we, the prior management team, put in play from our R&D perspective before we acquired the business. We got a chance to get inside the omni product launch opportunity in a great depth. We think that\u2019s an exceptional product with tremendous opportunities. We challenged the team to really make sure that they had done the type of diligence on the technology as well as the commercial side of launching that product. We did that partly through due diligence and then certainly through the strategic plans and the product roadmap reviews that we\u2019ve had. That product is, we\u2019re confident we can launch that product in the first half of next year. I think that product has any exceptional opportunity to drive point-of-care position and an exceptional level of assay capability that will truly revolutionize the point-of-care market. So we feel very good about omni, and we feel good about the launch schedule that we\u2019ve established. Dan Arias : Okay. Thanks very much for that. Thomas Patrick Joyce : Thanks, Dan. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Mr. Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks, everyone, for joining this morning. We\u2019re around all day for questions. Operator : Thank you, and that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Joyce : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter, as we delivered mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth, strong margin expansion and free cash flow, and improving core revenue growth. Our two most recent larger acquisitions, Pall and Cepheid, continue to perform well and both teams have gotten off to a great start as part of Danaher. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, the team's commitment to continuous improvement was a key driver of our results. Our performance in the quarter, combined with a healthy balance sheet, is helping us build momentum for the balance of 2017 and into next year. So with that as a backdrop, let's move into the details of the third quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1 exceeded expectations and represents an increase of 15% over last year. Sales increased 9.5% to $4.5 billion and core revenue grew 3%. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by 1 percentage point and acquisitions increased revenues by 5.5%. Geographically, core revenue in high growth markets was up high single-digits, led by double-digit gains in China. The developed markets increased at a low-single-digit rate with solid results in the U.S. and Japan. Gross margin was 56%, an increase of 70 basis points from last year. And our reported operating margin was unchanged at 16.9%. Core operating margin increased by almost 100 basis points with the strong performance led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. We generated $935 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, resulting in a net income conversion ratio of over 160%. This outstanding free cash flow generation also represents an increase of more than 20% versus last year, and we continue to anticipate double-digit free cash flow growth in 2017. In terms of M&A, so far this year we closed five transactions, totaling more than $100 million of spend. Now let's take a more detail look at our performance across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 5% and core revenue grew 3%. Reported operating profit margin increased by 230 basis points to 17.7%, and core operating margin was up 185 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 100 basis points or better of core margin improvement. And for the first time, our Life Sciences segment EBITDA margin exceeded 25%. At Beckman Life Sciences, core revenue increased at a high-single-digit rate on broad-based strength across all major product lines and regions. Growth in automation was driven by continued demand for the Biomek i-Series Workstations. The new sample preparation platform, the Beckman launched earlier this year. And in Flow Cytometry, the team's continuous innovation around the CytoFLEX platform contributed to further share gains during the quarter. We've expanded CytoFLEX capabilities with the recent launch of two new UV laser offerings, providing higher level analytical sensitivity on the same platform. This differentiated technology is driving sales in new research market by enabling science is to study a wider variety of advanced cell functions and viability, using our system to learn more about diseases and the effectiveness of new treatment options. Leica Microsystems delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth led by strength in North America and Western Europe, primarily in the applied and medical end markets. Earlier this month, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists for their development of cryo-electron microscopy of visualization technology that enables researchers to observe molecular processes that have never been seen before. This achievement is particularly meaningful to Leica as the prizewinners used to our solutions to conduct their work. This is the third time in the past five years that Leica technology has been cited in Nobel Prize winning work, further evidence of the vital role that Leica plays in such critical and revolutionary scientific research. Core revenue with SCIEX was up mid-single-digit with good growth in Western Europe and China. Food and forensic testing led the way in the applied market and we saw sustained momentum in pharmaceutical testing driven in part by heightened regulatory requirements in China. At PALL, core growth declined primarily due to the negative impact of the recent hurricanes in Florida and Puerto Rico. Our thoughts with our associates, customers, suppliers and the communities have been impacted by these events, and we continue to prioritize their safety and wellbeing. We take a look at PALL's performance despite the hurricane impact, our microelectronics and single-use businesses continued to be strong through the quarter, while we saw slower demand across our medical and lab, food and beverage product lines. As we look ahead, we're encouraged by mid-single-digit order growth over the last six months, including double-digit order growth in our biopharma business this quarter, and we expect PALL's core revenue growth rate to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter. Operationally, PALL continues to execute very well, and the team has delivered more than 600 basis points of operating profit margin expansion since we closed the acquisition two years ago. We've reinvested a portion of these savings for growth and use DBS tools like speed design review and strategic product planning to focus our innovation efforts on high impact opportunities. These initiatives have resulted in a 50% increase in annual new product introduction since acquisition, and we are getting these new solutions out into the market faster. Moving to Diagnostics, reported revenue increased 19.5% and core revenue grew 4%. Reported operating margin increased 80 basis points to 16.8%, and core operating margin was up 245 basis points, driven by the team's solid execution across the platform. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low-single-digit rate. We saw solid growth in North America and in the high growth markets. Strength in China and the Middle East offset declines in Latin America. Our immunoassay product line performed very well with continued installed base growth and strong demand for our vitamin D assay. Radiometer's core revenue increased high single-digits with broad demand across developed and high growth markets. The team's execution continues to drive share gains globally in both our blood gas and AQT product lines. Leica Biosystems achieved mid-single-digit core growth, led by strength in Western Europe and China. Growth across all major product lines was led by advanced staining and core histology. We also recently launched the new PELORIS 3 tissue processing system. PELORIS 3 provides our lab customers with high quality traceable results in a shorter turnaround time. An integrated barcode scanner eliminates the need for manual records and reduces specimen handling, helping us address our customers' workflow challenges and improve their lab processes. We're approaching the one-year mark since we closed the acquisition of Cepheid and we continue to be encouraged by the team's performance. Cepheid delivered another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, sustaining the sizeable operating profit improvements achieved over the past year. Earlier this month, Cepheid received FDA clearance for the Xpert, Xpress Group A Strep test, which provides reliable results in as little as 18 minutes. The speed and accuracy of this test allows patients and healthcare providers to access a definitive diagnosis right at the point of care and eliminates the need for lengthy bacterial cultures to confirm the result. Turning now to our Dental segment, reported revenue was up 2.5% and core revenue increased 1%, as growth in our equipment and specialty consumables businesses was mostly offset by continued weakness in traditional consumables. Reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points and core operating margin was down 15 basis points. By product line, performance across our equipment and traditional consumables businesses remain consistent with what we've seen so far this year. Core revenue growth in equipment was up low single digits, while traditional consumables declined meaningfully, driven by continued inventory adjustments in the distribution channel. While we expect this inventory impact to moderate, the recent realignment of certain distributor and manufacturer relationships may have a negative impact on equipment revenues in the near term. Turning to the other half of our Dental portfolio, we were particularly pleased with our specialty consumables businesses, achieving mid-single-digit core growth across our orthodontic and implant offerings. At Nobel Biocare, core revenue growth improved to mid-single-digits. Since acquiring Nobel nearly three years ago, we made targeted growth investments to bolster our innovation capabilities and commercial execution. We've invested in a double-digit increase in our feet on the street in North America and achieved strong growth in the region during the quarter as we began to gain traction from this go-to-market initiative. We have also increased our R&D spend meaningfully and launched more than 20 new products since acquisition, delivering breakthrough technologies like our Trefoil system, a revolutionary new treatment option that significantly reduces the time required to restore the lower jaw, now making it possible to place the full restoration on the day of surgery. By providing customers with superior products on a faster launch timeline, we've enhanced Nobel's competitive position since acquisition and are delivering sustainable core growth improvements. So moving to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 8% and core revenue was up 3%, reported operating profit margin decreased 190 basis points and core operating margin was down 105 basis points. These margin declines were primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions and incremental growth investments. In product identification, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate led by strong demand for marking and coding equipment, and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offering improved sequentially and with led primarily by increased demand in China and Western Europe. Videojet core revenue increased mid-single-digits in the quarter with broad-based growth across most major product lines and geographies. Last month at Pack Expo, North America's largest packaging event, Videojet showcased six new printers and technologies including the new 6330 and 6530 Thermal Transfer Overprinters. These medium at high speed printers now feature an industry first in line print quality assurance system. The patented sensors on the inside of the printer recognized common code defects to help customers improve quality, productivity and efficiency on the packaging lines. By identifying customers workflow needs and delivering advanced technological solutions to fill those gaps. The team continues to meaningfully improved customers experiences and enhanced Videojet leadership position in the market. At Esko, core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate, driven by strength in our brand owner software and digital hardware businesses. And at X-Rite, core revenue was up low-single-digits, with strength in China and Latin America, partially offset by declines in North America. Finally, turning to Water Quality, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate with good demand in China and Western Europe, while the high growth market saw weakness primarily in Latin America. Hach's core revenue was up low-single-digit with solid performance across our core municipal and industrial end markets in North America and Western Europe, and continued growth in China. At WEFTEC, the wastewater trade show in Chicago last month, Hach launched the Claros Water Intelligence System, a platform that brings together instruments, data and process management to provide customers with valuable operational insight to manage their water processes in real time. At Hach and many of our other businesses at Danaher, we have an extensive installed base of instruments that generate a tremendous amount of data every day. Claros is a great example, how we are harnessing this information to create actionable insights for our customers, so that they can make the right decisions and be more efficient. Core revenue at Trojan declined during the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects. We are however very encouraged by healthy order trends at Trojan. Those continued to build on an increasing customer win rate. We believe this will position Trojan well to deliver better core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Finally at ChemTreat, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate during the quarter, and strength in the oil and gas, and food end markets. So to wrap-up, this is a terrific quarter performance from core revenue growth to margin expansion, EPS growth and free cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by a number of strong growth drivers across the businesses. And we'll benefit from recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex becoming part of our core revenue. One of our five core values at Danaher is we compete for shareholders, and we believe that the power of the Danaher business system combined with significant opportunities across the portfolio and our strong balance sheet positions us to create meaningful long-term value for our shareholders going forward. We are initiating fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.12 and $1.16, and expect core revenue growth to accelerate from current levels. We are raising our full-year 2017 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $3.96 to $4. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Tracey, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: Hey, good morning. Thomas Joyce : Good morning, Tycho. Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: Good quarter. I want to start off with bioprocess. I'd say there is fair amount of noise in this channel right now, just from our discussions with investors between one of the pre-announcements we saw this week, and then Roche getting hit a bit today on the biosimilar stuff. So you had double-digit biopharma order growth there, which was great to see. Can you maybe just talk through the various pieces here in your outlook? I guess, Pall was up in North America, but then you commented on the hurricane impact, and then Asia was down, so I'm just wondering on some of that discrepancy as well. Thomas Joyce : Sure, thanks, Tycho. We continue to be very positive on the bioprocess market overall. And I think the dynamics in the quarter was such that, we obviously saw the related softness on the shipment side that was associated with the hurricane impact. And those impacts were significant. But I think the order growth that we mentioned and you heard us talk about gives us great encouragement that we're going to see a meaningful acceleration in the top-line associated with biopharma in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about the overall dynamics. The hurricane impact was significant. We were shut down for two weeks in Puerto Rico. We were also shut down partially for two weeks in Florida, associated with our Beckman Life Sciences facility. And so, while the recovery has been a challenging one, we expect to get some of that production recovered in the fourth quarter, probably not all of it. Some of it will extend probably into the first quarter. But we're very confident in the positive underlying growth drivers in the bioprocessing market. Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: And have you seen any of the destocking that one of your peers mentioned this week with their pre-announcement on the customer side? Thomas Joyce : Tycho, we have seen some of that, absolutely. And we come to understand those dynamics literally on a customer-by-customer basis. And we're working through those individual customer situations. I think we have a sense of where each of them are. And we worked through like I think a good deal of that in the last quarter or two. It wouldn't be unusual, I think to see a little bit of that carry through into - through the fourth quarter, particularly given that some of those customers have facilities in Puerto Rico by the way. And so, that will take a little bit more time to work its way out, but we do think that's certainly a temporary phenomenon. Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then for the follow-up I want to ask on Dental, it's great to see Nobel bounce back here. As we think about kind of the anniversarying these destocking headwinds, can you maybe just give us a sense as to how you are thinking about that business return to growth and any color you can provide on outlook for traditional versus specialty consumables going\u2026? Thomas Joyce : Sure. Well, clearly, I think as we all know, 2017 has been a challenging year for the dental industry broadly defined, but we're actually encouraged by a number of things that we're seeing. Very encouraged by the performance in our specialty consumables business, Nobel and Ormco represent nearly half of our Dental segment. We saw mid single digit growth in the third quarter and it's possible that some of that specialty business growth in those markets are taking a little share of wallet if you will from traditional consumables. And clearly, we've seen some of the sell-out impacting sell-in, and the resulting inventory destocking. However, I would say we have a sense that there is a stabilization going on there relative to traditional consumables. There is probably - there is certainly still work to do, to realign the inventories on the equipment side, relative to some of the manufacturing distributor alignment, realignments that have gone on. So I think there is a number of things that we're very positive about and a couple of dynamics that we think we'll still need to work through. But I think in summary, if we step back from our relative performance in a challenging market, we feel really good about the execution side of what we've done. The team has done a number of things associated with our operational improvements that I think repositioned us very effectively for reinvesting in innovation and go to market that will help us in 2018. Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you. Thomas Joyce : Thanks, Tycho. Operator : And we'll go next to Scott Davis with \u200eMelius Research. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, guys. Thomas Joyce : Well, welcome back. Scott Davis : Thanks. I'm excited to be back. And, Tom, only you could talk about PELORIS 3 and get excited about a tissue product. And maybe offline you can explain to me what a tissue product actually is, but\u2026 Thomas Joyce : Glad to, Scott. But in all seriousness, we're glad to have you back, good morning. Scott Davis : Thanks. And good morning to you guys, but thank you. I'll focus in just - because I don't know how many of us industrial guys are left here, but on the industrial businesses, the - it seem like you're increasingly more excited about what you are seeing at Pall. And I assume you're more cyclical businesses like Pall Industrial, Product ID, Videojet, et cetera are setting up for a reasonably accelerating growth. Is this something your - I mean, we're seeing the macro data, but is that something you're seeing in your order books so it's leading some of your enthusiasm there? Thomas Joyce : I think there is a bit of tailwind there, Scott, in the industrial markets. But I think if you talk about businesses for example, like Videojet that mentioned, that's really more a story of outstanding execution. And it's a combination in execution between terrific new product execution, investments in go-to-market and a tremendous service footprint that creates a real competitive advantage for a business like Videojet. An area where we have seen a really strong market dynamic would perhaps be coming back to your question about Pall and the industrial side of Pall would be in microelectronics, where we see continued growth in that segment of the business, wonderful underlying dynamics, but certainly in Asia, associated with an accelerating amount of chip production associated with the sensors that are now increasingly going into whether it's the telecommunications arena, certainly the iPhone, increasing number of sensors in cars. All of those things are contributing to a pretty strong market in microelectronics. So that will be an example of something that - where there is a market tailwind. But, I think to a great extent, we're more relying on our underlying execution in our industrial businesses than we really are on the market dynamics themselves. Scott Davis : Okay, fair enough. And maybe you mentioned, I just didn't hear it, but what was the cause of margins going down in Environmental? Was it the Trojan revenue decline or is there some sort of mix issue in the quarter? Thomas Joyce : We clearly had some investments in a number of businesses around Water Quality, and a little bit of the top line softness in ChemTreat, had a little bit of impact there. ChemTreat is by the way was another one of our businesses that was impacted modestly by the hurricane. In the case of ChemTreat, it was actually impacted in Houston where we have a blending facility that had some disruption. And so, just a little bit of the mix on the top-line I think and some investments that we made in those businesses was the source of that impact. But we feel very good about how Water Quality will perform in the fourth quarter. We'll see some improvements there in the fourth quarter and we'll see some reasonable margin improvement as well. Scott Davis : Perfect. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on. Best of luck and keep up the good work. Thomas Joyce : Thanks, Scott. Daniel Comas : Thanks, Scott. Operator : And we'll go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning. Thomas Joyce : Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hey, back on bioprocess and I'm going to go over the Diagnostics for the follow-up. But on the bioprocess, can you just put a little bit more color on the orders? Are you looking at more traditional biologic manufacturers, biosimilars, or are you actually still - is it orders from some of the small-molecule people because you do sell there? And I guess, is it just - could you also parse out sort of like demand on single-use systems versus kind of traditional consumables. I'm just trying to give a little bit more color on where the demand is. Thomas Joyce : Sure. And I don't have a precise breakdown, Derik. Let me start with that caveat around the order rates from small molecule customers versus large molecule customers or even by facility on that basis. But in general, what we've seen over this year has been a reasonably balanced order book across those two segments of the bioprocessing market. Relative to your question about single-use, single-use continues to be a double-digit growth business for us, both in terms of the order book as well as what we saw actually in the top line in the third quarter. So we feel terrific about how that business is continuing to trend for us. Daniel Comas : I think part of the encouragement in the third quarter order book in the improvement as Tom noted, single-use has been strong throughout the year, including the third quarter just like some of the hurricane issues from a shipment point of view, but the order recover was more broad-based. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you. And on Diagnostics, I know it's probably too early to get a read, but are you seeing any signs at all from hospital labs on what they're purchasing patterns may look like? Order patterns may look like, as they sort of gear up for the PAMA pricing world they're facing next year? Thomas Joyce : It is too early, certainly. For those on the call it may not be quite as tuned into this reference that Derik made to PAMA. Essentially there is a dynamic going on in the market associated with reimbursement rates associated with test that are done or reimbursed on what's called the clinical lab fee schedule. Derik, it's still early days as you know even that ruling or that those recommendations associated with PAMA are in a comment period now. The industry have raised issues associated with narrow dataset that was used to compared private payer rates with the actual Medicare reimbursement rates. And so, I think, we got a little bit of time here, first of all just to wait to see how does that fee schedule ultimately gets set post the comment period. And then, I think, it's natural to assume that for the small portion of our business that is in - essentially in the outpatient environment and reimbursed through that fee schedule that there would be some pricing pressure. But pricing pressure is a natural dynamic as you know in that market and so we'll just have to wait a bit of time and we can come back to you with a little bit more of an update as things settle out. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thanks very much. Daniel Comas : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Doug Schenkel : Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Thomas Joyce : Good morning, Doug. Doug Schenkel : I guess, I want to stay on the topic of Diagnostics. You have the highest core growth rate in at least six quarters, I believe. I'm just wondering, if you would talk a little bit more about the key drivers to this improvement and specifically how much of this was from the ongoing Beckman stabilization and growth initiatives. How should we think about sustainability, especially as we are modeling out Q4 2018 and beyond? Thomas Joyce : Sure. We did have a good quarter without question in Diagnostics. We saw a really good execution certainly led by Radiometer, which delivered high-single-digit growth in the period Leica Biosystems and anatomical pathology, mid-single-digit grower, and we saw improvement in Beckman Diagnostics as well. So we feel good about that, I think we can sustain a growth rate there that certainly probably north of 3%. But Beckman does face the toughest comp that they will face this year against last year's fourth quarter. So we could see a little moderation there against that comp in the fourth quarter. But we do get Cepheid into the core, only for half the quarter, if we got it in for the full fourth quarter, we'd probably be pushing up to - probably in the 4% neighborhood for the full quarter. So we feel good about the progress we are making, Beckman is absolutely still on a journey of improvement across the number of different fronts, but we are really encouraged by the new product innovations that are coming out. We're encouraged by some of the talent infusion that we've made in that business, and certainly a great start at Cepheid and the sustained growth rates in operating margin improvements there have allowed us to continue to reinvest across the platform in R&D, and sales and marketing. Put that together with some new product innovations and we think we are setting ourselves up for some continued improvement in 2018. Doug Schenkel : Thank you for that. And that's a good segue to my next question on Cepheid. It looks like Cepheid grew 15% year-over-year, and I was looking back at our standalone Cepheid model, and the comp was actually pretty tough, I think they grew 25% year-over-year in the last year quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on with Cepheid? How much of this is a function of DBS efforts? Essentially, what inning are you in there? And well, why don't I just pause there, because I think that's the crux of the question. Thomas Joyce : Sure, sure. A terrific quarter without question, at Cepheid. Double-digit core growth, pretty balanced driven across both developed markets and the high growth markets, and most major product lines. Infectious disease, sexual health, both double-digit. Hospital acquired infections is a softer market of course, but we feel good about how we're positioned there. And so I think both geographically and from a product line perspective, we couldn't be more pleased with what's happening at Cepheid. And the investment that continues to on at Cepheid associated with innovation and new products, I think, bodes well for the future. We also continue to invest in their geographic footprint. We're building a team in China right now, it's still early days, but that team is growing nicely, and we expect to see some continued good growth in the high growth markets over time. And then relative to the impact of DBS, I mean, DBS is having an impact at Cepheid, initially around the operating margin improvements, which you saw jump up pretty significantly just in the first six months after we acquired, and we've sustained those and continue to increment those in the six months that follow. And that's really been around a number of initiatives that start with the low-hanging fruit and works then to some of the more challenging things around procurement in the supply chain both direct and indirect costs in a number of different opportunities that we've identified. In addition, DBS is having an impact on continuing to sustain the double-digit growth rate. We've implemented DBS tools associated with new product introductions to become more efficient and more timely in those new product introductions and introduce products with the highest possible quality right at launch. So I think, there's a number of different areas, and if I step back for a second, I'd say one of the most encouraging thing is how readily the tools of the Danaher Business System have been adopted by that team. It's been just terrific to see they have chosen those tools that make the biggest impact on the business, and it put them to work I think in the areas that made the most sense in terms of overall performance. So good to go, we look forward to another good year next year. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thanks for all that detail. And congrats on a good quarter and all the progress. Thomas Joyce : Thanks, Doug. Operator : And we'll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Joyce : Good morning, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks and good morning, hey, guys. I'll throw two. They're a little bit more financially oriented, here real quick. One maybe more of a Dan question, one maybe more of a Tom question. Dan, I wonder, now that we have clarity post Veris on some of the cost savings, how you are thinking about those cost savings is contributive to the margin profile for the Diagnostics business next year. Does that drop through? Do we split that between incremental reinvest by - reinvestment on the commercial side. How should we think about the Veris savings as accretive to margins? And then, for Tom\u2026 Thomas Joyce : Okay. Go ahead, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Sorry. For Tom, on the last call you introduced or perhaps reintroduced some parameters in terms of how you think about what makes an attractive acquisition target. I wonder, if you could just give us a sense for as you - maybe a little bit more active, given where we are relative to the balance sheet and thinking about what the right thing is to do with that capital? How do you think the environment has evolved in terms of the potential returns on capital, and how those might be different between smaller versus larger assets? Thanks so much. Daniel Comas : Steve, I'll kick off, yeah. We're tracking pretty well as we go into next year with an expectation of about $40 million of costs coming out of the Beckman P&L, because of what we've done here with Veris. We are taking a portion of it, probably close to half of that number, and investing that in Cepheid. As you know, we're going to - they're going to take over kind of broader molecular effort here, and we think that investment will help them accelerate some of their activities. Thomas Joyce : Thanks, Dan. Steve, associated with your question on M&A. First in terms of the environment, I'd say we've seen some modest improvement in activity around deal opportunities. So that gives us some encouragement that there's opportunities perhaps breaking free, but we'll see always hard to predict. Relative to our viewpoint on acquisitions, we have always valued the balance between small and mid-size bolt-on acquisitions that are really accretive both strategically and financially to our platforms. Balanced with larger acquisitions that sometimes add a new leg or an adjacency to a platform or occasionally in our history that have added a new platform. As I've said in the past, our focus really is on the five platforms we have today and looking at adjacencies that might materially improve those platforms as they exist. From a priority standpoint, we always prioritize markets first, and we look for attractive global markets with good growth dynamics. And then we look at companies secondarily, and we look for companies with good growth dynamics and margin opportunities. We certainly value the consumables and the aftermarket side of companies. You've seen us build the portfolio now into the 60 - 65% of the portfolio is in consumables, and that obviously is a key source of underlying growth and stability, a lack of cyclicality and inherently good gross margins. And so we remain very consistent, I think, in those views of what markets and companies are attractive. And then finally, we look at valuation. And we've always valued a disciplined approach to returns. We've consistently said that small and mid-size bolt-on acquisitions, we look for those double-digit returns to be in - roughly a three year timeframe. And then if we're talking about a larger acquisition or an adjacency those double-digit returns still remain vitally important, but the timeframe associated with those maybe a bit longer. Historically, we've targeted inside of a five-year timeframe. Occasionally, those get a hair longer than that, when the strategic value and the long-term opportunity really warrants it. So I would say, our views in terms of the characteristics we look for and the approach, we've taken remain very consistent with our history. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks, Tom. Really appreciate the refresher there. Thomas Joyce : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven Winoker : Thanks. Good morning all. Daniel Comas : Hey, hey, look who is back. Welcome. Steven Winoker : Yeah, Scott and I'll take those every time we can. Thomas Joyce : Hey, Steve. How are you doing? Steven Winoker : Good. How are you? Thomas Joyce : I'm good. Thanks. Thanks for joining. Steven Winoker : Pleasure. Thanks for having me. So listen, just moving back to a couple of topics you already hit on, but I like to go a little further. I remember, when you guys first purchased Beckman. We were really talking about mid-single-digit growth over a long timeframe. So you've seen mid-to-high, and you've seen obviously improvement, right, from flat to low. I'm sure Florida took a little bit of a chunk out. But if you had to kind of point to - has your expectation there changed, shifted? Is there something fundamental? Or it's just all been just a temporary issue that you're kind of working through, and you really believe the growth is there? Thomas Joyce : Steve, your recollection is a good one. And we do - did and do have a view that Beckman Coulter, the acquisition that we did those years ago, has the potential to become a mid-single-digit growth business, and we would obviously see to drive that beyond that but particularly as we broaden the exposure to certain end markets, like the molecular market, which Beckman obviously did not have exposure to in the past, and where Cepheid now plays such an important role. And it has been a journey, one thing I would maybe remind everybody is that the Beckman Coulter that we acquired was then initially split into two different businesses. And our Diagnostics business became a separate business from our Life Science business. Beckman Coulter Life Science, we often described in those days as an $800 million start-up that we had to kind of take from a flat to declining business and drive to growth. We've done that very successfully Beckman Coulter Life Science has become an innovator in its market and has now driven consistent mid-single-digit growth and great operating margin improvements. And so, we're really pleased with that. On the Dx side, it's been a longer journey. There was a pretty significant inheritance tax that we had to pay, and have continued to have to pay associated with lack of innovation, some quality and regulatory related matters, and frankly, long sales cycles, and frankly, long customer memories. And those have been a challenge for us. We're really pleased with the progress that we've made, taking that flat Dx business, probably actually - probably on its way to declining slightly, and improving it, and improving the operating margins and driving working capital improvements, improving retention rates and win rates. But it's been a long journey and there is still a journey to go. And so, we still believe that the opportunities there are significant and we'll see continuous improvement. But it's been slow going, but we're confident in the improvement potential ahead. Daniel Comas : And, Steve, to add to the point, if you put the two Beck together, for example, in the third quarter, they were combined mid single digit growers with a lot of margin expansion. Steven Winoker : Okay. That's helpful. Second on Environmental and Applied Solutions, you talked about it a little bit. But I would have thought in the constructive environment that is out there today and given some of the secular tailwinds behind some of the newer parts of that business, that's relatively newer, that you would have seen better than 3% growth core. So again, maybe just talk a little bit about what's going on in terms of the ability to accelerate that even a little. And also, kind of adjacencies as you sort of look at that business and think about kind of adjacent paths that might also supplement forward organic growth after the acquisition's anniversary. Thomas Joyce : Sure, thanks, Steve. So, important to separate EAS into Product Id and Water Quality, so Product ID remained very solid, mid-single-digit growth in the period, continued outstanding performance from Videojet and good performance from both Esko and X-Rite. I'll come to those relative to your adjacency question in just a minute. But on the Water Quality side, in the third quarter we were little lighter on the core growth side, a low-single-digit growth. Hach showed improvement in - relative to the second quarter and - but we still saw some softness in the environmental business. But again, we firmly believe and we understand that that's more project timing. The muni and industrial side of Hach continues to perform very well. The other dynamic in the quarter, relative to Water Quality was, again, really around project timing at Trojan. Trojan has seen terrific growth - order growth rates this year and good top line performance. In the quarter, we just simply saw some project delays and - but we saw double-digit orders and we think there is actually pretty good potential that Trojan might show double-digit core growth in the fourth quarter. And again, a little bit of a shortfall at ChemTreat related to the Hurricane impact, but ChemTreat has been a very consistent performer. So I think to step back from all that at the Environmental and Applied Solutions segment and we would say we feel very good about the performance there. The underlying order rates are good and we'll see improved performance in the fourth quarter. Relative to your question about adjacencies, I think those two platforms underneath that segment are actually great examples of how we have extended a platform through acquisitions into adjacencies and broadened the number of solutions we bring to customers. If you think about how we broadened Water Quality originally with the extension into treatment at Trojan and into ChemTreat, and ChemTreat how it was accretive to our growth rate, I think great examples. I think Product ID as we extended Videojet back into packaging workflow, all the way back to the brand owner designing that packaging with Esko and X-Rite and Pantone. I mean, those are just textbook examples of how we think about expanding the platform and improving growth rates and the - and our strategic heft if you will. And so, those are good models. We would attempt to continue to extend those models. Again, it's all a question of cultivating the right targets and eventually breaking them free. But we have active pipelines in each one of the businesses that, each one of the platforms to do just that. Steven Winoker : Great, very helpful, guys, I look forward to working together going forward. Bye. Thomas Joyce : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Thomas Joyce : Hey, Jeff, good morning. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Hey, just a couple of quick follow-ons, one back to water. Tom, your confidence on that Q4 timing, I asked that kind of in the spirit that we are hearing about some delays in other pockets in muni work. I'm wondering if these projects that didn't start in Q3 have already started in Q4, I mean, it sounds like the orders and backlog are there. But I guess just to address the risk of potential further push-out. And then secondly, just as we think about your comments back on Dental or maybe equipment now stepping down, I would assume that's going to create some absorption issues in the plants and maybe some other ripple effects, just what are the ramifications for Dental margins in Q4 when you look that swirl of kind of specialized consumables little better and maybe equipment taking a step down? Thomas Joyce : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. So relative to water in the fourth quarter, we do feel good about water in the fourth quarter associated with the order rates that we mentioned. Your question specifically about project delays, I mean, to some extent there is - that's always a dynamic that can exist in the muni market, but when we're in as close as we are right now, usually we have a pretty good sense, for example, at Trojan in terms of what's going to ship when relative to construction schedules and those kinds of things. Some of what has gone on in our, what we call, our environmental business, which is more associated with government funding and releasing tenders associated with more natural resources like rivers, lakes and streams and monitoring of deep ocean, that's where I think it can be a little bit more uncertain. So balancing all that, I think we have pretty good line of sight to the fourth quarter. Sure, there can always be one thing or another that gets pushed out. But in general or on balance across ChemTreat, Trojan, Hach and the broader portfolio, again, we feel pretty good about where we are. Relative to your question about Dental equipment, this is an uncertain environment in terms of some of the manufacturer/distributor realignment that I mentioned, and the potential impact on equipment. So, I mean, I think we dialed in our outlook reasonably conservatively and we manage the cost structures in the factor associated with the volumes that we see coming, so\u2026 Daniel Comas : And, Jeff, maybe to add to that, so the equipment side, we will have a couple of tough quarters here, because of what is likely to be a destock in the equipment side. And that will hurt the equipment margin. I still think we get an offset, because we've gone through this destock period on the traditional consumables and we feel like we're kind of getting towards the end of that. And if anything, consumables are more profitable than equipment. So as Tom said, I think it will probably align, equipments going to get tougher on the margin side, but consumable - traditional consumables will start to see some recovery here in Q4. Jeff Sprague : Okay, great. Thank you. Thomas Joyce : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And we'll go next to Dan Arias with Citi. Thomas Joyce : Good morning, Dan. Daniel Arias : Hey, good morning. Thank you. Maybe just on Diagnostics on the topic of the selling environment, if I think back to the beginning of the last year, it kind of sounded like you weren't really sure whether ACA and everything associated with that were material factors. So I guess, as we push through the year, I'm curious what your thoughts are there. Do you feel like health reform issues are affecting demand, or is it more of the - it is sort of the fringe element that's not really impactful on results? Thomas Joyce : Dan, it is hard to pin down. There is no doubt that the backing and forthing in Washington associated with ACA creates uncertainty in the minds of our customers and uncertainty is never good as we all know. And it creates a little bit of hesitancy, not in all customers, but in some customers, but it's hard to pin down the materiality of that. I mean, there are a couple of things, there is one in particular that is a little bit easier to pin down and that's med device tax. If ACA is repealed as it's been proposed a number of times, the med device tax typically would - it has been - would go out the window permanently. It's been in suspense so far all this year. That had a really very, very modest impact on us, both when it came into being, then when it went into suspense. So, I mean, but that's a more practical and specific example, but again, the materiality of the uncertainty, very hard to pin. Daniel Arias : Okay, helpful. And maybe just to finish off that last point, with Dental forecast, unless I missed it, do the puts and takes there net out at Dental, core growth staying up modestly to finish the year or is that not necessarily something we should count on? Thanks. Daniel Comas : I think the planning assumption we had going into the second half of being Dental relatively flat, granted we were up kind of 1% here in the third quarter, is a good planning assumption for the fourth quarter. But as we talked about more broadly, we expect accelerating core growth in the fourth quarter. We talked about Pall, we talked about the inclusion of Cepheid. We expect water to get better. So for us the 3% we posted here in the third quarter, we think we'd be looking more to 3.5% to 4% range from core growth in Q4. Daniel Arias : Okay, thanks. Thomas Joyce : Thanks, Dan. Operator : That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt Gugino for any closing or additional remarks. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Tracey. And thanks everyone for joining. We're around all day for questions. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Before we get in to the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to touch briefly on the announcement we made this morning regarding our CFO transition plan. As I\u2019m sure many of you saw, we announced that Matt McGrew, our current Group CFO of our diagnostics and dental platforms will succeed Dan Comas as Chief Financial Officer of Danaher on January 1 of 2019. Dan will continue on as an Executive Vice President and a member of the office of the Chief Executive post January 1, 2019, as he begins a gradual transition to retirement. Dan, it goes without saying that it has been and will continue to be a privilege working with you. For the past 27 years, all of us at Danaher have valued your outstanding financial stewardship, thoughtful guidance and longtime friendship. Danaher would not be where it is today without your leadership, strategic vision, and humility. We are also very pleased that you\u2019ll continue to work with us post-2018 to ensure a seamless CFO transition and provide a strategic counsel we value so highly.  Many of you know Matt McGrew from his time as Vice President of Investor Relations. But Matt has had a number of important roles during his past 14 years with Danaher. Matt is uniquely qualified to take on the positon of CFO, as he will be able to leverage his extensive Danaher experience in internal audit, M&A, investor relations and as Group CFO with operational experience across four of our five platforms. Throughout his tenure with Danaher, Matt has consistently demonstrated superior leadership and played an integral role in the company\u2019s growth both organically and inorganically. We look forward to helping Matt transition to this important role with Dan\u2019s guidance and strategic counsel.  With that lets\u2019 get to our results. We are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter performance, as the team delivered 5.5% core revenue growth, solid margin expansion and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. These results capped a solid year for Danaher and we\u2019re very encouraged by the momentum we built throughout 2017. 2017 was a great example of how we run the Danaher playbook. We improved gross margins to nearly 56%, lowered G&A, increased our investments in sales and marketing and R&D to drive accelerating core growth, all while delivering 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion. This operating model continues to demonstrate how we build a better, stronger Danaher.  For the full year, our differentiated portfolio, organic growth investments and good commercial execution helped drive 3.5% core revenue growth, including mid-single digit growth in three out of our four reporting segments. Our total annual revenues are now nearly $18.5 billion. We generated $2.9 billion of free cash flow in 2017, resulting in mid-teens growth year-on-year that helps position us for more significant capital deployment in 2018. Our free cash-to-net income conversion ratio was 117%, and 2017 represents the 26th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. From an M&A perspective, we deployed nearly $400 million of capital in 2017 on 10 strategic bolt-on acquisitions, each of which will help enhance their respective platforms. We also remain encouraged by the great performance at our most recently acquired larger businesses, Cepheid, Phenomenex, PALL and Nobel Biocare.  Turning now to the fourth quarter, sales grew 11% to $5.1 billion, as the impact of currency translation increased revenue by 3% and acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%. Core revenue increased 5.5%, led by four of our five platforms that grew between 5.5% and 7.5%.  Geographically high growth markets grew high single digits with China and India continuing to lead the way. In developed markets, we saw acceleration as both the US and Western Europe were up mid-single digits.  Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.8%, an increase of 130 basis points, while core operating margin expanded 105 basis points led by our life sciences and diagnostics platforms. These margin results are a testament to our teams\u2019 consistent execution using the tools of the Danaher business system. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.19, bringing full year adjusted EPS to $4.03 both representing double digit growth year-on-year. Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue was up 12% and core revenue grew 7.5%, which marks the platforms highest quarterly core growth rate in over four years. Life sciences operating profit margin was 20%, with both core and reported operating margins increasing over 300 basis points. This increase was broad based across the platform driven primarily by outstanding DBS execution, new product innovations and better than expected topline performance. Beckman Life Sciences delivered high single digit core revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, led by ongoing strong performance in our Flow Cytometry and particle counting businesses. We believe the Beckman team continues to take market share driven by improved commercial execution and new product innovations.  Over the past three years, Beckman has refreshed its portfolio launching approximately 20 new products. Several of these new products address higher growth areas such as biologic and genomic work flows, setting the business up well for continued strong performance.  Leica Microsystem\u2019s core revenue was up low single digits, led by growth in Western Europe and China, primarily in the medical and research end markets. Core revenue at Sciex increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by continued strength in the food, environmental and pharmaceutical end markets. In addition, Phenomenex had a very good quarter, growing core revenue high single digits as both Sciex and Phenomenex are starting to leverage each other\u2019s go-to-market capabilities.  At Pall, core revenue grew nearly 10%, its best quarterly growth rate since we acquired the business as our microelectronics and single use technologies businesses continued to perform very well. In addition, biopharma and process and industrial finished the year on a strong note, as these businesses rebounded nicely from the hurricane disruptions that impacted third quarter results.  In October, our life sciences platform successfully closed the acquisition of IDBS, a software informatics leader in the life science space. IDBS\u2019s software provides a data management platform enabling its research customers to better capture, manage and report on scientific insights. This platform in combination with our life sciences instrumentation will enable researches to accelerate their innovation efforts helping to make better and faster scientific decisions.  Moving now to diagnostics, reported revenues increased 13.5% and core revenue increased 6%. Core operating margin grew by 105 basis points and reported operating margin increased 690 basis points to 19.5%. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew at low single digit rate led by solid growth in our immunoassay, urinalysis and clinical chemistry product lines. Regionally the growth was driven by China and Latin America.  At Radiometer, core revenue increased mid-single digits in the quarter, as both our blood gas and AQT product lines continued to perform well. Leica Biosystems delivered high single digit core revenue growth, led by increased demand in both our advanced staining and core histology product lines. Growth was broad based across most regions, with particular strength in North America and Western Europe.  Turning to Cepheid, the team had an outstanding quarter. Core revenue increased greater than 25% driven by growth in all major product lines and geographies. For the full year 2017, Cepheid\u2019s core revenue grew approximately 20%, which is almost double the expected rate from when we announced the acquisition. This outperformance was driven by a combination of strong commercial execution, test menu expansion and an ever increasing installed base of instruments.  Overall it was a tremendous first year at Cepheid, with DBS helping to deliver improvements across the company. Since we acquired the business last November, Cepheid has achieved 400 basis points of gross margin expansion, increased operating margins from just above breakeven in to the mid-teens and improved on-time delivery by over 1500 basis points. The team has also meaningfully embraced two key commercial DBS growth tools, transformative marketing and funnel management. These tools have helped Cepheid expand its market visibility, generate more potential leads and increase the number of new customers they are serving. As a result, we believe Cepheid continues to expand its leading market position and gain market share.  Turning to our dental segment, reported revenue increased 2.5% and core revenue was down slightly. Dental operating profit margin was 13.1% as both core and reported operating margins declined. By product line, performance was in line with our expectations. Growth in our specialty consumables businesses, implants and orthodontics was offset by declines in equipment and traditional consumables.  As expected the declines in traditional consumable growth rate has started to moderate, however, our equipment business was negatively impacted by the recent realignment of certain distributor and manufacture relationships. We anticipate these difficult market conditions to persist through the first half of 2018.  We continue to be pleased with the performance in our specialty consumables businesses. Nobel Biocare in particular had a great quarter, growing core revenue high single digits driven by North America and China. December marked the three-year anniversary of the Nobel acquisition, and they\u2019ve made tremendous progress.  Not only has the team meaningfully improved operating margins, but has also increased R&D spend by approximately 20%, launched more than 25 new products and increased their sales force by 15% over the past two years. These growth initiatives along with the execution of DBS tools to streamline sales from our proxies and increase new customer starts has helped Nobel pose mid-single digit core growth in each of the last two years.  Moving now to our environmental and applied solutions segment, reported revenue grew 12.5% with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin declined by 50 basis points and reported operating margin decreased to 23.1%, driven primarily by increased productivity initiatives and a deafening spend within our water quality platform.  In product identification, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by strong demand from marking and coating equipment and related consumables. The out-growth in our packaging and color solutions offerings was attributed to increased demand in North America and Western Europe. Videojet core revenue increased high single digits in the quarter, with broad based growth across most major product lines and geographies. The fourth quarter capped off another great year for Videojet as the business continued to compound returns and gain market share. Over the past five years, Videojet has averaged mid-single digit core revenue growth, continued to expand margins and also completed a number of strategic Bolton acquisitions. One of those acquisitions Laetus had its best quarter of core revenue growth since we acquired the business in 2015. As a reminder Laetus is a leading supplier of track and trade inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants.  With the help of DBS tools Laetus has generated greater market awareness and demand within the pharmaceutical tracking vertical and we believe is well positioned for growth going forward. In our packaging and color solutions businesses, core revenue at Esko was up mid-single digits, while X-Rite was up low-single digits. Finally, turning to our quality, core revenue growth for the platform at a mid-single digit rate. Hach had its best quarter of the year, with core revenue growing mid-single digits. This growth was drive by solid performance across our core municipal and industrial end markets, with strength in Western Europe and China.  Hach also continued its healthy cadence of Bolton acquisitions, closing two deals in the quarter, AppliTek and Kipp & Zonen. AppliTek is a leading provider of wet chemistry process analyzers and integrated systems that will help Hach offer a broader suite of parameters to its core industrial and municipal customers. Kipp & Zonen specializes in making instrumentation that\u2019s relied upon by meteorologist through applications such as climate research, water resource management and materials testing.  Kipp & Zonen will join Hach\u2019s environmental business and nicely complement our existing offerings, providing us an opportunity to deliver enhanced customer solutions. We are excited to welcome both teams to Danaher.  At Chemtreat, core revenue grew at a low single digit rate, driven by increases in the food, steel and oil and gas end markets, primarily in North America. It\u2019s worth noting that 2017 marks Chemtreat\u2019s 50th consecutive year of revenue growth, a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team\u2019s commitment to continue its improvement and their best-in-class commercial execution. Lastly, Trojan had a great quarter delivering double digit core growth, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market. Trojan continues to execute very well significantly improving customer win rates to help drive share gains relative to its markets.  So to wrap up, we\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter results, capping off a good year for Danaher and helping to build momentum as we start 2018. In 2017, the team delivered double digit adjusted EPS growth; meaningful margin improvement and cash flow generation and saw core revenue growth accelerate through the year.  We also executed on a number of strategic Bolton acquisitions, continued to focus on integration of our recent larger deals and we now have a balance sheet that positions us well for a more significant capital deployment in 2018. As we look ahead, we believe that the strength of our portfolio, combined with the power of the Danaher business system provide us with the foundation to achieve long term shareholder value creation. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.90 and $0.93, which assumer core growth of 3.5% to 4%.  We continue to expect full year 2018 core revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% and adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.25 and $4.35. Matt Gugino : Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Tracey, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Let\u2019s step back just a bit, the step up in core growth was pretty exceptional really, but can you walk us around the world, I wasn\u2019t clear where the positive surprises came from globally. By business it was clear, but let\u2019s clear globally. Tom Joyce : Scott it was really very positive on a global basis. Of course I think we all know from a macro perspective we\u2019re in a unique time, right, we\u2019re in a time of globally synchronous economic expansion. And I think in many respects our businesses are well positioned to take advantage of that growth rate on a global basis across all the many markets in which we participate.  What we saw in the fourth quarter was continued good performance in the high growth markets, with exceptional growth in China, in India, as we\u2019d seen consistently throughout the course of the year, some improving performance in places like Latin America and Russia, and frankly still some softness in places like the Middle East.  But I think what was maybe a bit more noteworthy than the continued good performance in the high growth markets was the incremental strength that we saw in the developed markets. In the US and in Europe both of those markets up mid-single digits is I think where the real difference is on a global basis. Now clearly our businesses were well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in each of those markets. We saw obviously particular strength in our life science businesses and our diagnostic businesses, up north of 7% and 6% respectively, improved performance sequentially in our water quality business which we expected, and consistent performance in product identification.  So I think overall pretty well in line with what\u2019s happening in the macro from a geographic perspective, but I think clearly four to five platforms incredibly well positioned relative to those macro drivers. Scott Davis : So that just begs the natural question of when you think about your guidance 3.5% to 4%. That first half of the year you\u2019ve got reasonably easy comps and you made positive comments about the global macro. Is there something you\u2019ve seen January that leads to be a little bit more conservative or is this just the standard Danaher, it\u2019s still early in the year, let\u2019s wait and see before we raise that guidance. Tom Joyce : I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s anything in particular that we\u2019ve seen on a near-term basis Scott. I think it\u2019s much more to the latter point you made, which is it\u2019s very early in the year. We are encouraged by obviously the finish we saw. What little we\u2019ve seen of January to this point gives us encouragement as well. And I think it\u2019s just early at this point and obviously we\u2019ll be updating throughout the course of the year. But I think for now we feel very good about the guidance that we have and we\u2019ll watch carefully as this quarter unfolds. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Question on in terms of the delta relative to our model life science certainly stood out. You called out Beckman life science, Phenomenex. Can you quantify what Pall life sciences was up and then was there any catchup affect from 3Q there that you can quantify and any budget flush dynamic that you\u2019re willing to call out. Tom Joyce : So our best stance was the life science was up 7.5%, there was probably about a point benefit, kind of a hurricane recovery, so call it ex hurricane recovery more like 6.5%. That was also followed through with very strong orders. We were I think as we went into the beginning in January slightly worried that there were some budget flush, but our January orders have remained very strong. That\u2019s not only life science but more broadly. Tycho Peterson : And then a question on Cepheid, obviously this has done incredibly well. I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on how much of this is coming from new cartridge launches versus flu trends versus [HVDC][ph] and some of these other markets. Tom Joyce : We saw a really broad based strong performance from Cepheid. There were a number of factors that I think contributed to that. Not the least of which certainly was enhanced commercial execution. One of the things we tracked at Cepheid is our installed base and our new customer addition, and since we\u2019ve acquired the business, new customer additions are plus 15% since we acquired the business.  I think menu is certainly a contributor with Xpress flu, with Flu/RSV, with strep test all introduced in 2017, all making a difference. Yes, continued strength in the hybrid in developing countries but very good strength in the developed markets as well. Clearly we are in the midst of at least certainly from a patient perspective a very challenging flu season.  And yes that does drive growth at Cepheid. But I think if you step back and you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, that performance is driven far beyond the early strength of the flu season and really represents I think a number of both commercial execution enhancement and menu expansions that have driven growth in the installed base. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Maybe on dental right, some of the underlying trends particularly in the recently acquired business and Nobel seems better, but obviously some of the noise still exist with the channel and maybe on sort of basic consumables. I guess based on what you\u2019ve seen kind of closing the year to start of the year. I mean in terms of cadence and in terms of your thoughts on how some of the changes you\u2019ve made over time are starting to playout and the pieces where you\u2019ve been able to influence it versus maybe some of the market factors you don\u2019t have control on. And what\u2019s your sort of updated thoughts on how that\u2019s gone and in terms of maybe some of the small wins it seems like you\u2019re getting in pieces like Nobel. Tom Joyce : The fourth quarter played out pretty much in line with what we expected. I think we all know that 2017 was clearly a difficult year in the industry. But there are a number of things that actually are quite encouraging for us. Starting with especially consumables business, I mentioned in my comments earlier the terrific performance that we\u2019ve seen in Nobel. We\u2019ve seen very consistent and good performance from Ormco as well.  And those two businesses especially consumables businesses represent half our dental segment. Mid-single digit growth across that group of businesses combined in the fourth quarter with Nobel being high single digits, and there\u2019s no question I think those are some pretty attractive markets to participate in.  Could the strength there be taken a little bit of wallet share from some of the more traditional consumables, maybe a little bit tough to pinpoint on that, but in general that half of our segment we were quite encouraged by? High growth markets have continued to perform very well, high single digit growth in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017. And then operational execution, you know we\u2019ve talked in the past and I think we\u2019ve just finished up our second year of talking about our dental platform, approaching the dental platform as a new acquisition. And we\u2019ve done a number of things to right size the cost structure while we invest in over the last couple of years.  We consolidated operating companies from 10 down to four, reduced the manufacturing and back office sites by over nearly a third. Gross margins are up a 100 basis points as a result of a number of those changes and yet we\u2019re still reinvesting. R&D up a 100 basis points as a percent of sales, up 20% in 2017 year-on-year, a whole bunch of new products, 25 new products as I mentioned in Nobel.  So this is a $3 billion platform we have today and admittedly that doesn\u2019t represent an enormous percentage of Danaher and clearly where we\u2019ve seen the weakness in about half of that platform isn\u2019t even a smaller percentage of the overall platform. But these are strong brands and great franchises. Good secular trends around digital dentistry and so on and over all we feel good about the operational improvements and the progress we\u2019re making and we continue to drive to create long term value out of that platform. Ross Muken : That\u2019s super helpful and maybe just on the capital allocation front. So you guys free cash continues to be a really tremendous 100% plus of net income. I guess as you\u2019re staring out over the balance of the year, it looks like the leverage levels are going to get back because of manageable place. How are you balancing kind of your balance sheet capacity versus public market multiples, looks like you were a little bit busy on the tuck-in side in the last quarter or two. So help us just think through kind of how that environment looks like for you right now? Tom Joyce : We feel very good about where we sit today Ross. The 10 acquisitions that we did in the past year were strategic enhancements to a number of our platforms, and the spend that we executed during the course of the year was certainly within the range of the spend that we anticipated during the course of the year, particularly in light of the capital deployment that had preceded that over the couple of years of \u201915 and \u201916. As we enter 2018, as I mentioned, I think the balance sheet\u2019s in great shape. It positions us now to take advantage of opportunities as they come along. Optimally we would deploy that capital at or above our free cash flow and for deals that really are strategically important to anyone of our platforms today, we\u2019d be willing to stretch that a bit.  So we feel great about how we enter the year. We\u2019ve seen activity pick up a little bit. Second half of the year you saw a little bit more activity in those boltons in the first half of the year, and I think that bodes well for how things might open up here with people feeling good about their own valuations clearly as sellers.  But I think it\u2019s also probably worth noting that now the tax reform has been determined, if you will. That pays a level of uncertainty out of the market, and anytime you eliminate uncertainty, confidence grows and that may help things out as well. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven Winoker : Dan could you maybe give a little more color on the puts and takes around the gross margin, 130 basis points. Obviously you guys are less sensitive in your cost structure to material inflation than a lot of other companies. But maybe just talk about the price productivity mix impact versus other headwinds. Dan Comas : You\u2019re right. I mean all up a big part of the driver is the continued expansion of gross margins at Pall. It\u2019s obviously been a multi-year effort. The big step-up, the 400 basis points step up in gross margin at Cepheid is year-on-year are probably the two biggest drivers. We had a 55% gross margin; we just don\u2019t have that much impact from sort of commodities and direct labor inflation. It\u2019s a little bit of a headwind right now, but at t hose levels it\u2019s relatively modest. And clearly when you\u2019re putting together 5.5% core growth, you get very good fall through including on the gross margin side. Steven Winoker : And so you expect that to continue? Dan Comas : Yes, probably not at the \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get another 400 basis points step up at Cepheid next year in gross margin, but I think we\u2019re very well positioned from gross margin. And I think as we saw on the operating margin side, as many of you\u2019ll remember, we had negative OMX, core OMX in the first quarter of this year and we still ended up at the high end of our range of 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion. I feel very good about how we are set up in terms of core margin falling in to \u201918 including some of the actions we took in the latter part of \u201917. Steven Winoker : And then maybe just talk through a little more of the margin dynamics gotten it down 50 basis points at Environmental & Applied Solutions. Dan Comas : Sure, that was primarily a couple of different factors, Trojan being very strong, a little bit of a negative mix. But the water business particularly Hach came to us kind of early in the fourth quarter with some opportunities both on the growth side and on the cost side to take some actions. It was clear we were having a very good quarter. We let them execute upon those actions both top and bottom line. You did see their growth accelerate. I just saw it for January they had a very strong start to the year. So I think some of their growth investments are still paying off pretty quickly here.  So I\u2019m not concerned. A fair amount of it was kind of orchestrated through the course, given the strength we had. And again we\u2019re not going to have the uplift we have in that segment that we will continue to have in diagnostics and dental. But I think you\u2019ll see more normalized margin improvement across those businesses.  And [PID] had a very good quarter in terms of year, in terms of margins. And I think you\u2019ll see water sort of back on track here starting earlier this year. Operator : And we\u2019ll next go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Just a couple of things, just back to tax reform, you guys obviously do a fair amount of boltons and just looking at this provision on deals that are structured as asset deals where you can get immediate expensing of the fixed assets of the target company. I just wondered if you could give us a little context from a Danaher standpoint. On a lot of your bolton deals, typically asset deals and you have the ability to structure them that way, and kind of change the economic lunge you\u2019re looking through when you look at these properties. Tom Joyce : Jeff there\u2019s always been an advantage to acquire the assets as oppose to the stock of an entity, perhaps even more so now. I would say that we\u2019re sort of incrementally encouraged versus where we were two months ago generally wrapped around tax reform. We said in December we thought our rate would be 21%. I think it will be probably close to 20% to 21% this year.  We talked about a toll tax being probably in the magnitude of 100 million a year for the next five years. We now think it\u2019s going to be more like 50 million to 60 million. So it\u2019s still like sort of incrementally, and finally to your point, as often been the case, often with acquisitions particularly asset acquisitions there is an opportunity to do even more tax work to potentially lower that ETR even more overtime. Jeff Sprague : And then on the investment spend in Environmental and Applied, just wondering is that kind of traditional or restructuring or you\u2019re doing something further drive growth. Obviously the tempo when the business seems like its quite strong, I guess there\u2019s always some belt tightening to do around the edges. But is this more growth oriented or is it more restructuring oriented? Tom Joyce : It\u2019s little bit of both, more growth oriented, Hach adding both on the R&D side and the feet on the street side. We\u2019re seeing very good numbers on the municipal and the industrial side, they actually got better through the year and we gave some latitude to ramp it up even more in Q4. Jeff Sprague : And then finally just on the distributor realignment in dental. Are we just now kind of working through the comparisons associated with the growth realignment that happened in the last several months or so, six months or so, maybe it\u2019s longer than that? And so we\u2019re just kind of working through the annualization of these dynamics or is there still somethings shifting around in the business? Tom Joyce : Jeff those relationships changed in a formal way at the beginning last year. So we\u2019re about four or five months in two what is a shift in largely exclusive arrangements that involved our relationship with Henry Schein and Dentsply Sirona\u2019s relationship with Patterson. Essentially changing places in terms of a number of equipment related product line particularly around imaging.  When that sort of thing happens, there\u2019s a series of adjustments that need to be made. Some of that comes in the form of inventory, some of that comes in the form of actually sell-out that is associated with sales team, learnings new products, shifting incentives etcetera which can further, along with the inventory adjustment have an impact on sell-in. So it\u2019s a series of factors that come together that does take a number of months to work its way through the system. At the end of the day the market becomes a little more of a level playing field when you have less exclusive arrangements between manufacturers and distributors. We believe that it will still take better part of the first half of this year for those adjustments to work their way through the system.  In the meantime, we are encouraged by seeing the traditional consumable side, which has been challenged as well moderate a bit in the fourth quarter. We take that altogether and we still think our dental business is likely to be flattish in the first half of this year with the specially tool of business is continuing to perform quite well, the high growth markets continue to perform quite well and much of the operational improvement that we\u2019re putting in place continuing to improve profitability. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin : Just got a couple, one quick one and then one follow-up. So net interest expense, interest expense, so what\u2019s the guide for \u201918 could you remind me? Dan Comas : 145 million. Derik De Bruin : And could you talk a little bit about pharma demand. I mean we\u2019re starting to see some big companies talking about increasing their capital allocations and spending. Could you sort of talk about what you sort of see in the pharma space and sort of order pick-ups in that area on the equipment side or what\u2019s on the bio process side? I\u2019m wondering if some of the stuff you\u2019re seeing directly weighted to some of the commentary that we\u2019re hearing on them stepping up on those spend. Tom Joyce : We feel good about the overall pharma market today, not just in bio-processing, in biologic demand pharma demand, but across more molecules as well. And we would point to the continued good performance in our equipment businesses at Sciex, at Beckman Life Science, at Phenomenex, at Leica Microsystem. Each of those businesses on the equipment side continuing to perform very well, and not all of those businesses have a significant exposure to the biologic side of life science or certainly pharma as we do say at Pall, where by the way we saw some improved performance clearly in the fourth quarter, obviously not all a function of the recovery from the third quarter hurricane disruptions but in fact we saw good order rate trends around biologic and small molecules, good order rate trend around our single use technologies as well. So on balance I would say, the overall pharma market, biologics and small molecules combined continues to be in pretty good shape. Derik De Bruin : And the diagnostics side, any possible CapEx or any PAMA blow back? Tom Joyce : Not really. Derik, again early relative to PAMA those rates as you know are just going in to place. As I mentioned previously, our exposure there is relatively modest with 60%of our volume outside the United States, this being only a US impact and limited to Medicare reimbursements for outpatient spending which again further mitigates the impact on us.  It\u2019s certainly reasonable to think that customers will leverage the reduction and reimbursement associated with PAMA more broadly, but then again, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily anything new. I think anytime there are competitive dynamics in a market like the diagnostics market certainly in the central lab there\u2019s going to be some pricing pressure, PAMA will create a little bit of an additional rationale for that. But on a fact basis the exposure there, again US only hospital outpatient and Medicare reimbursement would suggest it\u2019s relatively modest. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : First question is a geographic focused question, because you talked a fair amount here on this call about the developed markets. I wonder if you could spend just a minute or two on China as it didn\u2019t get as much attention on the call. Where in China do you think that we have a particularly good \u201918; how are things evolving there; where in China, given some of the liquidity news items out there should we maybe budget in, something that is a little bit moderate relative to \u201917. Tom Joyce : Steve, China has been an important growth driver for us for a number of years. Today we do, I think in excess of $2 billion of revenue in China. We\u2019ve strong positions across each of the platforms and there are extraordinary secular market drivers in China that support our water quality platform with the environmental concerns in China. Product ID even with the growth of the middle class and consumer package goods, diagnostics and life science both receiving significant amount of investment from the Chinese government. And as I\u2019ve mentioned a number of times, our dental business continues to grow high single digits and in certain quarters double digits pretty consistently in China. So I think if you step back, it\u2019s a boy this is a portfolio that really lines up well with a number of key growth drivers in the Chinese market. In terms of any changes, you have the impact of a relatively new five year plan in China. Again I think that\u2019s going to be supportive broadly across most of our platforms, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a change there.  So in general we feel pretty good about continuing contributions from the Chinese market in each one of the platforms. Dan Comas : One of the things that was encouraging in China was we were up double digit for the year and we were basically 10%-11% every quarter through 2017. So it feels like we have pretty good momentum. It\u2019s a bigger base now for that kick down a point or two share, but things are still feeling pretty good over there. Steve Beuchaw : Good to hear. One more of a big picture question for Tom, it\u2019s hard not to look at the improvement of organic growth to your core growth in the last couple of quarter, and here the really encouraging commentary on new product flow and execution across the businesses and think, hey vow these guys are seeing some step up in R&D, step up in commercial investment, really pay-off.  It will be helpful just to hear what you\u2019ve learned and how this success, the way I perceive it as a success downstream of an investment effort. How is that changing your thinking if at all about the medium or long term, appropriate level of spend on R&D and sales and marketing in the organization. Tom Joyce : Well clearly this has been an evolution for us. Part of that evolution Steve is the evolution of the portfolio. Many of the changes that we\u2019ve made in the portfolio over quite a number of years not just in the last two years or so, but really over the last probably better than five years has set up a portfolio that is really aligned to markets that have a great growth drivers.  I think secondly, we\u2019ve seen an evolution in the Danaher business system, as the tools of DBS have evolved beyond lean in to leadership and most importantly in to growth, and we see the tools of DBS which by the way continued to evolve. Even in 2017, we developed incremental growth tools that are having an impact on each of our businesses from a commercial execution perspective, but also in terms of driving higher rates of innovation.  And I think finally on innovation, I think it has and will continue to play an increasingly important role in our growth rates. And those investments in R&D have paid off and we can point to a number of those examples in our businesses where we see new products from incrementing their growth rates. I point specifically for example the Videojet whose got probably the most robust new product pipeline in its history today with the 1860 fully censored and wired to the internet through greater levels of customer services, Hach\u2019s launch of the [Claro] system leveraging the internet of things as well. So I think the portfolio evolution, the evolution of the tools on the Danaher business system, continued investment in R&D to drive higher rates of innovation, and then finally inorganically obviously the deals we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years have been incremental to our growth rates. You clearly look at the impact of Cepheid and Phenomenex our most recent acquisitions, but certainly Pall and Nobel having an impact. And those 10 strategic Bolton acquisitions, each of those have strategic impacts on our businesses and the ability to drive incremental growth over time through what at times is kind of early stage investment that can drive long term innovation related growth.  So it\u2019s really a combination of things, having learned a lot in the process. Certainly we have, but I think that learning has come really as a function of executing a plan. Operator : And we\u2019ll next to Richard Eastman with Baird. Richard Eastman : Could we just circle back if you will to the life sciences up margin here in the quarter, and maybe just speak a little bit to Pall, the strength that Pall and the impact of mix on that up margin. I\u2019m curious, Dan you flagged Pall\u2019s gross margin improvement as a big factor in overall margin improvement and expansion. But could you maybe just give us a sense to Pall\u2019s gross margin improvement during and for the full year in calendar \u201917. Dan Comas : As you know Rick when we purchased the business it was a high-teens [OP][ph] business and we\u2019re up a 1000 basis points since the time of the acquisition, and a big chunk of that has been [indiscernible] in the gross margin. I would say that, but one thing that was encouraging in the quarter, was the gross margin improvement in life science is pretty broad based. And none of the businesses grew mid-single digits. Beck life sciences improved their gross margin and then turned their operating margins; we\u2019re seeing the same thing as Sciex good margin expansion.  Though I noted Pall the big driver of the life science improvement. It was this broad based particularly to put up that sort of number as I\u2019ve seen it, and clearly the better core growth helps. Though all those businesses are doing a good job expanding the growth margins, leveraging G&A, they are off stepping up their R&D in sales and marketing. So we\u2019re getting those margins step up. Back to Tom\u2019s point about investing and grow while stepping up our growth investment. Richard Eastman : Again when you look at the out margin here, for the fourth quarter assuming Pall, both Pall life sciences as well as PI were stepped up and rebounded, how do you look at the gross margin in the fourth quarter here is maybe a new structural level here to grow off and leverage off with core growth going forward for life sciences? Dan Comas : Rick I\u2019d have to look at them more carefully. As you know there\u2019s some seasonal benefit in the fourth quarter in life science with equipment sales, which were very strong. But I believe we\u2019ve made a lot of structural changes in the cost profile across life science. And I have to look at it specifically kind of going to the next couple of quarters, but this step up is real. Richard Eastman : And then just last question follow-up on dental, if we look at the dental, I think Tom you had suggested maybe first half of \u201918 would see flattish revenue. So perhaps a little bit of growth in the back half. But I\u2019m curious when you look at the margin expectation around dental for \u201918, do we have enough restructuring, do we have enough growth investment without a great deal of topline to drive 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement in \u201918. What does the plan look like given the sales outlook for [dental]? Tom Joyce : I think we\u2019ve balanced that pretty well over the last couple of years and we\u2019ll continue to do that in 2018. We\u2019ve applied restructuring dollars to drive enhanced productivity in a number of different areas, but at the same time we\u2019ve invested in R&D and we\u2019ve invested in sales and marketing and I\u2019ve cited a number of those numbers as you may recall. And so I think it\u2019s a balance, and I think we shook that balance pretty well in \u201916 and \u201917 and I don\u2019t anticipate that we will approach any differently in 2018. Operator : We\u2019ll take our final question today from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Doug Schenkel : I\u2019m going to start on Pall; you guys had a solid quarter even normalized for hurricane effect. Your comments earlier on order trends is encouraging. Specific to bio production is it safe to say that you\u2019ve seen an improvement in demands or at least normalization subsequent to some of the customer inventory rebalancing dynamics you mentioned earlier in 2017. Tom Joyce : Doug it is safe to say that. It was a solid performance even normalized, the order trends are good and those order trends do point to an improvement in the demand profile, because I think you and others know, we saw a number of customers in that market adjust levels in a couple of cases slow down production during the course of 2017, and I think in the late third quarter and in to certainly the fourth quarter, we saw order trends improve. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. Doug Schenkel : And maybe just to close out by going back to something we covered at length earlier in the discussion the topic of 2018 guidance rationale. You were clear in saying that based on what you saw in January you don\u2019t think there was any pull forward of revenue from Q1 in to Q4. And we know you have a history of tending to be prudently conservative with guidance especially earlier in the year.  And that said, I just want to confirm two other things, one, that current FX rates would seemingly cut out as much as $0.10 to full year EPS relative to on the original guidance at least based on our math that those are not fully reflected in current guidance. And second, that you\u2019ve not fully adjusted guidance for the lower tax rate dynamic that you mentioned in response to an earlier question. Tom Joyce : Doug let me try to answer that. We have a \u2013 it\u2019s been in the 12, 13, 14 years we\u2019ve sort of avoided adjusted December guidance when we get to January. Just feels too early, too quick. I also recognized that January call next year will be Matt McGrew\u2019s first call. So I\u2019m not suddenly looking to sort of change things up here. But you\u2019re right there are some tailwinds out there, whether a Q4 demand, December demand, January numbers, they all point to good numbers. We are benefitting from the further weakness of the dollar and we are a little more optimistic on the tax rate. Yes, probably a few offsets there, probably a higher share count, but that offsets are modest. So net-net we are feeling pretty good about where we are, and if those good things continue, we\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to update you through the year. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks Tracey and thanks everyone for joining us. We\u2019re around all day for questions. Operator : This does conclude todays\u2019 conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re off to a great start in 2018 with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectations. We delivered our second consecutive quarter of 5.5% core revenue growth mid-teens earnings per share growth, healthy margin expansion and strong free cash flow. This performance is a testament to the power of the Danaher Business System, consistent execution by the team and our focus on long-term value creation. We drove share gains at a number of our operating companies while continuing to invest in our businesses to enhance our long-term growth trajectory. Our performance in the quarter, combined with significant opportunities across the portfolio and our solid balance sheet, positions us well for strong performance in 2018 and beyond. Turning to our first quarter results. Sales increased 11.5% to $4.7 billion with the impact of currency translation increasing revenue by 5% and acquisitions adding 1%. Core revenue was up 5.5% with 4 of our 5 platforms delivering mid-single-digit or better core growth. First quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $0.99, representing 16.5% growth year-on-year. We generated $691 million of free cash flow, resulting in over 70% growth year-on-year, and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 122%. Our outstanding cash flow generation sets us up well for additional capital deployment in 2018. Geographically, high-growth markets revenue grew approximately 10% with China and India leading the way. In developed markets, we saw a mid-single-digit revenue growth in Europe and low single-digit growth in North America. Our gross margin for the first quarter was 56.3%, an all-time high and up 80 basis points year-on-year while core operating margin expanded 140 basis points. Our margin performance was driven by a combination of higher core growth and good execution, particularly across our Life Sciences & Diagnostics platforms. Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our first quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue was up 13% and core revenue grew 5.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 18.4% with both core and reported margins increasing over 200 basis points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of more than 100 basis points of core margin improvement as the team continues their outstanding DBS execution. Beckman Life Sciences delivered double-digit core revenue growth with positive performance across all major product lines and regions. You\u2019ve heard us talk about Beckman\u2019s improved innovation cadence over the last few years, which has helped drive consistent mid-single-digit or better core growth. The combination of the team\u2019s new product development and commercial execution has also enhanced margin performance. Today, both gross and operating profit margins are more than 500 basis points higher than 3 years ago. We believe that innovation defines our future. And Beckman is a tremendous example of this Danaher core value. At Leica Microsystems, low single-digit core revenue growth was led by Western Europe and China. From a product line perspective, we saw good momentum in confocal, driven by demand for the recently launched SP8 DIVE microscope. The SP8 DIVE enables more advanced imaging of complex biological processes in live tissue samples, which is key for driving breakthrough discoveries in cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Core revenue at SCIEX increased at a high single-digit rate with particular strength in Western Europe and China. SCIEX maintained strong instrument win rates inclusive of the x500R series, which is primarily used for food, environmental and forensic applications. Our separation consumables businesses, Phenomenex and Agela, also performed well, achieving nearly double-digit core revenue growth during the quarter. Turning to Pall. The team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by strength in both our Life Sciences and industrial businesses. In particular, biopharma had another good quarter, led by double-digit growth in the single-use product category. We\u2019re seeing steady order trends across our biopharma business and we expect performance to accelerate as we move through the year. Pall\u2019s process and industrial business achieved its second consecutive quarter of growth, driven by a strong order book. Microelectronics performed well yet again as the team\u2019s terrific commercial execution and recent product launches contributed to ongoing share gains and another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. Just last week, we closed our acquisition of Integrated DNA Technologies, or IDT, for a purchase price of approximately $2 billion. IDT manufactures high-quality custom DNA and RNA oligos used in a variety of genomics applications, including biopharmaceutical research and development and clinical diagnostics. IDT\u2019s products and solutions help scientists better streamline their workflows and advance their research as they work to cure some of the world\u2019s most challenging diseases. As a leading player in the fast-growing genomics reagent segment, IDT has generated double-digit core revenue growth and has an attractive margin profile. The business will be a stand-alone operating company in our Life Science segment. And we\u2019re excited for the IDT team to join Danaher. Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 14.5% and core revenue increased 9.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 16.3% with both core and reported margins up 470 basis points. This improvement is largely attributable to higher sales volumes and cost savings derived from productivity initiatives implemented last year. At Beckman Coulter, low single-digit core revenue growth was led by the high-growth markets, particularly China. Across our product lines, we saw growth in immunoassay, urinalysis and clinical chemistry. The Beckman team strengthened their product offering with the recent addition of the Access Sensitive Estradiol assay, which rounds out our comprehensive reproductive health test menu. This new estradiol assay provides a unique combination of high sensitivity and broad measuring range, which reduces the need for costly repeat testing. This launch follows the recent FDA clearance of Beckman\u2019s Automated AMH assay in the U.S. And these new additions establish our reproductive health portfolio as one of the most comprehensive menus in the industry. Radiometer grew at a mid-single-digit rate with strength in China, driving double-digit gains in high-growth markets. Both our blood gas and AQT product lines continued to perform well. Leica Biosystems delivered high single-digit core revenue growth during the quarter. The momentum was broad-based both in terms of geography and across all major product lines. Recently launched new instruments in advanced staining and core histology have gained traction and have been key contributors to Leica\u2019s performance. In the spirit of continuous improvement, the Leica Biosystems team has focused recent DBS initiatives on new product development and launch excellence. We\u2019ve reduced our time to market for new products by almost 50% and introduced 3 times as many new products in the last 12 months as we did in the prior year. The effective use of DBS growth tools enables Leica Biosystems to accelerate the development of differentiated workflow solutions, helping improve quality and turnaround time for our anatomical pathology customers. At Cepheid, the team delivered another tremendous quarter with more than 40% core revenue growth as all major regions and product lines performed very well. Cepheid\u2019s fantastic results during the first quarter were driven by a combination of good commercial execution, test menu expansion and what has been a particularly challenging flu season. One example of Cepheid\u2019s test menu expansion is the recent FDA clearance of the CLIA-waived Xpert Xpress Flu test. With this CLIA waiver, Cepheid can provide easy-to-use molecular testing in different care settings that are more easily accessible to patients, like a physician office lab or a local clinic. By bringing critical testing closer to the patient, Cepheid provides a more convenient and comfortable patient experience without compromising testing accuracy. We could not be happier with the progress that the Cepheid team is making. And they continue to exceed our initial expectations 18 months post acquisition. Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenue increased 2.5% and core revenue was down 3%. Dental\u2019s operating profit margin declined to 7.6% largely due to lower sales volume, continued investment spend and productivity initiatives across the platform. By product line, positive performance in our specialty consumables businesses, including mid-single-digit core revenue growth at Nobel, was more than offset by anticipated declines in equipment and traditional consumables. As we\u2019ve mentioned over the past few quarters, we continue to see a negative impact from the realignment of certain distributor and manufacturer relationships, resulting in inventory adjustments in the distribution channel. Additionally, given the strength across our other businesses, we took proactive measures in the first quarter to address some of these challenges. We believe the negative impact of these dynamics will moderate as we move through 2018. In the meantime, we\u2019re investing in new product development across our Dental portfolio. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental trade show in February, we featured several innovative products around our digital offering, including the KaVo X Pro intraoral scanner, which provides market-leading speed and accuracy with a comfortable, easy-to-use design. By expanding our digital product line, we\u2019re able to provide our Dental customers with the integrated solutions they need across their entire workflow, from patient diagnosis to treatment. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 12.5% with core revenue up 4.5%. Core operating margin increased by 15 basis points and reported operating margin declined 60 basis points to 22.1%. In Product Identification, core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. We saw a high single-digit core growth in our marking and coding businesses with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Low single-digit core growth in our packaging and color solutions was driven largely by North America and Western Europe. 2017 was an exceptional year for Videojet in terms of new product development, and we\u2019re certainly seeing the positive results from those product launches beginning to materialize. New technologies, like the continuous inkjet 1860 printer, which offers broad onboard predictive analytics and remote service connectivity, have gained great early traction and are contributing to Videojet\u2019s consistent growth. Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue was up mid-single digits with the strength of performance broad-based across our water treatment and analytical instrumentation businesses. Hach grew at a mid-single-digit rate with our core municipal and industrial end markets continuing to perform well, particularly in North America, Latin America and China. Hach achieved more than 20% core revenue growth in China during the quarter with the team\u2019s enhanced commercial execution helping to position the business well for the Chinese EPA\u2019s active project pipeline. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing, we\u2019ve increased our win rate for municipal projects focused on protecting and monitoring water resources across the country. At ChemTreat, low single-digit core revenue growth was driven by solid performance in Latin America and certain other high-growth markets. By end market, growth in mining and power was partially offset by softer results in chemical and oil and gas. Lastly, Trojan\u2019s core growth was up high single digits as the team sustained a strong customer win rate and market share gains. Bookings and revenue growth benefited from momentum in the North American and Chinese municipal markets. Trojan\u2019s performance is supported by a combination of outstanding execution and recent new product introductions, which expand Trojan\u2019s capabilities and further enhance their competitive advantage. So to wrap up, we are extremely pleased with our first quarter results and continue to generate momentum as we strive to build a better and stronger Danaher. Our performance was a testament to the team\u2019s execution and unending drive towards continuous improvement, helping us deliver 5.5% core revenue growth, mid-teens EPS growth, 140 basis points of core margin improvement and an over 70% increase in free cash flow. We\u2019re also pleased to welcome IDT into our Life Science platform, giving us greater exposure to the highly attractive, fast-growing genomics consumables segment. Even with this acquisition, our balance sheet remains strong and positions us well for additional capital deployment as we move through 2018. So as we look ahead, we believe the strength of our portfolio, combined with the power of the Danaher Business System provide us with the foundation to achieve long-term shareholder value creation. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.07 and $1.10 which assumes core revenue growth of approximately 4%. We are raising our full year adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to a range of $4.38 to $4.45 versus our previous range of $4.25 to $4.35. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Debbie, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question today from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey Good morning, good quarter. Just to kick it off, I hate to start with Dental, but that was certainly softer than we\u2019ve been expecting against the flat comps. So can you, Tom, maybe just talk a little bit about where are we in the distributor destocking cycle? And then should we still be expecting a recovery to kind of low single-digit growth in the back half of the year? Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks, Tycho. Tycho, I think as you know and certainly others know, our North American Dental business largely goes through distribution partners. And we have outstanding relationships with these partners, where they provide a whole array of services and training and support associated with their value proposition. And we partner with these distributors to deal with challenges as time goes on. And when you have a combination of a modest end market environment as we\u2019ve had and recent shifts in these exclusive distribution and manufacturer relationships, these tend to create these inventory challenges. Now these are two different unique factors. But we team with the distribution channel and work with them to adjust inventory levels where and when we can. And in turn, they work with us to drive growth programs to stimulate end user demand. And so really what you saw here in the quarter was a proactive effort on our part to work with the channel to make these adjustments, and in turn, also work with them in supporting them on these growth programs. So all that being said, you end up with a \u2013 obviously a print that is a tough print, particularly here in North America. But that being said, we think there are a lot of things that are frankly pointing in the right direction relative to improvement in the Dental performance going forward. Our high-growth market, this business remains very solid with China continuing to grow double digits in the first quarter. The specialty consumables business remains good, Nobel up mid-single digits. It was one of our better quarters in Europe in some time, where there\u2019s less channel noise. Kerr was up mid-single digits there. And sellout has begun to stabilize, in fact, has stabilized for KaVo Kerr, including the second straight positive quarter for Kerr in North America on the sellout side. So I think there\u2019s a number of things that we would point to that would suggest tough print here in certainly associated with that KaVo Kerr business in North America in the quarter. But a lot of reasons to believe that we\u2019ve sort of flattened out on a bottom here and we\u2019re going to see some improvement in performance going forward. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of a context both in terms of what happened in the quarter, but also why we\u2019re positive on things beginning to improve. Tycho Peterson : That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up on Diagnostics, two questions here. One on Cepheid, are you able to kind of comment on how much was flu versus normalized growth in the quarter? And then as we think about Beckman, you\u2019re still on kind of low single-digit core growth here. You highlighted some of the new assays. Obviously, there\u2019s some new competitive platforms that have been brought to market. Can you maybe just talk about how you feel about the competitive positioning of the Beckman instrument side? And are you investing enough there at the moment? Tom Joyce : Sure. So on Cepheid, obviously a huge quarter for Cepheid at 40% growth. The flu impact was an important driver there. If you netted for flu, you\u2019re probably still talking about mid-teens growth at Cepheid during the quarter. I think what\u2019s also important to recognize though, Tycho, about our performance at Cepheid in the quarter is, starting with flu, again that was not only a function of the seasonality, but we believe based on new customer penetration, adoption of molecular, particularly in different care settings that we took share associated with flu. And so that bodes well for continued growth over the years. Secondly, we saw growth geographically as well as across a number of different product lines. I would point certainly to sexual health as being one of those particular areas. We saw growth not only in core labs and central labs at hospitals, but we saw that in some of the more decentralized care settings as well. So I think a number of factors there that contribute to a continuing very positive outlook. Around Cepheid\u2019s performance in terms of commercial execution and new test execution. The new test that I talked about in terms of the CLIA-waived test associated with the Xpert Xpress Flu, also again a contributor, but a number of other assays coming through the pipeline that I think bode well for continued good performance at Cepheid. Turning to Beckman, I think there\u2019s a number of good things going on there. I mentioned in my comments earlier about growth in clinical chemistry, immunoassay and urinalysis, another good quarter of high single-digit or better growth in high-growth markets. China, India, Latin America all showing good performance, specifically around IA and urinalysis, high single-digit or better the last three years. So in those market segments where you get better underlying growth rates from a market standpoint, we are performing well. Positive growth in clinical chemistry, which I think builds on the 2017 momentum, which was the first year of growth since, I think, 2014. And competitively, I think I would probably point most specifically to hematology, which is where we\u2019ve been most challenged, again a smaller \u2013 the smallest portion of the business against \u2013 at least relative to IA and clinical chemistry. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve had some real competitive challenges. I think there\u2019s a lot of good news going on there. We\u2019ve launched the DxH 500 as well as the DxH 520. Those are two new hematology instruments. And particularly important is the new form factor associated with those, not only good performance but smaller footprint, which makes a big difference to our end users. And then finally, we\u2019ve got a new DxH 900 coming out with some unique capabilities associated with sepsis diagnoses. And I think a combination of those things over the next, I would say, year or two as those become seeded in the market will improve our competitive position. And that area has been the most significant area of competitive challenge for us in the last \u2013 well, really probably since we acquired the business. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Tom Joyce : Thanks Tycho. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Hi, good morning guys and congrats. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken : So on the high-growth market side, it seems pretty broad-based. It sounds like a lot of the businesses had pretty good results in China. It also feels like Cepheid\u2019s opportunity, particularly into HGM, is maybe one of the largest you\u2019ve had for a deal for some time. So help us tease out kind of the underlying versus kind of what you\u2019re getting maybe incrementally from some of these recent acquisitions that were more domestic or Europe-based, where you\u2019re seeing pretty good sell-through into markets that you obviously have a much better channel into. Tom Joyce : Yes. Ross, it was a good quarter broadly across the geographies. I mentioned some of this. But just a quick recap that the U.S. was a low single-digit market but pretty good and pretty consistent performance across our businesses. Europe was a bright spot with mid-single-digit growth in Europe and good performance across a number of businesses. And then to your question around the high-growth markets, China was double digits for the fifth quarter in a row and pretty broad-based with all five platforms double digits or better in terms of \u2013 into the teens and beyond. India was also a double-digit market and it has been very good for us. We\u2019ve seen improvement in some markets that had some challenges over the last couple of years, Russia has shown improvement. Eastern Europe is better. Latin America, not bad, we\u2019ve seen some improvement in Brazil with some weakness in Mexico. That really leaves out the Middle East, which is still a pretty soft market. I didn\u2019t touch on Japan, which is roughly low single digits but no big changes. As it relates to newly acquired businesses, Cepheid, big opportunity in China. We\u2019ve 3x-ed the sales force, admittedly starting from a small base. So those multiples will continue going forward throughout this year. That will be a big growth in our sales force there. We\u2019re limited in terms of test registrations right now in China for Cepheid. So driving incremental tests through registration will allow us to fully take advantage of those incremental sales forces as they come online. So I think there\u2019s been good opportunity there. We\u2019ve seen good performance at Pall, going back an acquisition now, in terms of geographic expansion and Phenomenex as well. If you go all the way back to the Nobel acquisition, they had some real weaknesses in a number of markets, not just in the high-growth markets. And by expanding the sales force in a number of places and using the tools of DBS from a growth perspective, that\u2019s been a big help in terms of getting Nobel\u2019s growth going from about flat when we acquired it to now mid-single digits. So I think you can think about a number of our acquisitions as being underpenetrated in a number of markets. And that has been a source of growth for several of them. I\u2019ll conclude \u2013 sorry for the long-winded answer here. But IDT just very briefly, new acquisition. IDT is a very U.S.-centric business, a great business. But probably 3/4, 75% of the balance of sale is U.S.-based or North American-based. So again, another opportunity to leverage our footprint and the large footprint that we have in our Life Science platform to try and expand the reach of a great commercial front end that we have at IDT. Ross Muken : Tom, you stole the follow-up question I was going to ask you on IDT into non-U. S. But maybe just quickly, can you just give us a feel on that one on IDT? That\u2019s a very unique business, custom oligos, fantastic market share. It\u2019s probably the best in the world at what it does by far. How does that sort of fit into kind of your portfolio? It\u2019s kind of a unique business. And sort of what else are you going to be doing, I guess, around molecular biology, sequencing, PCR, synthetic biology, all the areas they kind of play into that maybe aren\u2019t areas we\u2019ve traditionally thought of you being a leader in? Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks, Ross. It fits in, in such a number of different ways, starting with how attractive the market is in which IDT plays and the leadership position that it commands in that very attractive market. Just for context, the genomics reagent market is about a $3 billion market growing double digits with some great secular growth drivers around. And you mentioned a couple of these, next-gen sequencing, gene editing, qPCR, not to mention sort of basic oligos. And of course, over time, we\u2019ll see the growth in synthetic biology. And so into this great market, you have this leading player, IDT, generally a founder-built \u2013 a founder-led business over a number of years, building a leadership position around quality, turnaround time, all of which then leads to tremendous brand identity. Their Net Promoter Scores, Ross, were as probably as high as any Net Promoter Scores I\u2019ve seen in a newly acquired business in a long, long time. And all that sort of then combines to deliver this terrific mid-teens kind of growth rate over the last several years and really strong gross margins at north of 60%. And so when you step back from this, IDT really brings to our Life Science platform a position in high-value consumables with a tremendous commercial front end that has delivered consistent performance over a long period of time. We think there\u2019s opportunities for us to add incremental value here. We talked certainly about expanding geographically being one. But there\u2019s also opportunities for DBS to play a role here, both in terms of operational improvements, and in addition to that, on the growth side. So we think it fits extraordinarily well with a number of the growth areas in Life Sciences and really fills what otherwise you would have said would have been a bit of a void in terms of addressing the high-growth consumables positions in those high-growth segments. Ross Muken : Great. And maybe just one quick clarification, I wasn\u2019t sure if I missed it. Did you update the full year organic guide? Tom Joyce : Well, we certainly aren\u2019t talking about the 3.5% that we had in the prior guide, Ross. We did say that we expected roughly 4% core growth here in the second quarter. We\u2019re not even four months into the year here. And so I think as we get a little bit deeper here into the second quarter, we\u2019ll get a look at what we think is going to happen in the back half of the year. But we feel very good about the momentum we\u2019re building and feel very good about where we are going here into the second quarter. Ross Muken : Thanks, Tom. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi good morning. Some good information. So I\u2019m going to go a little bit over to the industrial side. And would you characterize Pall Industrial as kind of accelerating, stable or some other description? It wasn\u2019t totally clear in the remarks. Tom Joyce : I think there\u2019s a number of areas of improvements there, Scott. I think one of the areas that I highlighted was microelectronics. That\u2019s been a bright spot within Pall\u2019s more industrial and process-oriented business for quite a while now. And we see that sustaining itself behind really good execution and some new products as well. But I think beyond that, what we\u2019ve really seen is some improvements in commercial execution and some improvements in new product development that are combining to intersect with what I think are some improving market dynamics. You may recall, our timing wasn\u2019t exactly brilliant in terms of the industrial slowdown that took place not long after the Pall acquisition closed. And so that segment of the business struggled a bit, not only from its historically poor execution, but that market dynamic, I think we have seen improvement in both that bodes well for contributing \u2013 a continuing contribution to Pall\u2019s improving growth rate. Scott Davis : I mean, if you go back and you look at your original Pall assumptions and your deal model, I mean, are we catching up to the deal model despite the cyclical downdraft? Or are we\u2026 Dan Comas : Yes, I think we\u2019re tracking well to the deal model. We\u2019re a little behind on revenue because of the industrial side. We\u2019re back to kind of close to the low to mid-single-digit growth at the industrial side. But we\u2019re well ahead on the cost side. So overall, we\u2019re very pleased on how we\u2019re tracking versus our expectations. Particularly now that we\u2019ve had a couple of quarters of mid-single-digit growth on the industrial side, the growth equation\u2019s playing out well. And clearly, we\u2019re far ahead on the margin side. Scott Davis : Right. And everything looked great, except Dental, obviously again. And every company has something that\u2019s not going right, right? But this has been a business that\u2019s not been going right for a while. Is there an end of your patience? Is there kind of a tipping point, I would say, where you\u2019d say, \" Hey, maybe this is just in the hands \u2013 better in the hands of someone else\"? Tom Joyce : Yes. Scott, my patience or tolerance for a business that is in a challenged position is largely a function of whether or not we have the right kind of vision for areas for improvement and whether we\u2019re making progress moving down that path towards that vision. And I think in a number of areas, we\u2019ve shown really good progress in terms of both the cost side, where we\u2019ve rationalized a platform that had not been rationalized for a long, long time, consolidating operating companies from 10 to 4, consolidating sites, manufacturing sites and back offices by over 1/3 and then investing for new product innovation and starting to get some growth associated with those. So I think we\u2019re making good progress. And that allows us to have a bit of patience for that. Now that being said, it is always a topic in our boardroom as to the overall portfolio of Danaher. And you know our track record, Scott, as well as anybody that we are continually evaluating businesses, individual operating companies and even platforms in terms of their long-term potential and whether they\u2019re in the right hands, to use your term. And that is not just a topic that we discuss from time to time. It\u2019s always on the table. And so we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that, continue to evaluate our progress and continue to evaluate the overall dental market and how to position our Dental business for the highest return to shareholders. Scott Davis : Great. Well good luck guys and we\u2019re in for year some keep it up. Tom Joyce : Thanks Scott. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Good morning. My first question is on EPS guidance. You increased full year guidance for EPS at the midpoint by about $0.12. Q1 contributed about $0.08 to this. You should add a few cents of accretion for the IDT acquisition. So it doesn\u2019t look like full year EPS guidance for the base business was meaningfully increased for the balance of 2018. It certainly sounds like most businesses are at least holding serve with solid momentum. So is updated EPS guidance a function of conservatism? Is there some incremental investment that\u2019s now planned? Or is there some other dynamic at play that we should be contemplating? Dan Comas : Doug, I guess the way that I would look at it is we raised the midpoint by $0.12. We beat the first quarter versus consensus by about $0.05 or $0.06. So there\u2019s maybe $0.06 or $0.07 coming from a combination of general confidence with the order book and margins, currency, inclusion \u2013 obviously, inclusion of IDT. But we also recognize that if this positive environment continues, that will allow us some additional degrees of freedom here to potentially, as you point out, to accelerate some of our growth investments. Doug Schenkel : Thank you for that. And then I just wanted to dig in a bit more on Diagnostics, specifically Beckman Coulter in North America. It looks like Beckman Diagnostics' revenue had modest declines in North America and developed markets. Could you provide a bit more detail on what the key drivers there were and if these declines are expected to continue for the balance of 2018? And relatedly, are you seeing pricing renewal or win rates being impacted by PAMA? And I guess, as long as I\u2019m going along these lines, did flu negatively impact Beckman volumes in any ancillary businesses? Thank you. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Doug. First, in terms of North America, North America has historically been, going all the way back to when we acquired Beckman, the most challenging market for us. That business was in decline in North America when we acquired the business. We track the \u2013 our retention of customers and our win rates very closely in each one of the markets. And we\u2019ve been very encouraged by the progress that we\u2019ve made in North America associated with retention and with new customer win rates. Our strength has typically come from our core businesses around immunoassay and clinical chemistry with the addition of Iris in urinalysis, an acquisition we did following Beckman, as well as the microbiology business, we\u2019ve strengthened our offering in North America now. As I mentioned relative to, I think, Tycho\u2019s question earlier, the challenge has really been around hematology. And that\u2019s where our retention and our win rates have been the most challenged. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve put a great deal of energy and investment associated with new product development to better position ourselves for improved competitiveness in North America. So that\u2019s the way I\u2019d probably characterize it. I think you\u2019re on the right track in terms of that particular geography being one of our biggest opportunities for improvement. And I think we\u2019re making progress there. Relative to PAMA, Doug, we\u2019ve seen very little impact of PAMA to this point. Certainly, we\u2019ve had some dialogue about PAMA with a number of key customers. I think they understand well the impact that PAMA has, at least associated with a fairly narrow segment of our business. Remember, I guess, for others on the call, PAMA impacts only U.S. businesses, U.S. Diagnostic businesses. Only 40% of our Diagnostic business at Beckman is in the U.S. And of that business in the U.S., 75% of it is in the hospital. And PAMA, the cuts in reimbursement associated with PAMA, are associated with generally outpatient testing. And so the impact has been fairly modest at this point. We expect those \u2013 the dialogue around PAMA to continue this year associated with the contract renewals. But we think we understand what that modest impact might look like and are managing to that accordingly. And then in terms of the flu impact across the overall market, we didn\u2019t see the higher level of spend associated with flu, Doug, as having any negative impact on the rest of our sell in to our end users. So in general, we saw that flu as largely incremental, driven by obviously the challenging nature of the season itself but also associated with our good execution associated with new customer penetration and new test menu. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thank you, very much. So I guess my first question would really be on the Environmental & Applied Solutions business, which I don\u2019t think has been really touched on so far. Really it\u2019s around the core margins. That performance year-on-year at least has been fairly sluggish in the past two quarters. I think you talked about higher investment spend back in January. But I also noticed that pricing was a big tailwind in Q1. But you only saw a, I think, a 15 bps core margin expansion. So I wondered if you could give an update on the investments in that segment, but also whether there\u2019s some price-cost dynamic that\u2019s crimping margins as well. Tom Joyce : Julian, thanks for that question. And by the way, I know the follow-up questions are not the problem. It\u2019s my long answers that are probably the problem, so sorry for that. We have really strong margins across EAS, generally. It\u2019s a 22% margin platform in the most recent period. And the margins were down a bit in the quarter. There was acquisition impact that probably had about 75 basis points associated with some recent deals over at water, like AppliTek and Kipp & Zonen, that come in at lower margins. The core operating margins were up, up modestly and probably in the area of 15 to \u2013 15 basis points or so. And so we did, during the course, given the strength of other businesses in the quarter, accelerate some restructuring in the platform in a couple of areas. And we did make some incremental investments in Q1, including R&D as a percent of sales that stepped up about 50 points. So if you set aside those items, the core operating margin would have been up closer to 50 basis points. There was actually a pricing contribution there as well. We \u2013 given that we\u2019re in a bit more of an inflationary environment today, we do have a number of our businesses being what I think is very thoughtful about \u2013 about using price, again where it\u2019s well justified and where we\u2019ve got strength to deal with it at the end user level. A couple of examples of that would be clearly at Videojet, where we\u2019re seeing price readthrough, and at ChemTreat as well. Obviously, ChemTreat being a little bit more oriented to chemical pricing associated with their consumables, I think we\u2019re on a firm foundation of going out and getting price there as it\u2019s well justified. So those are a few of the moving parts associated with what obviously, at a print level, were some down margins. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful thanks. And my follow-up would just be when we\u2019re looking at the second quarter guidance on core growth, what sort of leveling out or abatement of the core sales decline does that assume happens within Dental and whether that\u2019s more pronounced on the equipment side or traditional consumables in terms of that improvement of the year-on-year trend from Q1? Tom Joyce : We\u2019re looking at Dental as being roughly flattish in the second quarter. And that would reflect continued good performance of our specialty consumables businesses, like Nobel, that I mentioned, grew mid-single digits in the quarter, and the consumable and equipment side of KaVo Kerr being down marginally. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Julian Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Steve Steve Beuchaw : Hi, thanks for the time. And good morning here. I just wanted to try to unpack a couple of things that have come up on the call. The first was, in your prepared remarks, Tom, you made mention of an expectation within the context of Pall and bioprocess and single-use for an acceleration over the balance of the year. It\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019ve been calling for, I think, dating back to December in the Analyst Day. But I wonder if you can give us just a little bit more insight into how you\u2019ve seen that evolve here through the first several months of the year. Tom Joyce : Steve, we\u2019ve seen order rates continue to improve across bioprocessing. You probably remember well, we saw those order rates soften in 2017, certainly through the middle to latter part of the year. They have continued to improve both across the more general filtration, let\u2019s call it filtration side of bioprocessing but also specifically around single-use. Single-use has been pretty strong and pretty consistently strong. But we\u2019ve seen that continue to grow as we see incremental customers adopting the single-use technologies as they get into smaller batch sizes associated with large-molecule drugs. So overall, we feel pretty positive about the continued performance at Pall on that side of the business. Steve Beuchaw : And then just to circle back to Dental to make sure that we understand the trends to the extent that we can, excluding the impact of some of these near-term transition points. Can you give us a sense for maybe with a little bit more specificity where the sellout was in the quarter? I want to say it was in the 3, 3.5 neighborhood for 4Q. Are we still in that ballpark? And then as it relates to the impact of inventory, are we thinking about inventory this year as being a bigger headwind than we were before? Or is it just more accelerated into the front part of the year as you guys have worked with your distribution partners there? Thanks so much. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Steve. First, on that last point, no, I would not say inventory is a bigger challenge there. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably modestly lesser of a challenge. Yes, we did accelerate some of what we otherwise would have been working with the channel to reduce over the full year and move that into the first quarter, given the strength that we had in a number of our other businesses. So I think we feel pretty good about that. These inventory management challenges with the distribution channel are \u2013 they\u2019re just \u2013 they\u2019re part of doing business in a market where essentially distributors play a key value-added role across a large segment of the overall market. And so we understand that it\u2019s a partnership, and we work on these things together. As we work to help them manage inventories effectively, they work with us to help drive sellout. And the more effectively we drive sellout, obviously that takes care of some of that inventory challenge that wouldn\u2019t otherwise come out of our top line. So hopefully, we see the benefits of all that come together as the rest of the year progresses, and we expect that we will. Relative to sellout, I mentioned that we saw some improvement in consumables sellout. And I think to get any deeper than that into an individual product category, you could probably come back to Matt later on in the day, and we could probably take you through some of the individual categories on the consumables side in terms of whether it was in endo or restoratives, et cetera. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks so much, Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Steve. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in. So I\u2019m surprised no one has asked the China trade and tariff question yet, so I will do that one at this point. Obviously, I mean, I assume some of your conservatism in the organic revenue growth, sort of maintaining it where it is at the 3.5%, 4% level now is sort of driven by some concerns over the geopolitical outlook and tariffs and trade and fiscal policy. Could you sort of walk through sort of what your current thoughts on that, sort of your analysis on what could be impacted in the sort that we go to a hotter trade war? Tom Joyce : Sure. Well, I\u2019m sure I speak for a lot of businesses, far beyond our businesses today, to say that the narrative around tariffs and trade, and even \u2013 I\u2019d even go so far as even to go to the interest rates today, altogether make for a bucket of uncertainty associated with the balance of this year. And so I think we can only hope that, that narrative kind of settles to a point where the execution side is not disruptive. Specific to tariffs, where I think you started the question, we \u2013 based on what we know right now, which is pretty limited, right, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty still about what actually gets implemented and the timing of what gets implemented. But that being said, if you just took the narrative that\u2019s been put out to this point, our exposure would be very modest. We have a tremendous business in China. We do about $2 billion of revenue in China. But we have a fairly modest exposure to any of the product categories, let alone specific codes, that would be reflected in any of these onerous tariffs that might be inbound into China. On the opposite side, in terms of what we export from China and into the U.S., that\u2019s an even more modest number. Of course, our business being so highly skewed towards consumables, high gross margins, low materials content, particularly low content in some of the more basic materials, like steel and aluminum, altogether would suggest a fairly modest impact. But we will continue to monitor it closely. We know these things can change literally in a day. And we\u2019ll stay very close to it. Dan Comas : And Derik, I mean, obviously if it sort of got ugly, which it could, I think as Tom alluded to, given sort of high gross margin consumables that don\u2019t have a lot of material content typically, we have a lot less exposure than other companies. And because of the nature of those products, I think we could be more nimble in moving production around if we had to, to sort of deal with some of that. You also made, I think, in the introductory comment made some comments that we\u2019re holding to 3.5% to 4%. I think to be clear, if we were giving guidance for the full year, we would not be talking about 3.5%. I just want to make sure to provide that clarification. Derik De Bruin : Okay. Great that\u2019s helpful appreciated. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Derik. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Erin. Erin Wright : Thanks, good morning. In Dental, what do you think the long-term growth rate is, I guess, for the U.S. geographic segment in Dental? And do you think that this could be a GDP-plus kind of grower longer term? I guess, how are you characterizing kind of the current underlying demand trends? And when do you think that could potentially turn, or visibility thereon? Thanks. Tom Joyce : Erin, I think the long-term growth rate to think about specific to the U.S. is probably a 2% to 3% growth rate if you\u2019re talking about the core traditional consumables and equipment business. So that doesn\u2019t make it a GDP-plus, it makes it more like a GDP kind of business. That being said, the specialty consumables side, for example, like our implant business at Nobel and its value businesses that are associated with it, like Implant Direct and ABT, those combine to participate in much more of a mid-single-digit market and in certain geographies, a high single-digit market. Again, if you go back to traditional consumables and equipment that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s that low single-digit kind of growth rate in the U.S., those same product lines are growing double digits in China. And so I think when you look at the overall Dental platform, while the U.S. business \u2013 the U.S. market in those more traditional categories may be an uninspiring one, I think the broader categories in some of the broader geographies really make for a much more attractive global market. Erin Wright : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then following IDT, can you speak to kind of the capital deployment focus near term and longer term here, capacity for potential acquisitions as well? Thanks. Dan Comas : Sure, Erin. I mean, clearly given how we got out of the gate from a free cash flow perspective it really puts us in a good position. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think by the time we get to June, we\u2019ll have funded 80% of the IDT purchase price. So I think despite the IDT acquisition, we\u2019re back to what we\u2019re saying 4, 5 months ago, which is we\u2019re quite comfortable spending our free cash flow plus going forward here. And we\u2019re excited about some of the things out there. And we continue to be very active. So this is not like a Pall or a Cepheid-type situation, where there was a pause because of the size of the deals. Obviously, IDT is a little stronger; two, our free cash flow is better. We\u2019re right back at it, looking at sizable opportunities. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Erin. Erin Wright : Okay, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Matt Gugino for closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Debbie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We\u2019re around all day for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Before we discuss our second quarter performance, I would first like to provide more details about this morning's announcement that we intend to spin-off our dental business into an independent publicly traded company. We expect this transaction to be tax-free to Danaher shareholders and to close in the second half of 2019. We'll refer to this new entity as DentalCo for the time being and it will be comprised of Danaher's current dental segment, operating companies, which consists of Nobel Biocare, Ormco and Kavo Kerr. These businesses together generated 2017 revenue of nearly $3 billion, had gross margins of approximately 55% and EBITDA margins in the high-teens. DentalCo will be a premier global partner for the dental community with industry leading brands providing world-class innovation, service and solutions for customers. We believe this business is well positioned in attractive markets with compelling secular trends that include improving standards of dental care in emerging markets, digitalization of the dental practice and the increasing importance of dental aesthetics and implant solutions. DentalCo will have a global team of approximately 12,000 associates and will be headquartered in Southern California. The company's strong leadership team will include a number of experienced Danaher executives. Amir Aghdaei, who as group executive has had responsibility for our dental segment for the last 3 years, will become president and CEO of DentalCo. Two other Danaher leaders will also serve alongside Amir on DentalCo's Board of Directors, while retaining their roles at Danaher. Dan Daniel, Danaher's Executive Vice President, currently overseeing the diagnostics and dental segments; and Daniel Raskas, Danaher's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. In addition, our Chief Financial Officer, Dan Comas, will serve as a Special Advisor to DentalCo Post-Spin. Over the past couple years we\u2019ve highlighted the progress that Amir and the team have made on a number of key metrics. They\u2019ve done an outstanding job of helping to better position our Dental segment for long-term success and what is recently been a challenging and changing market environment. This is certainly evident in Dental' second quarter results which will run through shortly. Through a combination of recent growth investments and productivity initiatives along with the team's strong commitment to continuous improvement and the Danaher business system, the Dental segment is in a much better position today than it was just a few years ago. Since 2015, Dental's gross margins have increased by more than 100 basis points, while general and administrative costs are down nearly 50 basis points. We consolidated a number of operating companies from 10 to 3 and reduced the business's manufacturing and back office footprint, but 30%. Dental\u2019s R&D spend as a percent of sales is up more than a 100 basis points as we continue to invest in new product development across the portfolio. And at Nobel Biocare, are nearly $1 billion implant business, we\u2019ve increased R&D spend by approximately 20% launched more than 25 new products and increased the sales force by 15%. These actions have put our Dental business in a better position to accelerate its growth trajectory and drive continued margin expansion. So today\u2019s announcement is an important step towards realizing even greater potential for both Danaher and our Dental platform. We believe that our Dental business can be more impactful as a standalone entity with greater focus around organic and inorganic investment opportunities, including M&A, and that this combination to support an attractive earnings growth profile for the business going forward. This opportunity reminds us of the Fortive spin off, we completed a couple of years ago, which is generated a tremendous amount of value not only for the businesses but for shareholders as well. Most importantly and much like Fortive, we expect the Danaher Business System to continue to have meaningful positive impact on DentalCo. Across Danaher, we\u2019re continuously committed to maximizing the long-term value for all our shareholders, customers and associates. And the establishment of our Dental business as an independent company creates a tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on that commitment. We look forward to helping Amir and the entire Dental team for success as they become an independent public traded Company. As per Danaher, over more than a decade, we\u2019ve built our Product Identification, Water Quality, Diagnostics and Life Sciences platforms both organically and inorganically. These platforms share a number of common characteristics that comprise about standing brands of industry leading positions. Each of high percentage of consumables revenue that is considered captive to pursue mostly direct go-to-market strategies and they share attractive growth profiles. Our strategy will continue to focus on building around these platforms to strengthen our portfolio and competitive position as a multi industry science and technology company. Now let\u2019s turn to our second quarter results. We had an outstanding quarter with the team delivering results ahead of expectations. We achieved 6% core revenue growth, healthy margin expansion, mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow. Our performance was broad-based and we were particularly pleased this quarter with the number of our businesses that delivered 5% or better core growth. This marks our third consecutive quarter of 5.5 or better core revenue growth. And we believe we're taking market share across many of our businesses. These share gains are part of the payback we're seeing from recent growth investments and the team's strong execution utilizing the Danaher business system. We're using DBS growth tools to develop and deliver better products for our customers, and in turn, enhance our competitive position in the markets we serve. You'll hear a few examples today of how we're doing this and taking share across our portfolio. Turning to our second quarter results. Sales increased 10.5% to $5 billion with the impact of currency translation increasing revenue by 2.5% and acquisitions adding 2%. Core revenue was up 6% with 4 of the 5 platforms delivering mid-single digit for better core growth. Second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.15, representing 16% growth year-on-year. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow year-to-date resulting in more than 20% growth year-on-year and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 120 -- excuse me, 127%. Our outstanding cash flow generation sets us up well for additional capital deployment in 2018. Geographically high-growth markets revenue was up high-single digits with China leading the way. In developed markets, we saw mid-single digit growth in both North America and Western Europe as both regions have gained momentum since the beginning of the year. Our gross margin for the second quarter was 56.6%, an all-time high and up 160 basis points year-on-year, while core operating margin expanded 105 basis points. Our terrific margin performance was driven by a combination of higher core growth and good execution particularly across our Life sciences and Diagnostics platforms. Now let's take a more detailed look at our second quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 16% and core revenue was up 7.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 18.2% with core margin improvement of nearly 300 basis points. This is the 8th consecutive quarter of more than 100 basis points of core margin improvement, driven by the team's outstanding DBS execution. Segment Life Sciences delivered high-single digit core revenue growth with broad-base strength across prior clients and regions led by developed markets and China. Segment continued to benefit from strong new product introductions like CytoFLEX LX and flow cytometry and the Biomek i-Series in automation. These differentiated offerings coupled with the strong go-to-market focus and execution in biologics and genomics help drive Beckman's above market growth during the quarter. At Leica Microsystems, low double digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across North America, Western Europe and China, and solid demand across all major end markets. Leica had positive results across each major product line with good momentum from new product launches like the ARveo Digital Augmented Reality Microscope which provide leading imaging technology for the most complex surgical procedures in the medical end market. Leica's effective application of DBS growth tools have helped the team develop several important new products and improve their commercial execution, a powerful combination that's been a key competitive differentiator for Leica. Core revenue at SCIEX increased at a high-single-digit rate with strength in North America and China, driven by the pharma and clinical testing markets. The SCIEX team is focused recent innovation initiatives on attractive end market opportunities in mass spectrometry like biologics and food testing, producing unique workflow solutions but enhance our competitive advantage and drive continued market share gains. At Pall, the team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth with similar results across both our Life sciences and industrial businesses. Growth was broad-based globally and the team continued to build a strong order book across the business. Biopharma and microelectronics led the way each delivering double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. And we saw a good momentum in our process and industrial business driving mid-single-digit core growth and strong order trends. Our most recent acquisition, IDT, is off to a great start and increased revenue at double-digit rate during the quarter. The team's DBS integration is already facilitating key commercial enhancements and cost efficiencies and we\u2019re excited about this early progress at IDT. In our Diagnostics platform, reported revenue was up 7.5% with core revenue growth of 5%. Reported operating margin increased to 17.7%, including 150 basis points of core margin expansion. Beckman Coulter grew at a low-single-digit rate led by strength across high growth markets. By product line, our immunoassay and chemistry businesses continued to perform well. And we had several exciting new product launches in our hematology business in the second quarter, including the DxH 520 analyzer for low volume settings and the DxH 900 analyzer for high volume with a first of a kind early sepsis indicator. These new analyzers are faster and easy to use with a much smaller footprint. The early sepsis indicator alerts clinicians to an infection sooner of critical capability given the life threatening nature of sepsis. These new hematology solutions are important additions to enhance Beckman\u2019s competitive position in the diagnostics market. Looking across the rest of our diagnostics businesses, Radiometer, Leica, Leica Biosystems and Cepheid each delivered high-single-digit core revenue growth during the quarter. We saw continued strength in North America, Western Europe and China and growth across most major product lines at each of these three operating companies. Across our Diagnostics platform, recent growth initiatives have focused on improving R&D and sales and marketing processes using DBS growth tools like accelerated product development and sales funnel management to help us develop and deliver better solutions for our customers. At Leica Biosystems, we've gained good early traction in a number of recent launches like the BOND RX Advanced Stainer and the PELORIS III Tissue Processing System. At Cepheid, the team's improved commercial execution and continued menu expansion with new tests like the Group A's Strep Xpress test were key drivers of the business's double digit growth in developed markets. This combination of innovation and commercial improvements using DBS helps us expand and differentiate our offerings and contributed to share gains across these businesses during the quarter. Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenue grew 4.5% with core revenue growth of 2%. Our operating profit margin declined to 14.3% and core margins were down 125 basis points due to continued investment spend and productivity initiatives across the platform. Our traditional consumables and equipment business grew for the first time since 2016 and we saw early signs of end market stabilization through the quarter. Growth in China and Western Europe was partially offset by modest declines in North America where inventory adjustments in the distribution channel moderated versus recent quarters. Nobel Biocare led the way in specialty consumables with mid-single digit core growth, driven by good execution in North America and China. Our orthodontics business, Ormco, grew low-single digits. Last month, Ormco launched a full-scale clear aligner system in Australia called Spark, which has received very positive feedback from doctors and patients. Spark aligners combined at Ormco's market leading expertise in creating digital treatment plan with the highly aesthetic orthodontic treatment options. Spark enables Danaher to treat a broad range of patients including those with complex cases. We're pleased with Spark's initial progress in Australia and expect to build upon this early traction to expand our offering going forward. Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 11% with 7% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin declined modestly to 23% and core operating margin declined 50 basis points as a result of accelerated growth investment and productivity initiatives across the platform. We believe these growth investments have helped to sustain and expand our share gains across the segment. In product identification, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate as we saw continued share gains in our marking and coding business. Videojet's core revenue was up high-single digits and all major regions and product lines generated mid-single digit growth or better during the quarter. At our Water Quality platform, core revenue was up high-single digits with the strength of performance broad-based across our water treatment and analytical instrumentation businesses. Hach's core revenue increased at a double digit rate of solid momentum in both the municipal and industrial end-markets. Robust results in the high growth markets was driven by continued demand in China as a result of their active project pipeline. Additionally, Hach's recent innovation investments have focused on our offerings in servility, medical and software solutions. Recent product launches in these areas are helping to drive Hach's continued above market growth rate. Last year, we highlighted Hach's rel0065ased of the Claros Water Intelligent system, a software platform that brings together instruments, data and process management to provide customers a valuable operational insight to manage their water processes in real time. The Hach team uses DBS growth tool like agile software development and commercial launch excellence to enhance Claros capabilities and functionality and to make important go to market adjustments that improve targeting and messaging to drive better commercial performance. Claros is just one example of how Hach is harnessing the power of DBS to accelerate growth and enhance Hach's leadership position in the market. The chemistry mid-single-digit core revenue growth was driven by similar results across the developed and hybrid markets, by end market growth and commercial facilities and primary metals was partially offset by software results in chemical and food and beverage. Lastly, Trojan\u2019s core growth was up high-single-digits with bookings and revenue growth continuing to benefit from momentum in the North American municipal markets. Good commercial executions and recent new product introductions are enabling the team to sustain a strong customer win rate and we believe Trojan gain further market share. So to wrap up, we\u2019re extremely pleased our second quarter results. Our performance is a testament to the team\u2019s execution and passion for continuous improvement helping us deliver 6% core revenue growth, mid-teens EPS growth, 105 basis points of core operating margin improvement and a 22% increase in year-to-date free cash flow. We\u2019re particularly pleased with our continued strong performance on the top-line as DBS growth tools and investments and innovations are helping us to take share in many of our businesses. We\u2019re also very excited about our announcement that will be spinning off our Dental business into a standalone publicly traded company. We think this is an important step to help both Danaher and the Dental business realize greater potential and maximize value for our shareholders, customers and associates. As we look ahead, we believe the strength of our portfolio combined with the power of the Danaher business system provide us with the foundation to deliver long-term shareholder value creation. We\u2019re initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.05 and $1.08, which assumes core revenue growth of approximately 4% to 4.5%. We are raising our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to a range of $4.43 to $4.50 versus our previous range for $4.38 to $4.45. And now expect to achieve mid-single-digit core revenue growth for the full year. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Kina, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll now take our first question from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : A nice quarter. Tom, I want to start with the decision has been Dental now, I guess, given the market pressures, it seems a little bit early, I think the most of our investor discussions people expected this would come in the next couple of years. So I know you've a year to prep. But is this increased confidence in the market picking up? And can you talk a little bit about what needs to happen to get the business ready? And also any comments you want to make on M&A strategy post in and thoughts in a distribution channel 50-50 -- direct distribution rate model long-term for that business? Tom Joyce : Tycho, good morning, and thank you. I think as you heard us update you over the last, really couple of years or more, we've made terrific progress in the business. And as happens in some challenging businesses and market situations, it does take some time but we are now seeing the benefits of that work. We're seeing those results and early indicators around improved cost structure. The growth investments that we made there are now generating some improved growth in our position in the market, improved competitive position. And I think if you've seen on a relative basis where we can show some outperformance. And so I think in many respects, this is really about the progress that we've made and getting our business to a point where we think it really holds a great potential for that progress to manifest itself and to get them on a shareholder value creation overtime. In addition, I think from a market perspective, the dental market has clearly begun to stabilize. And we think a year from now it will be in an even better place. And so with another year similar to what we did at Fortive, we have an opportunity to get the team ready and to ensure that we have all the appropriate steps completed to be a successful profitable company launch just as we did with Fortive. As a standalone company and clearly off a smaller base, acquisitions in organic investments will have a magnified impact on the business, and of course you've seen that at Fortive as well. Acquisitions in the $100 million to $250 million deal range can really move the needle. And some of the investments that we've made organically around things like the IO scanner, the work that we're doing on clear aligners now, those are all going to be more impactful overtime. So we think this is a great opportunity to create long term value for shareholders. It's got a -- what we think is a very attractive earnings profile coming off of low-single digit core revenue growth, solid operating margin expansion with opportunity, plenty of opportunities to go. And in terms of your question about capital and M&A, we're going to set this up as you -- I hope you would expect as an investment grade business with the capabilities to deploy capital through M&A. And certainly in a way that it doesn't hold us back, we continue to be focused on deploying capital at Danaher over the next year and beyond. So this remind us a lot of afford both in terms of timing and in terms of the long term shareholders value creation opportunity whether it's the comparison between the industrial cycle timing in the dental market recovery or the performance of our business getting better and being able to run the Danaher playbook consistently in an independent business. Lastly, your question about distribution, I mean this is the business obviously that has a little bit more of a skew towards going through distribution. Albeit 50-50, Danaher post Dental would be more skewed towards direct more like 75-25, and the distribution channels always going to play an important part I believe in the dental business. But at the same time those direct businesses are superb. And we love those because of the intimacy they have with customers. So I think all in, while the channel structures may evolve slightly overtime, I think both the business and the market are in a much better shape today than they've been in recent times. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then for a follow up, I just want to go back to the quarter for a minute. And if you could just help us bridge the 4% guide with the 6% result, I know you're firing all cylinders, but can maybe just talk if they were sources of supplies are upside relative to your own expectations. Obviously Life Sciences did well against the tougher SCIEX comp, both Environmental & Applied up 7% as well. So can you maybe just talk through some of the underlying momentum in the businesses? Tom Joyce : Sure. Well, I tell you we have terrific momentum in the businesses. As I mentioned 4 out of 5 segments clearly at mid-single-digits and above all of the segments in addition to Dental outperforming our expectations. Good performance. That was a combination of both commercial execution and new product innovation pretty much across the board. As it relates to how we look at the quarter ahead, yes, there\u2019s a little bit of moderation in our Q3 growth rate relative to Q2. There\u2019s probably a 100 basis points of tougher comp in Q3 versus Q2. And yes, as you say, we fired on every cylinder in Q2. And we think it\u2019s probably a little bit prudent to be a bit cautious in our outlook given some of the trade related matters. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get into this here shortly and then some of the broader macro uncertainties if you will. We still remain optimistic about the future. But I think the combination of little bit tougher core growth and it had bit of caution in the macro outlook was prudent relative to the third quarter and balance year guide. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And just to clarify the $0.01 to $0.02, is that from the tariffs and out of the $0.06 to $0.07 headwind in the back half of the year. Is that the right math? Matt Gugino : Yes. The right way to think about that Tycho is on currency versus April, the strengthening of the dollar, probably hit our revenue, second half revenue, about $250 million at a 20% fall so that\u2019s about $0.05, and there is about a penny a quarter of transactional impact from the tariffs. Now that\u2019s before any counter measures and we\u2019re working on a bunch of things, but it's probably going to take a little bit of time for us to get some of those counter measures in place. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : I applaud the decision to spin Dental. It seems to work in the past 4 years so good luck with that. I wanted to backup a little bit. I can\u2019t recall seeing the stronger numbers out of Leica and Hach, just those two businesses explicitly you called out as having new products. And how does -- to help us understand that product cycle a little bit better, I don\u2019t remember in the past team that kind of outgrowth. Was there -- are there timing issues where in fact maybe we should see this moderate a bit or is there\u2019s been some or these products so different or special that this is somewhat game changing for likely better orders? Tom Joyce : Scott these -- both Leica Microsystems and Leica Biosystems as well as Hach, our businesses that have strong track records over a long period of time of creating the market leadership positions that they have created on the back of exceptional products and product differentiation and competitive advantage. We have made some significant progress across not just these businesses but a number of businesses over the last couple of years in improving the approaches that we take to bringing in innovative ideas from the end user and then to execute on those ideas in a more timely and cost effective way. And I think what you're seeing not just in the businesses that you asked about but really across the number of our businesses, the manifestation of a couple of years of work in improving the execution from that front end to bring ideas in all the way to the backend execution and launch and commercialization. Leica, in particular, Microsystems has broadened their new product innovation scope beyond what historically has been a confocal launch cycle. And I think that's making a real different.  At Leica Biosystems, what I mentioned there whether its microtomes, tissue processors, advanced strainers, all of those things are product of a number of process related steps using the tools of DBS to do those simultaneously as appose to somewhat more sequentially. And at Hach, a business that now it's focused much more on ensuring that we deliver higher quality answers to customers through data and data analytics, information and the clearer software system. I think you saw anything to combination of hardware, consumables and data and analytics that is further differentiating that business. So it's a variety of different things but I think the general theme across Danaher has been improving new product execution all the way from the frontend to the backend. Scott Davis : Okay, fair enough. And then I know you -- it's early days in this pair of trade non-sense. But when I think it\u2019s some of your businesses where you're buying a fair amount of components from Asia or even shipping in from Asia to developed markets. Can you start to prepare the markets for price increases to pass that stuff through? I mean how -- if your competitors have similar dynamics, I imagine they do, but I don't know entirely. How do you start to think about at least whether it's through distributors or otherwise getting playing the ground work at least for the fact that you're probably going to have to raise the prices at some point? Tom Joyce : Scott, as you can imagine we're sort of in the early days of all of that. We don't feel that we're in the cross-hairs of where they're really going after but, and in fact there is no one business at Danaher that has a significant impact, but it's a bunch of middle impacts across all the businesses and that adds up to that roughly sort of penny a quarter impact. We're really thinking about countermeasures in four different ways : one would be price; two would be thinking about supply changes; three would be thinking about modification manufacturing locations because we can hit tariffs both ways U.S. to the China and China to the U.S.; and then fourth, there are opportunities sort to seek exemptions around certain areas around the tariffs. They've actually just outlined the process to do that. So I think between those four categories including price, it'll take us a couple of quarters. I think we'll be able to bring that number down. I think the broader question is here does it have a larger impact to the macro environment? And that's more of a -- that's outside the realm of my specialty. Scott Davis : Mine as well. Okay. Thank you, guys. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys, and congrats on both the fantastic quarter and the spin. Maybe first you called out sort of pharmaceutical strength look like math spec as well had a fantastic quarter. It feels like at least last event using gain share in kind of that market and you had really strong product momentum. Maybe just give us a little color on kind a how you're thinking about pharma overall given some of the noise in that market seems like you're growing right through it and it seems like also on the product cycle or share basis. That's an area for outperformance. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Ross. We feel very good about the life science end markets right now. Generally, coming across the board, they look very healthy to us and we are executing quite well in those life science and market. Specifically around your question on pharma or biopharma, it is normalized, yes, is one way to think about it. A year ago, you saw some softness in that market, you saw issues with a couple of big customers, not just ours, but customers that were broadly served through the market, you saw some inventory adjustments. I think a lot of that is past now. So I think we\u2019re in a market that is sort of returned to normal. But normal in the case of biopharma means a very good growth market and you saw that based on the broad-based strength at Pall. Certainly the exposure we have the biopharma at Beck LS, at SCIEX and Mol Dev, all would indicate that things are very much tracking as you would expect in the biopharma market with double-digit growth in Pall, in the biopharma market led by continued strength and single-use technology. So I mean we\u2019re in a very, very good place in a strong market.  On the broader pharma side small molecule continued strength in China certainly due to generic drug regulations. And I would say generally steady growth in the developed markets. Outside of those specific areas around LS, if you think about the applied market, pretty solid there certainly food testing continues to be a good market. The academic market is pretty solid, China up nicely. We don\u2019t have, as you know, we talked about this in the past. A lot of direct funding that comes from NIH. But NIH funding obviously trickles down to the market and the increase in NIH funding should bode well. And then in the areas where we have a bit more of, you might say industrially oriented exposure in life science. For example, if you looked at our mid single-digit core growth at Pall Industrial, good performance there. Market, I think, is pretty steady. But our performance continues to improve. So I think on balance, we feel very good about the life science end markets and specifically the ones you asked about. Geographically, I think, China continues to be the strongest area with double-digit growth there. We\u2019ve added terrific performance in China across the number of our businesses but life science across clinical academic and pharma is strong, in the developed markets pretty stable. And interestingly, just a side note, demand -- we had probably one of the best quarters in Japan we\u2019ve had in certainly, in any kind of recent memory. So on the life science side double-digit core growth so the performance there. Ross Muken : And then maybe second, you\u2019ve done a number of upcoming interesting transactions last few years that were highly growth accretive and it seems like you\u2019re doing quite well. So maybe just an update on IDT, which seems to be after a very strong start in Phenomenex, it seems like Cepheid also had another good quarter. And how you feel like sort of post spin, it feels like the RemainCo, the traditional Danaher that this year would have been growing north of 5. How do we think about the new growth profile of kind of the business now, the Dental, which it had obviously a number of years of some challenges is going to be its own entity to kind of create value on its own? How do you think about what Danaher looks like from here on now the top-line wise at least? Tom Joyce : Sure. As I mentioned very briefly in my prepared remarks and believe me I couldn't given them very more verbal high-5s. The performance at IDT has been terrific thus far. We're thrilled with what the team is doing there. It was a double digit recorded and very much what we expected. And I think that continued very good trajectory for that business. And we have lots of opportunity to improve the commercial execution of that business and continue to work on how we expand that business particularly geographically. So we're off to a very good start. Phenomenex continuing to perform very well. And then Cepheid as you'd mentioned absolutely had a good quarter. But also again it's actually a challenging comp at Cepheid and still had a good quarter. And we expect to see Cepheid's growth rates pick up in the third quarter off the second quarter numbers. So I think each of the new acquisitions, which as you appropriately mentioned, have all been accretive to sort of the fleet average core growth of the business prior to your acquisition, all those are tracking quite well. As we think about Danaher going forward, I think there are a number of factors that I think will contribute to improving our growth profile and are contributing today. Clearly, acquisitions, we just talked about those, but it is about our day in and day out execution as well in businesses that we've owned for some time. And we see continued good performances for businesses that we've owned for 3 or 4 years and businesses that we've owned for 10 and 12 years and more. And so that day in and day execution and, particularly around new product innovation that I just mentioned to Scott, is a contributor. We think we positioned the portfolio in exceptional markets, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, Water Quality, proliferation of packaging and packaging configurations around the world, all of those are terrific positions to be in and with the strong position in the high growth markets. And each of those secular drivers I just mentioned contributing in a magnified way in the high growth markets we think we have a great position there. And then finally, the balance sheet remains in terrific shape. We will virtually paid off a good deal if not all of IDT already this year. And so the balance sheet is ready willing enable to get after continued deployment. And obviously our bias would be to continue to look for opportunities where near term and, certainly long term growth prospects are at or accretive to the portfolio. So I think it's a combination of things as we think about the portfolio ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thank you and good morning. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Doug. Doug Schenkel : In your prepared remarks you noted that Europe and North America have gained momentum since the beginning of the year. Are there any key end markets or product areas that are worth noting in a little more detail? And how would you characterize the outlook for this building momentum to be sustained moving forward, especially given some of the mix macro data coming out of Europe? Tom Joyce : Doug, looking at geographically in the developed markets, I mean, it was pretty broad-based across the portfolio. Just thinking about a couple of businesses that just to name a few that grew double digits in North America in the quarter, in Life Sciences like Microsystems grew double-digits. The other businesses in North America were mid-single-digit growth or slightly better in the case of Europe life science businesses across the board, we\u2019re pretty well solidly in the mid-single-digits. If we look in Diagnostics, clearly Leica Biosystems performed well in both of those markets, Cepheid in both of those markets. So it\u2019s hard to pick out businesses where there was some particular weakness in the developed markets. And that\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re all at the same rate. But generally, as I look across each of the businesses there was quite broad-based. Matt Gugino : Maybe I would add, clock tend to be a reasonably good bellwether because they get both to the industrial and to sort of the government, the municipal side of it. And they were up, I think, high-single-digits both in the U.S. and Europe in the quarter. Some of that's clearly share. We don\u2019t think the markets growing that well. But it does suggest reasonable stability in those regions right now. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Tom Joyce : If I look at another say broad-based player just in a very macro, in context, Doug, if I look at Videojet, mid-single-digit growth solidly, so in North American and actually double-digit growth in Europe, and that\u2019s in the quarter, I mean that\u2019s not necessarily the long-term there, but the point in time good performance. Doug Schenkel : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just for my follow-up and quickly flipping through the 10-Q this morning, it appears pricing was more of a tailwind this quarter than we seen recently in both Life Sciences and EAS, anything to talk about there really. What were the key drivers? Was there anything related to tariffs say price increases that were dropped into the quarter although I would think that would be pretty early? And then how are you factoring this into guidance for the balance of the year? Tom Joyce : Doug, that's unrelated to tariffs. I mean, we clearly are seeing the benefit on the industrial side and you\u2019ve seen that tick up both across our water and PID business. In the healthcare businesses, it has been more challenging. It was a little bit better sequentially. Those businesses, I think will remain challenging to get a lot of price and we\u2019ll continue to be leaning more on the industrial business for price. So I think it\u2019ll take a little bit of time but hopefully we\u2019ll get a little bit more price as potential offset to the tariffs. But that\u2019s not going to kick in here in Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : In the backdrop of the really strong operational performance and interesting transformational opportunity for Dental, I wonder if we could get an update on a question that has been in a more to forefront over the last several months, which is capital deployment for RemainCo. I wonder to what extent it any does the management bandwidth commitment associated with getting Amir and the team ready to Spin. Does that in anyway impact your thinking about capital deployment? And if you could give us any broad-stroke views on how your views on how capital deployment should be executed this year that would be really helpful. Matt Gugino : Sure, Steve. We remain absolutely committed to continuing to deploy our free cash flow and beyond in the interest of the 4 platforms that we will have in RemainCo over the next year. Life Sciences, Diagnostics, PID and Water all stand at the front of the line for capital deployment. And so that has been and will continue to be our bias. As was the case for every during the period, the similar periods, the year that we work to stand at Fortive, we continue to have that bias and focused on deploying capital. So nothing really changes about either our commitment to or our ability to deploy capital in the interest of those 4 platforms going forward. So we feel good about where the balance sheet sits today and we see some interesting opportunities in the pipelines that we continue to review. Steve Beuchaw : Okay, great. Good to hear. And then just two very similar points I wanted to follow up on the businesses. First is a SCIEX, you called out clinical as a growth driver. Once upon a time there were some reimbursement changes that were tougher to clinical business. Can I take your comments to mean that is that part of the business in applied clinical to that not really working now subsequent to those changes maybe. Does that include any benefit from the Topaz launch? And then on Dental, I wonder if you could give us just an update on what you're thinking about organic growth or core growth for the back half of this year and given some of the comments that you made about the improving trends, stabilizing trends that you see in this space? Thanks so much. Tom Joyce : Sure, Steve. So on SCIEX, you're right, we did comment specifically about clinical. And the reference that you made just for others on the call, I know, you're knowledgeable to Steve. Around reimbursement really had to do with what the industry knows and we referred to pain panels or pain management, and changes in reimbursement that go back couple of years now had an impact on portion of the SCIEX business associated with testing for pain management. And as that reimbursement change we sought some slowdown, some declines actually in that clinical business. We have rounded the corn on that if you will. We lap over those comps now. So to some extent we have an easier comp as that reimbursement dynamic is now behind us. And we'll see some incremental growth in our clinical business overtime. And yes, we're very pleased with how Topaz has come out of the blocks. So somewhat early days post that launch, but that and other new product introductions at SCIEX are continuing to contribute to good growth. And relative to Dental going forward and in the back half, I think our view continues to be that that will be a low-single-digit growth rate in the back half. Again, we saw some early indications that we'll see some incremental growth and we saw that in the second quarter. But it still going to be a low-single digit growth as that market continues to stabilize. But our continued improvement in our performance associated particularly with new product innovation and good commercial work. We think even in the face of what may still be a challenging end market should certainly have us on an improving track. Steve Beuchaw : Really appreciate all that. Thank you. Tom Joyce : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin : Dan, good morning. Dan Comas : Good morning. Derik De Bruin : Couple of questions. So just noticed that Cepheid grew high-single digits this quarter, which certainly is lower than it has in the most recent quarters. Just -- can you guys talk about anything unusual there comps just moving from that? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up. Dan Comas : Sure, absolutely. And sorry, I just made a big -- just a path in reference to that, just a couple of minutes ago. Yes, Cepheid grew high-single-digits, actually, a number of very positive factors in terms of new customer acquisition and penetration of new products behind that high-single-digit number. But you\u2019re right lower than the trend line we had. That\u2019s really just a function of challenging comp in the high growth markets or what was formerly referred to as the HBDC or hybrid and developing countries arena. We had some pretty big numbers a year ago on that in one market in particular. And so we fully expected that Cepheid will return and we will see an uptick in that growth in the third quarter back to the 10% range or better that we\u2019ve seen in the past. Tom Joyce : Derik, if you look at the business ex-HBDC and that\u2019s out of 20%, we\u2019re up mid-teens in the core business. Derik De Bruin : Okay. That\u2019s actually the number that's why I was looking for. Great. That makes sense, because you know and if I remember correctly, big NDA order last year or China order? Tom Joyce : Yes. Derik De Bruin : Okay. That puts it into the perspective. And as we\u2019re sort of at mid-year, have you seen any pushback from hospital labs on due to PAMA, just sort of thinking about what capital spending at the hospital labs and just thinking about. Are they working their budgets that they're pushing back to some sort of update now that we have some time to digest? Tom Joyce : Sure. They are clearly watching their budgets. And there are certain situations where we\u2019ve seen some pricing pressure. But I think as I mentioned, right, when PAMA became a reality, Derik, in many respects, this is sort of standard operating procedure in the diagnostics market at least in the large central lab. There is always been a basis for some level of pricing pressure, particularly when you are seeking either new business or renewing your existing business. And so there\u2019s certainly some of those dynamics aren't put, but in the overall scope of our Diagnostics platform and relative to margins, the impact is very, very modest to marginal. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Winoker : Dan, I just, first want to follow up on the tariffs comments you made. That tariffs that you\u2019ve contemplated, is that the only the $50 billion so far or includes the other $200 billion on top of that? Dan Comas : That\u2019s the higher number. Steven Winoker : The higher number, okay. And presumably, should that go to the full about beyond the $200 billion. Have you take, right, not the demand factor. We can\u2019t -- and so we do not, I mean, I don\u2019t know if we can double it, we don\u2019t -- have you quantify that yet? Dan Comas : We\u2019re taking it like you guys as it comes hourly. Steven Winoker : Okay. Tom Joyce : Sitting here at six blocks in the White House doesn\u2019t mean we get the info any quicker than you guys do. Steven Winoker : Yes, I figure one of you withstanding outside sitting with there. Anyway, okay. So now on the Dental split, Tom, I understand the rationale for that. But one of the comments you had made and we\u2019ve seen it play out as the larger impact on M&A on a smaller entity when you do this and given the importance of M&A to the whole model and how that plays out. But why can't I extent that logic even further to the rest of what system side of RemainCo? In other words, if it's true for Dental, why wouldn't that be true for ENAS? Tom Joyce : Well, I think, first of all we love those businesses in terms of their consistencies that those businesses have with the model across the portfolio. They have very similar growth profiles across the 4 platforms. You have very similar margin profiles. You have, in the most cases, much more captive levels of consumables associated with those businesses. And you have a science and technology orientation to those businesses that I think unifies them into a common business model. And so while you certainly can make a case that depending on the size of business, M&A can make more magnified difference in one versus the other. The commonality of the business model I think is what unifies the four platforms going forward. Steven Winoker : Okay, that's very clear. And then just if I could on the business units on Pall, I mean, can you talk a little bit more about the puts and takes on the growth rate there around the different components? And particularly focused on some of the things that maybe kind of holding it back a little bit? Tom Joyce : Well, I think we've seen as I mentioned good performance across Life Sciences with Biopharma very strong, single used technology is very strong. If it was an area in what we broadly describe is Life Sciences that wouldn't be really growing at quite the rates that we see in Biopharma and SET. It probably would be the smaller portions of the Life Sciences segment which are life science businesses at Pall which will be the lab food and beverage business and the medical businesses. And again those are smaller but obviously are not posting the same growth rates. And then as I mentioned on the industrial side, really good performance in Micro that's been consistent for a long time. And then the fluids oriented process business, we're starting to see some better performance there and that's largely more a function of our execution. If there was a softer part of the industrial side of Pall, probably would be on the aerospace side. But we have a very strong competitive position there nevertheless. Dan Comas : And Steve, as we've alluded to, bookings have been very strong. And part of that play down Q2. Q2 was 200 basis points better than Q1. And we expect another kind of comparable sort of step up here in Q3. So we feel a lot of momentum there and our shipments actually sort of understate what we're really seeing in the business today. As you know that can be a little bit more of the lag business. Steven Winoker : Right, that's helpful. And then finally that core operating margin contraction in the 2 businesses Dental and EAS, in terms of you explained that that was investments and productivity spending, but how much longer should we anticipate that continuing? Tom Joyce : Well, I mean, it's a little bit dependent on what we're seeing in the quarter because we saw a lot of strength by mid-quarter and businesses like Dental and EAS that had both productivity opportunities and growth opportunities, we sort to say go after to where things are trending well, so little bit of that dynamic. But I think on the EAS, we'll begin to sort to see that get better. Dental, we're going to be doing some things to really, to make like we did in Florida to make sure we're set up welcome next July. Operator : Our final question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Just one question on Dental. I would be curious to hear if the channel dynamics were still a negative drag on the top-line in 2Q? And if you could elaborate kind of on traditional consumables sellout trends in both the U.S. and Europe? Tom Joyce : Sure. Brandon as I mentioned, I think we\u2019re in a much more stable environment right now, relative to the channel dynamics that you asked about. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that what we talked about in the past about channel related inventory adjustments had moderated significantly during the course of the first half of this year. So I think the vast majority of that is behind us. I always had to take to say that we\u2019ve never seen the inventory adjustments. Again, because I think that the distribution channels always going to be somewhat sensitive the distribution based on what sellout looks like. And so I think, in general, we\u2019re in a much better place and the vast majority of that is behind us. The realignment of the sort of the preferential exclusives or the unwinding of those exclusives is better said, I think now is largely behind us. There\u2019s still obviously some ramp of new sales forces in with different distribution partners could have an impact on growth rates. But in general, I think, that\u2019s starting to normalize as well. So I think when you take those things together and then you look at what was our core growth rate and some improving sellout, I think we\u2019re just in a much better place today Operator : That will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Gugino. Please go ahead. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Kina, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We\u2019re around all day for questions. Operator : That will conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. We have built terrific momentum throughout 2018 and this continues in the third quarter with our team delivering results ahead of expectations. We achieved 6.5% core revenue growth, solid operating margin expansion, and double-digit earnings per share growth. Our outstanding top-line performance was broad-based, and we\u2019re particularly pleased with the number of our businesses that delivered 5% or better core growth. Through the first nine months of this year, we delivered 6% core growth, a result achieved through a combination of new product innovation, strong commercial execution, and strategic acquisitions which has increased our exposure to attractive end markets. Our team\u2019s performance utilizing the Danaher business system is enabling us to innovate more effectively and to get better products and solutions to our customers sooner, all of which we believe is contributing to sustainable market share gains. So turning to our third quarter results, sales increased 7% to $4.9 billion with the impact of currency translation, decreasing revenue by 1.5% and acquisitions adding 2%. Core revenue was up 6.5% with four of the five platforms delivering mid-single-digit or better core growth. Third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.10, representing 10% growth year-on-year. We generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date resulting in a free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio of 123%. Geographically, high growth markets revenue was up double-digits with China and India leading the way. In developed markets, mid-single-digit growth was led by momentum in North America and Western Europe. Our gross margin for the third quarter was 55.4%, while core operating profit margin expanded 50 basis points. During the quarter, both gross and operating margins were negatively impacted by volatile currently movements, particularly in a number of the high growth market countries. Year-to-date, our gross margin is up 60 basis points, and we\u2019ve increased our core operating margin by 100 basis points led by our Life Sciences, Diagnostics, and Environment & Applied Solutions segments. So now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our third quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 14.5% and core revenue was up 9.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 19.6% with 230 basis points of core margin improvement. This is the platform\u2019s ninth consecutive quarter of more than 100 basis points of core margin improvement. So, turning to the individual operating companies, Beckman Life Sciences delivered high-single-digit core revenue growth with positive results across most major product lines and geographies. The team\u2019s strong commercial performance and recent new product launches focused on higher growth biologics and genomics markets are helping Beckman increase their customer win rate, and we believe they continue to gain share relative to the market. At SCIEX, high-single-digit core revenue growth was led by North America and China. We saw strength across the pharmaceutical and food testing end markets in both regions, driven in part by demand for SCIEX\u2019s recently launched X500 mass spec platform. Core revenue at Leica Microsystems was up high-single digits. The combination of strong end markets in life science, research, and industrial applications along with momentum from recent product launches drove solid demand across all major product lines. Pall had a great quarter, producing double-digit core revenue growth. The team\u2019s execution combined with good underlying market conditions contributed to positive results in every business unit. In particular, our biotech business, including single-use technologies was up mid-teens in the quarter. In September, many of you braved the rain to attend our investor event at Pall\u2019s Westborough, Massachusetts facility. We provided an update on the business and highlighted what the Pall team has accomplished with DBS since the acquisition. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress accelerating and focusing our innovation efforts, enhancing commercial initiatives, and reducing costs. In the three years since the acquisition, Pall has already achieved more than $250 million of annual cost savings out of our five year $350 million target, helping to increase gross margins close to 500 basis points and operating margins by more than 800 basis points. Pall has taken some of these cost savings and reinvested into R&D and sales initiatives helping double the amount of annual revenue achieved from new products since acquisition and improving market visibility by 50%. The team has done a tremendous job using DBS to drive meaningful and sustainable results across the business and we could not be more pleased with Pall\u2019s achievements so far. Six months ago, we acquired IDT, a leading player in the genomics consumables market and the business is off to a great start as part of Danaher, delivering mid-teens revenue growth in the quarter. At the time of acquisition, we talked about IDT's opportunities to evolve their go-to-market strategy and the team has already made meaningful progress with the help of DBS growth tools like sales funnel management. We\u2019re excited about IDT\u2019s start as part of Danaher and we look forward to their continued progress. In our Diagnostics platform, reported revenue was up 3.5% with core revenue growth of 5.5%. Reported and core operating margin declined 120 basis points to 15.6%, which was primarily driven by transactional losses stemming from the significant weakening of certain high growth market currencies against the US dollar during the quarter. Beckman Coulter\u2019s core revenue growth was up low-single digits with strength in China, partially offset by softness in the developed markets. Looking across our product lines, growth was driven by immunoassay and strength in automation. At the Annual AACC trade show in Chicago this past July, we featured our recently launched hematology products, including the DxH 520 analyzer for low volume settings and the DxH 900 analyzer for high volume applications with the first of its kind Early Sepsis Indicator. We\u2019ve been very encouraged by the market reception of these new hematology products. Beckman also recently launched the DxA 5000, a new clinical lab automation solution that reduces the number of manual steps for a lab tech from 32 to 1. We expect this advancement to help drive meaningful cost savings in the laboratory while simultaneously improving lab quality and turnaround time for faster diagnoses and better patient outcomes. As we enhance our product offering with differentiated solutions for our customers, we believe that Beckman will continue to improve its competitive position and growth profile over time. Radiometer achieved another quarter of high single-digit core revenue growth with solid performance across our blood gas and AQT product lines. Geographically, results were led by China, Japan and North America where recent customer wins contributed to meaningful gains in the US. Core revenue at Leica Biosystems was up high single-digits driven by broad-based strength across the core histology and Advanced Staining businesses. LBS is benefiting from recent new product launches like the PELORIS III Tissue Processing System, which addresses our pathology customers\u2019 key workflow challenges and in turn helps improve their lab processes and efficiency. Cepheid delivered double-digit core revenue growth and continued to be an innovation leader during the quarter. The team added to hepatitis B assay in Europe, which rounds out Cepheid\u2019s virology test menu offering in the region. And in July, Cepheid announced the launch of the GeneXpert Edge, a portable battery-operated point-of-care system specifically developed for near patient testing in developing countries, starting with tuberculosis testing in India and Africa. TB test results on the Edge are available in less than two hours and supported and support a localized single visit test and treat approach to advance the goal of eradicating tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. Turning to our Dental segment, reported revenue was down 2% and core revenue declined by 50 basis points. Reported operating profit margin declined 200 basis points to 12.7% and core margins were down 195 basis points. These margin declines were due to lower sales volume, currency impact from the recent strengthening of the US dollar and investment spend as we help prepare DentalCo for a successful spin-off in the second half of 2019. Core growth in our traditional consumables and equipment business was down in the quarter, driven by expected inventory adjustments in North American distribution channel along with modest declines in Europe and Japan. However, we remain encouraged by signs of end market stabilization as North American sellout data in both the traditional consumables and equipment product lines was positive in the quarter. Our specialty consumables business was up mid single-digits with solid performance across orthodontics and implants led by Nobel Biocare. At Ormco, we recently received FDA 510(NYSE:K) clearance for Spark, our full-scale clear aligner system. Ormco had initially launched Spark in Australia back in June and obtaining this US clearance is an important step to expand our offering going forward. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported and core revenue both grew 8%. Reported operating margin increased 130 basis points to 23.7%, including 160 basis points of core margin expansion. In Product Identification, core revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate. Videojet delivered high single-digit core revenue growth marking their 11th consecutive quarter of mid single-digit or better core growth. Earlier this week at Pack Expo, North America's largest packaging event, Videojet showcased several new printers and technologies including the 1580 Continuous Inkjet Printer. The CIJ 1580 is Videojet's newest mid range offering and we've developed using technology from the 1860 high speed printer. The 1580 provides better connectivity and remote service capabilities for the mid range segment, helping customers reduce their total cost of ownership. By leveraging the existing technology from the 1860 printer, Videojet was able to develop and launch the 1580 in under a year, expanding our Continuous Inkjet offering and providing a broader range of solutions for our customers. In July, Esko closed the acquisition of BLUE Software, a label and artwork management software company. Esko solutions digitize, automate and connect the packaging development and production workflow, from 3D design concepts all the way to printed packaging, point-of-sale displays and e-commerce content. The team is constantly seeking ways to reduce time to market while improving cost and quality across the packaging value chain. The BLUE Software acquisition further enhances Esko's unique offering in this critical process and we're excited to have the BLUE team on board. At our Water Quality platform, core revenue was up double-digits and the strength of performance was broad-based across our water treatment and analytical instrumentation businesses. Hach had a terrific quarter with double-digit core revenue growth. The Chinese Government's prioritization of water quality has generated significant demand for Hach's offering and helped drive growth of more than 30% in the region. And we saw a solid momentum across both the industrial and municipal end markets in the US and Europe as well where we believe that the team's strong commercial execution is contributing to market share gains. On our second quarter call, in July, we talked about the recently launched Claros Water Intelligent system, Hach's software platform that brings together instruments, data and process management. Claros was recently selected by one of the nation's largest wastewater operations to support their extensive system of treatment plants. Claros will be used to ensure accurate data collection and management from dozens of sources, helping to standardize compliance reporting and provide actionable insight for improved process operations. At ChemTreat, core revenue growth improved sequentially to mid single-digit rate led by increased demand in the metals and mining, food and beverage markets. And lastly Trojan's core revenue was a high single-digits as we continued to see good demand across the municipal end markets in North America. We believe the Trojan team continues to take share relative to the market driven by their differentiated product offering and recent commercial initiatives. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with our third quarter results and the momentum we generated throughout 2018. Our performance is a testament to the team's execution and drive for continuous improvement, helping us achieve 6% core revenue growth, a 100 basis points of core margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth through the first nine months of 2018. We continued to deliver strong top-line results as recent acquisitions, investments in innovation and DBS growth tools have driven better performance and share gains across many of our businesses. Our solid balance sheet positions us well to further enhance our portfolio through inorganic opportunities in 2018 and beyond. The spin-off of our Dental business remains on track and we\u2019re excited about the progress the team is making as we help them prepare to become a standalone publicly traded company in the second half of next year. Looking ahead, we remain focused on building a stronger better Danaher. We believe the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, combined with the power of the Danaher business system provides us with the foundation to create sustainable long-term shareholder value. We are initiating fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS guidance in the range of $1.25 to $1.28, which assumes core revenue growth of approximately 4%. And we are raising our full year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $4.49 to $4.52, which would represent our fourth consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. David, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Tom, maybe I want to start off -- kicking off on your last comment there about double-digit earnings growth. I guess thinking a little bit further out beyond the fourth quarter in light of some of the FX moves and tariffs and maybe a lighter flu season, can you talk about your view of sustainability of double-digit earnings growth as we think ahead to maybe 2019? Tom Joyce : Sure, Tycho, well we don't get too far ahead of ourselves here. We still have plenty of work to do here to finish up a good -- really good 2018. And clearly, as you point out, I mean there are a whole series of things to be concerned about out in the market around as you say FX and tariffs, potentially even in inflation trends as we go forward. But in general, I mean we feel really good about the macro environment today, and in addition to that, the positioning of each of our businesses around those macro drivers. So, I think as we look across certainly geographically, we see strength across virtually every major geography. If there was any weakness at all, it might be a little bit in the Middle East. But otherwise, if we look across, great performance in China, terrific performance across a number of the other high-growth markets despite the currency fluctuations, and good solid performance in the US and Europe. Things like FX and tariffs clearly represent some headwinds to the EPS number, but we feel good about how we\u2019re positioned to continue to drive growth and share gains in our markets. So, we don\u2019t see anything that could get in our way other than those, those few headwinds that we just mentioned. Tycho Peterson : And then maybe just one follow-up on margins on Dental in particular, you talked about incremental investments ahead of the spin. Could you maybe just parse out how much of the market impact was FX versus some of those investments? And how should we think about the incremental investments for Dental in the next couple of quarters? Tom Joyce : Sure, well, we clearly saw some OMX headwind there. FX, both one-time transactional losses and translation associated with the stronger US dollar were contributors to the 195 that we talked about. You know, those high growth market currency fluctuations are likely to continue as we see it today. The FX was nearly 100 basis points of negative impact to core OMX in Dental. The balance of that was in some respect still related to the lower sales volume, especially the higher margin traditional consumables business, but again we felt really good about what we saw in terms of the sellout in North America. Some of the weakness that we saw was in Europe, specifically in Germany, and a little bit of disruption in Japan associated with some of the weather-related issues that we saw there, but in general, we were actually somewhat encouraged by what we saw relative to obviously a large portion of business which is in North America and that sellout. Finally, we are continuing to invest, and that is having some impact on the OMX there. We think it\u2019s important that we setup that business for a better growth profile as it becomes a public company next year. Those investments are clearly in the aligner business, the Spark clear aligner business. We are ramping up associated with our intraoral scanner and our digital dentistry efforts as well as some sales force expansion at Nobel and Ormco. And so, I think the combination of those things we think are make-sense investments that sets that business up well. And in general, we would expect some sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter and certainly in 2019. So, we think it\u2019s still an attractive OMX story certainly as growth continues. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Maybe, Tom, you called out on the Pall business. It seemed like that was up mid-teens. I know we had some slightly easier comps but that still seems like a fantastic result I guess. I know you showed it off that recently, but in terms of the sustainability of demand on kind of the filtration and bioprocess side, how are you feeling about sort of duration of growth there? And kind of what's driving it in terms of single-use in some of the other items? Tom Joyce : Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Ross. We saw broad-based strength across Pall in the quarter. The biotech business clearly led the way at -- with mid-teens kind of growth. Our life science business, specifically if you breakout biotech and the medical and food and beverage business, solid across the board, but tremendous strength in single-use technologies. Even if you look over to the industrial side of the business, better than 10% growth on the industrial side. Microelectronics, continued strength there, a double-digit growth, which by the way has been sustained for seven of the last eight quarters. Obviously, that will start to moderate a little bit as the comps get tougher. But in general, we are seeing good growth across the industrial side with aerospace being solid as well, admittedly off somewhat of an easier comp. So we clearly have a tougher comp in the fourth quarter. We did 10% or better in the fourth quarter of \u201817. So -- but we\u2019ve got good order trends. We think Pall continues to be a solid mid-single-digit growth business, but the biotech business is going to continue to lead the way. And if you think about the underlying drivers there, we talked about this you know I think extensively, Ross. The large molecule dynamic which underpins a lot of the growth that we\u2019re seeing at Pall throughout our life science businesses as well on continues to be strong. You\u2019ve got 350 drugs moving through there but significantly more than that in the pipeline today. And we think that bodes well for a long-term growth track around large molecule drug production and development and production that will benefit certainly the biotech business at Pall but will benefit us more broadly across our other life science businesses as well. Ross Muken : And I guess how are you thinking about sort of the M&A environment and the balance sheet I think in the next year. I mean the cash flow continues to be tremendous. You\u2019ve mainly done tuck-ins let\u2019s say in the last 24 months after Cepheid. It feels like the capacity is sort of there but obviously valuation of this market can be tough. How are you thinking about sort of the funnel and kind of large and small transactions and how you think about your capacity? Tom Joyce : Well, we certainly think we have tremendous capacity today. We\u2019ve basically paid off IDT with our year-to-date free cash flow to this point at a relatively low kind of 2 times leverage number today and that\u2019s going to go lower with our free cash flow generation, which is likely to be in excess of 3 billion this year. We\u2019ve got tremendous firepower. The pipeline is good, it\u2019s been solid. We\u2019ve had tremendous conversations across a number of the platforms and we think there's opportunities in both small and large transactions. Sure, valuations are relatively rich today, but we continue to keep our eyes open for the best and most attractive assets in the market. And with the balance sheet being in the shape it\u2019s in and the multi-industry structure that we have today, which as you know gives us optionality in terms of how we deploy that capital over time, we think we\u2019re in really good shape. Dan Comas : And Ross I think also on the margin, a little bit more anxiety in the market helps. In addition to rising interest rates, we\u2019re much less interest rate sensitive than lower credit companies and private equity. So rising rates should help us here as -- towards the end of the year and going into next year as it relates to M&A. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : So we\u2019ve got a couple different headwinds we\u2019re dealing with here. I mean currency is always a challenge I guess in this new world we live in but tariffs is about to snap us in the face it seems. And last quarter, you\u2019ve talked about hopefully are trying to -- at least you implied you\u2019d get price after 3Q. How do you -- what's your playbook here, I mean do you go out with price increases now and/or do you need to wait until the actual tariffs kick in and get a real time and what do you think the competitive response is going to be if you guys are out there leading into this? Tom Joyce : Yes. Well, Scott, we certainly never wait on price. Tariffs or no tariffs, our business is focused on getting price in the markets on a consistent basis. We are seeing that price come through particularly across Life Sciences and our Environmental & Applied Solutions business. If you look specifically at the consumables side of those businesses where we typically have gotten price, those are high value consumables with relatively modest cost impact to the end customer. Those are -- that\u2019s an important leverage point for us, has been in the past and we will continue to be associated with any headwind relative to tariffs. I mean on tariffs specifically just the baseline where we are right now, I mean we don\u2019t see ourselves as being significantly in the crosshairs of the tariffs that have been put out. We said in July, at that time that we thought it was about $10 million a quarter. Now with the incremental tariffs that have been levied, we expect that to be closer to $12 million to $13 million a quarter. And so on a $5 billion EBITDA base are relatively small numbers. But again that doesn\u2019t take away any pressure we put on ourselves to continuously get price in the market. Price is one of the actions obviously that we address. But we are also looking at where might we do some changes in supply chains, where might we shift some manufacturing to various locations? We have some flexibility there, particularly associated with consumables. And we are pursuing the exemption process that we talked about. And while that\u2019s not necessarily an easy road with the US trade representative, there may be some opportunities there. So it\u2019s a multi-pronged effort but price clearly is part of that. I would say what we\u2019ll probably be a little bit more concerned about and reason for a bit of caution relative to the tariff narrative would be more of the second derivative impact on growth. We haven\u2019t seen much of that right now. You have seen tremendous strength in our China business to this point. I mean China was up double-digit in the third quarter and it was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for us. So right now we feel pretty good about where we are in China. But there's certainly room for a little bit of caution relative to any -- as I said second derivative impact on growth coming out of those markets. Scott Davis : That\u2019s a good answer. And just a quick follow-up. I -- hopefully you can answer this. But am I to assume that Dental is a dual track sell or spin? Tom Joyce : No. We are -- our intention is to spin the business AKA the Fortive transaction of a couple of years ago where Dental becomes a standalone public company in the second half of next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin : Just a follow-up on the trade question I guess. Are you seeing any signs of pull forwards in your customers amidst some of the strength attributed to just people sort of stepping up their ordering anticipation sort of being the tariff? Tom Joyce : We have not seen anything that we could point to specifically Derik. That doesn't mean that there could be something deeper in the order book or the revenue side that represent a very modest level of that but we can't point to anything of any significance there. The biggest number that you heard me talk about in China was in the Water Quality platform at Hach where we saw just a tremendous quarter and we have seen a great year for Hach and Water Quality in China. That\u2019s really more driven by policy associated with surface water in China right now and that -- we could see some continuation to that here in the fourth quarter potentially and then moderate a bit from there. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily describe that in any way as a pull forward at the moment. Derik De Bruin : Great. And just a question, can you talk a little bit about the biopharma end market? I\u2019m just curious on your SCIEX strengths and maybe if anything is going on there and also Phenomenex, can you sort of talk about it? The demand you\u2019re seeing mostly is it broad-based in biopharma, is it big companies, small companies, US, China, India, just a little bit more color on what's going on in that market and some of the share dynamics going on there? Tom Joyce : Sure, sure, absolutely. Yes, we\u2019ve seen very broad-based good performance across the life science business. You asked specifically about SCIEX, so I will touch on that for just a minute. SCIEX posted another quarter of high single-digit core growth. North America and China were both good markets for us. As you know well, Derik, SCIEX has a fairly broad end market reach. And so, it's not just in biopharma but we\u2019re in obviously small and large molecule. That was a very good market for us in the quarter and has been. China remains very strong there specifically. But the applied market has been good, solid numbers in the US around food testing but China and India strength as well. In clinical, China continued to lead the way there, but pretty good performance I think across the board. Academic, not a big business for SCIEX but Europe was solid and China was strong as well. So I think across the board that business was terrific. I touched on Pall earlier and Pall being a little bit more closely aligned with large molecule drug production, and as I mentioned based on the drug pipeline that\u2019s going to be pretty consistent going forward. If you look across the other life science businesses, each of them performed well. I touched on a number of them in my comments. But if I look at that -- the performance of that -- those businesses geographically, I mean pretty much across the board those businesses performed really well geographically, like a micro SCIEX, Beck LS, Pall. And then when you turn to the smaller businesses like Phenomenex, Agela, et cetera, each of those were pretty solid in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good morning and thanks for the time here. The first thing I'd like to do is just given the comments on currency, follow up there just a little bit. I wonder -- I'm sorry if I missed this but could you give us a view on what currency was to EBIT margins, the total company level in the quarter? And then any view on either at the margin line or on the bottom-line as to what currency might have as an impact on the company's profile over the next 12 months or for '19, whatever makes more sense for you? Dan Comas : Yes, Steve, the impact in the third quarter was our core margins were up 50 basis points. We think excluding currency they would have been up kind of well over 75 basis points. To call that 30 plus basis points, that's a combination of the translation which is just the strengthening of the dollar particularly in high growth markets where we have a fair amount of revenue and very modest cost base, but that was exacerbated in the quarter by a bunch of transactional items. The swings in whether it was Brazil or Turkey or Argentina where you had 20% swings and all of a sudden we're marking to market, sorry, I got a cold here, but marking to market a receivable and you\u2019re taking a FX hit. So, my guess is we've got a couple of quarters to kind of bleed through all this. More on the translational side, the transactional side is -- what happens intra-quarter, but there will be a little bit of a headwind over the next couple of quarters. I think we can overcome it, but it will be a little bit of a headwind here. Steve Beuchaw : Bottom-line, I wonder if you could frame up for us in an environment in 2018 where the top-line has been very, very strong, to what extent you might have stepped up any commercial investments that position you for better top-line next year or maybe set you up for potentially some moderation of growth investments such that we could see a slightly different profile in terms of drop through from top-line to EBIT? Thanks so much. Tom Joyce : Well, Steve, we've continued to take advantage of the strength that we've seen in the top-line and the terrific operating margin expansion that we've had to continue to invest in our businesses for exactly the purpose that underlied your question which is continuing the momentum of building on growth the way we have. Obviously, the comparison between growth rates of 2016 and 2017 versus 2018 suggest that those investments have been well placed to this point and we continue to do that throughout 2018 to set ourselves up well for a continuation in 2019. We've already talked about a couple of headwinds here today. Obviously, as we go into the beginning of next year, those growth investments are going to become that much more important. We've got a pretty challenging comp in the first quarter, maybe even in the first half, certainly a strong flu season this year and the Diagnostic business that's up for a more challenging comp going into the first quarter of next year, but hey, we've got to continue to play offense, drive growth. We've seen tremendous progress relative to new product innovation across our businesses, business-by-business platform-to-platform we have seen every one of our businesses increase their investments in new product innovation and the commercialization associated with those and that's been a contributor and that's -- we've talked, referenced in the past the term the Danaher playbook where we're continuing to stay tight on the G&A side and continuing to take some of that growth fall through that's associated with operating margin expansion and put that back into sales and marketing and R&D and so far so good. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Just a handful of diagnostic questions. First, you indicated in your prepared remarks that Beckman faced some headwinds in developed markets. I'm curious if this was just more of the same or whether there were some more pronounced headwinds that occurred during the quarter and that were kind of unique from recent trend and if so if you provide a little more detail? Second, you indicated that FX was having a more pronounced impact on diagnostic margins than some of your other segments in your prepared remarks. I'm just wondering if FX is impacting demand in emerging markets as well and if so, what steps you're taking to mitigate the demand effect? And then third, based on the 10-Q our quick read of that, it looks like the impact of pricing was negative for diagnostics for the first time in at least seven quarters. Could you provide a bit more detail on what drove the pricing pressure particularly as it relates to lab reimbursement pressures and if this is really a US dynamic versus something you're seeing in other geographies? Tom Joyce : Look, Doug that is a handful. I actually had to be taking notes during your question. So, I hope I got it right. So let me take a fling at it. If I missed something I know you'll bring me back. Doug Schenkel : I will help you out. Okay, sounds good. Tom Joyce : Okay, thanks. I have to admit Doug, on the first one, I don't -- I'll have to go back through my prepared remarks. I do not recall talking about anything in particular that was a headwind to the top-line at Beck Dx. We've had pretty solid performance there both geographically and across product lines. I know I highlighted the strength in immunoassasy as well as automation. I'm going to come back to automation in a minute. We're seeing good customer retention at Beck Dx. We're seeing continued improvement in our customer win rates. And so in general, I feel pretty good about that, but you'll bring me back if I missed something there. Dan Comas : Doug, our overall developed market demand at Beckman in Q3 was comparable to what it was in the first half? We didn't mean to suggest any shift. Tom Joyce : Yes. Moving to Dx margins, we did note that the Dx core OMX was down 120 basis points. Significant impact there on the currency side and we'll get into more of that in your questions in a minute both transactional and translational due to the strong US dollar, Dan just talked about the differences between those two and we'll probably see some continuing effect in the fourth quarter and/or the first half driven by the stronger US dollar. But ex the FX impact, core OMX would have been roughly flat year-on-year. So it would've had a pretty significant impact there. In the meantime though, coming back to what I was just commenting on about some investment spend, we continue to ramp up investment spend around particularly hematology because that's an area where we need to enhance our competitiveness and the 900 and the 520 are big parts of that as well as investments in automation and that's really critical because we compete most importantly in those large high volume accounts, we're bolting automation to the floor for long-term customer retention. It is pretty important. So overall, we feel good about how we're investing particularly at Beck Dx. Coming though to your question about demand FX, right now, we couldn't point to anything in particular associated with those FX impacts relative to demand. So far, demand looks pretty steady across our markets. And finally, relative to pricing, in general, we have not seen PAMA have any significant impact from a pricing standpoint. We know and I have always acknowledged that there are pricing pressures in the Dx market consistently. Every time there's a jump off associated with retaining or competing for new accounts, pricing and total cost of ownership is critical, but specific price-related impacts associated with PAMA have been quite, quite modest to this point. One of the impacts that we did see in the quarter associated with what might be considered price within OMX, but really isn't is associated with that automation business where we had a particularly strong quarter in terms of automation, that comes in at a slightly lower margin, but is so important strategically because when you install automation in large volume accounts, it creates a tremendous long-term relationship associated with that capital infrastructure. So in terms of how we balance pricing relative to our competitiveness, we feel pretty good about how the team is doing there. Doug Schenkel : Alright, that's great. You hit all three perfectly. So thanks for rattling through those, appreciate the help. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Q - Julian Mitchell Hi, good morning. Just the first question maybe on Environmental & Applied Solutions, we haven't touched on that too much yet. Your margins in that business or the core margins had been under some pressure, they came back very, very strongly in the third quarter. Just wondered if you now think that we're past those headwinds on investments for the next sort of year or so and whether there was anything on mix particularly helping the margins in Q3 or there's kind of decent sort of triple-digit core OMX increase maybe sustainable for some time? Dan Comas : Julian, I think we have gone through a period of very heavy investment both in water and PID. We've seen the benefit of that a number of new products and you see in the growth number. We did get the mix benefit here at Hach. Hach had an exceptionally strong quarter as you know that's one of our most profitable businesses. So I don't think we'll necessarily replicate hitting Q3 going forward, but I think we're back to a point of more normalized call it 50 basis points of kind of annual margin expansion in that segment. Julian Mitchell : Understood, thank you. And then my second question just around Dental, the issues in the US I guess are fairly well understood and not particularly new, but you talked about some softness in Europe and maybe Germany in particular, maybe just given a little bit of color as to how that played out in recent months. What you think drove that and where you see sort of sell-in versus sell-through dynamics in Europe right now in Dental? Tom Joyce : Sure, Julian. Yes, the softness in Europe was largely associated with Germany. That market is a bit more skewed toward the equipment side of the house and there were some underlying dynamics associated with cost that Dental organizations were having to deal with. Unrelated to our business in Germany during the course of the last quarter or two. And so, we saw that impact in terms of a pullback on purchasing particularly of capital equipment, and again largely in Germany. So we don't see necessarily a broad-based issue in Europe. In fact, over time, we've actually worked to improve our competitive positioning in Europe and have seen the fruits of some of those labors and investments to this point. So we think we'll get through this German phenomenon here in the third quarter -- in the fourth quarter, but it was fairly isolated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Brennan with UBS. Daniel Brennan : Hey, Tom and Dan, congrats on the quarter. So I was hoping you can spend a little more time on China. Seven consecutive quarters double-digit growth, impressive. So I guess two questions. First, beyond Hach, were there any big deviations in the growth rates amongst your different businesses in China in this quarter? And then secondarily, from what you are seeing is there anything that would lead you to think that double-digit growth can be sustained going forward? Tom Joyce : Sure, thanks, Dan. You know, Dan, it was really broad-based. I had looked at it literally operating company-by-operating company and almost without exception we saw a strong growth in China and in many, many of those cases that double-digit growth was driven across a number of different operating companies. So we've talked about the strength that Hach delivered. But if you looked across a number of our other businesses, you'd see that double-digit growth in China and you'd see examples of that in each of the five segments. In terms of the sustainability of it, yes, as you point out, and I had mentioned seven consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, I think that's likely to be sustained at least in terms of what you might consider to be very high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth. There's the uncertainty that we talked about earlier in Scott's question associated with what the second derivative impact might be associated with growth rates in China if the trade issues and associated narrative starts to impact psychology a bit more. But I think at this point, things look pretty consistent, underlying order rates that we look at across the five segments all look pretty good. So at this point, I think we're okay. Daniel Brennan : Great. And maybe just one follow-up on a different topic, just on Beckman, I know we just addressed it in one of the prior questions, but when you think about the outlook for Beckman, they go from low-single where it is today toward improving. I know you shared the hematology theme. But maybe can you give us a little bit of a pathway toward where Beckman could get to over the next couple of years and what are the drivers? Thank you. Tom Joyce : Sure. I think you mentioned one of the key ones and we have talked about this before that across the various product lines where Beckman competes, hematology has been the weakest and the investment that we've made over the last several years and now with these new products coming to market. While it will take a while for those to ultimately impact the core growth, hematology certainly is a lever of ours. In addition, as we continue to perform well in immunoassay, we will continue to you might say mix upward our core growth rate. As you probably know, we're more highly indexed to clinical chemistry at Beckman than some of our diagnostic competitors. And as a result of that with a lower growth rate associated with the clinical chemistry market versus immunoassay, that is a little bit of a drag on our growth rate. As we continue to grow at or above the market in immunoassay, we will mix up our relative growth rate to the market and I think the combination of those two things are two of the biggest factors that will continue to drive us more closer to mid single-digit. One last point though I think it's important to recognize, we're often compared with the larger player or large players in the diagnostic market, you know those names well. The numbers that they tend to put up, it's important to probably compare those numbers broadly to an equivalent portfolio at Danaher which really is the combination of Beckman, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, and importantly, now with our higher exposure to molecular diagnostics at Cepheid, you now look at a portfolio that I think on a full year basis and Dan or Matt will correct me if I'm wrong is out of 6.5% growth rate, on a full year basis, if you look at that combined portfolio in diagnostics. And so, we feel very about how that portfolio has evolved in terms of now positioning us in a very competitive way relative to the overall diagnostic market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. A couple of questions on Dental here I guess, are we past some of the distributor destocking headwinds I guess at this point and how would you characterize underlying demand trends in the US in particular and visibility thereon and how some of those relationships are progressing from a dental distribution standpoint? Thanks. Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks, Erin. I think we are past the most significant adjustments associated with inventories in the channel. So in other words, that is largely behind us. It doesn't mean that they are gone forever. I know you know well what life is like in large distributors, inventories are critically important. There are always going to be pressures associated with adjusting inventories appropriately, particularly with large distributors like we have in the dental industry, but we're through the big impacts there and we're particularly encouraged by the underlying demand that you asked about and that's specific to North America. We get very good transparency associated with sellout in North America and the recent numbers associated with sellout in North America, both in consumables and in equipment, have us quite encouraged in terms of the stabilization of the overall dental market and obviously a very important market that being the North American market. The relationship with distribution have settled down, much of the inventory adjustments that were associated with the shifting of exclusives between large manufacturers and large distributors, that's behind us. Sales organizations have settled into place in terms of the focus of the product lines where we compete and I think that disruption again is largely, if not, completely behind us. Erin Wright : Okay. And then one last quick one. I guess how quickly can you ramp up the clear aligner offering and do you anticipate this being a meaningful driver for you near-term in the Dental segment and how would you characterize the roll out and some of those incremental investments that need be made I guess on this front that you alluded to? Thanks. Tom Joyce : Sure, we're going to continue to invest in Spark, both in terms of the evolution of the product line as well as its commercialization. But in terms of the meaningful level of impact, it's going to be a while. Obviously, there's a geographic expansion that we will be very thoughtful about. We started in Australia and that's going exceptionally well. But we want to make sure that we are building sales organizations appropriately, training sales organizations, training our customers so that as we enter incremental geographies, we do that in a very thoughtful and ultimately very successful way. So there's a journey ahead. We think the journey is certainly a worthwhile one because we all know that the clear aligner market is an exceptional market, has great growth rate and there's tremendous opportunities there particularly with what we think is a highly competitive product and very attractive from a value creation perspective associated with our customer set. So step-by-step, I think it will become meaningful over time, but there's a road to go ahead. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our allotted time for Q&A. I'll now turn it back to Mr. Gugino for closing comments. Matt Gugino : Thanks, David. And thanks everyone for joining us today. We are around all day for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may now disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us this morning.",

During the year, strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion delivered double-digit adjusted EPS and mid-teens free cash flow growth. We delivered 6% core revenue growth for the full year, which was a meaningful step up versus prior years, led primarily by the impact of new product innovation and commercial initiatives.  The Danaher business system continued to serve as the driving force behind our execution and our ability to take share in many of our businesses. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in 2018, resulting in 16.5% growth year-on-year that helps position us for significant capital deployment going forward. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was a 127%, representing the 27 consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We deployed over $2 billion of capital during the year, including the acquisitions of IDT and Blue Software. IDT joined our life science platform adding best in class genomics consumables capabilities, and Blue Software now part of Esko enhances our offering across our packaging development and production work flow. We are excited to have both these businesses as part of Danaher.  Turning now to the fourth quarter, sales grew 5.5% to $5.4 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenue by 2%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 2%. Core revenue increased 5.5% with all five platforms delivering better than expected results. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single digits, led by double digit growth in both China and India. Across the developed markets, we saw high single digit growth in the US, while Western Europe was up low single digits. Gross margins for the fourth quarter; gross margin was 55.1%, and operating profit margin was 17.9%. Core operating margin declined 15 basis points, driven primarily by accelerated investment spend, foreign currency impact from a stronger US dollar, and tariff related costs. Full year gross margin was a record high 55.8%, and we increased our core operating margin by 70 basis points. This marks the fourth quarter consecutive year that we increased our core operating margin by 70 basis points or more. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.28, bringing full year adjusted diluted net EPS to $4.52, our fifth straight year of double digit growth.  Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue increased 10.5% and core revenue was up 7.5%. Operating profit margin declined 30 basis points to 19.7%, as a result of foreign currency impact and accelerated growth investments. For the full year, life sciences delivered an outstanding 180 basis points of core operating margin expansion, a testament to the teams\u2019 strong DBS execution.  Turning to the individual operating companies; Beckman Life Sciences achieved high single digit core revenue growth for the quarter. More than 20% growth in automation was driven by demand for new products like the Biomek i Series, Beckman sample preparation platform launched last year. We further enhanced our automation capabilities with our recent bolt-on acquisition of Labcyte Corporation. Labcyte brings complementary technology to the core Beckman offering, with an acoustic dispensing method that is used for liquid handling in life science applications. The non-contact low-volume dispensing technique eliminates cross contamination risks and greatly reduces fluid loss, helping scientists around the world to achieve better results. These organic and inorganic growth investments are helping us provide best-in-class solutions for our customers and contributing to Beckman Life Sciences above market growth rate.  Leica Microsystems\u2019 core revenue was up mid-single digits with positive performance across most major end markets and regions, led by life science research in North America. Over the last few years, the Leica team has significantly improved their cadence of innovation through the use of DBS tools. Leica introduced three times the number of new products and technologies in 2018 versus the prior year, while improving their project on time delivery by more than 2000 basis points. The combination of better R&D processes along with enhanced commercial execution have contributed to a meaningful step up in Leica\u2019s core revenue growth over the past few years.  Core revenue at SCIEX was up high single digits. Strong results in North America and China were broad based driven by demand across the clinical, food testing and forensic end markets. Phenomenex, our separations consumables business achieved high single digit core revenue growth. It\u2019s been two years since we acquired Phenomenex and the team has made tremendous progress with a number of DBS commercial initiatives including funnel management and transformative marketing. Through these and other DBS driven growth initiatives Phenomenex has increased the size of their addressable market by 30%.  At Pall, high single digit core revenue growth was driven by similar results across both our life sciences and industrial businesses. Biotech was up double-digits, led by strong performance in single use technologies where demand for new products like the iCELLis bioreactor system continues to help drive share gains. IDT delivered mid-teens revenue growth with positive performance across all major regions and product lines. The team continued to build upon early progress with DBS and the business has consistently exceeded our initial performance expectations. Moving to diagnostics, reported revenue increased 3.5% and core revenue was up 6%. For the full year, diagnostics delivered 6.5% core revenue growth, meaningful step up versus prior years driven by both organic growth investment and the continued evolution of our diagnostics portfolio. Reported operating margin declined by 70 basis points to 18.8% in the fourth quarter, however core operating margin expanded by 20 basis points.  At Beckman Diagnostics, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by China and improved results in North America. By product line, immunoassay led the way and we saw good growth in automation as well, driven by early success in Europe with our recently launched DxA 5000 automation system. In hematology, we are encouraged by early customer feedback on our new DxH 900 high volume analyzer and the DxH 520 for low to mid volume setting. These are two of the many new products that Beckman introduced this year that expanded our offering and improved our competitive position in the core lab.  At Radiometer, high single digit core revenue growth was driven by strong quarter in North America, Western Europe and China. Our blood gas and AQT product lines delivered outstanding results, and we believe Radiometer continued to take share in the acute care market. Leica Biosystems, core revenue was up mid-single digits, with broad based strength across most major regions and product lines, led by double digit growth in Advanced Staining. And at Cepheid, double digit core revenue growth was driven by North America and Western Europe. The business achieved a significant milestone in the fourth quarter, placing its 20,000 instrument globally further expanding Cepheid\u2019s market leading installed base.  Continued innovation around our test menu has also been a meaningful contributor to Cepheid\u2019s outstanding results. The team maintained their cadence of innovation with the recent CE-IVD marking of the Xpert HBV Viral Load test, a new rapid test for the quantitation of the Hepatitis B Virus that delivers results in less than an hour. With the addition of this test, Cepheid now offers a complete virology test menu suitable for any laboratory setting, making high quality testing and disease monitoring accessible to even more clinicians and patients. Turning now to our dental segment, reported revenue was flat and operating profit margin increased by 70 basis points to 13.8%. Core operating margins declined by 185 basis points, primarily as a result of ongoing investment spend focused on new product development. Dental core revenue was up 2.5%, one of our better quarters in some time. We remain encouraged by science of end market stabilization, particularly in our North American traditional consumables and equipment business where we saw another quarter of positive sell-out data.  Our dental business in China, now over 200 million in annual revenue saw a double digit growth again this quarter. Our approach as a more localized player offering a comprehensive product suite positions us well for continued growth in the region. Our specialty consumables business was up low single digits versus a tough prior year comparison with solid performance across orthodontics and implants. Growth was led by performance in high growth markets with particular strength in China and Eastern Europe.  At the Greater New York Dental Show in November, we featured a number of new technologies from across the dental platform. These included the DEXIS titanium inter-oral sensor and Nobel\u2019s X-Guide for computer guided dental implant surgery. Both important products that support the team\u2019s focus on providing customers with the best-in-class, fully integrated digital workflow.  In addition, Ormco\u2019s full-scale Clear aligner system, Spark continues to be very well received in Australia and as a reminder the team obtained FDA 510-k clearance for Spark earlier in the fourth quarter. This is obviously an important step as we continue our expansion of our Clear aligner offering.  Moving to our environmental and applied solutions segment; reported revenue was up 4.5% and core revenue increased 5%. Reported operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 22.7% with modest core margin expansion. In product identification, core revenue increased by mid-single digit rate led by demand for marketing coding equipment and related consumables.  Videojet core revenue was up high single digits, with positive performance across all major regions, end markets and product lines. The team continued to expand Videojet\u2019s powerful installed base, which now includes more than 10,000 remotely connected printers. Using data analytics, we\u2019re able to help customers run their packaging product season plants more efficiently and with fewer instances of disruptive down time.  Videojet\u2019s industry leading connectivity provides unique insights to help us serve customers more effectively and this differentiated offering is a key contributor to Videojet\u2019s above-market growth rate. 2018 marked Videojet\u2019s 9th consecutive year of mid-single digit or better core growth. Our packaging business which included Esko and X-Rite was down low-single digits, but we\u2019re encouraged by recent order trends and feel well positioned by our improved performance in 2019.  Finally, turning to water quality, core revenue growth to the platform was up mid-single digits. Core revenue increased at Hach at a high single-digit rate of momentum in both municipal and industrial end markets. Geographically, the developed markets in China led the way. For the full year 2018, Hach achieved 10% core revenue growth. The Hach team has consistently combined our expanding commercial execution with innovative new products to deliver this market-leading growth.  Hach\u2019s developed our best-in-class digital marketing platform that we\u2019ve now rolled out across our other Water Quality businesses, and the team has meaningfully expanded Hach\u2019s addressable market with new products like the CM130 chlorine analyzer for dialysis applications and the Claros Water Intelligent Software system. The team\u2019s commitment to continue its improvement has helped Hach differentiate its customer value proposition and further strengthen its competitive advantage.  At Trojan, core revenue declined due to a tough prior comp comparison, but we saw healthy levels of project bidding activity during the quarter and we\u2019re encouraged by the underlying momentum in the market. Lastly, ChemTreat\u2019s high single digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across North America and Latin America primarily in the food, chemical and oil and gas end markets. The team\u2019s commitment to commercial excellence has helped ChemTreat sustain a remarkable track record with 2018 marking their 51st consecutive year of core revenue growth.  So to wrap up, 2018 was a tremendous year for Danaher and we\u2019re well positioned as we begin 2019. Over the past several years through a combination of organic and inorganic growth initiatives, we\u2019ve transformed Danaher in to a higher growth, higher margin and higher recurring revenue company, with strong footholds in attractive, fast growing end markets. Our portfolio today combined with the power of the Danaher business system positions us well as we focus on delivering long term shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.03 which assumed core growth of approximately 4%. We continue to expect full year 2019 core revenue growth of approximately 4% and adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.85. Matt Gugino : Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Christy, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Maybe want to start on margins, obviously a lot of moving pieces here between FX, tariffs, M&A and then some of the dental investments. I know it\u2019s going to be maybe more of a backend loaded year for margin expansion this year, can you maybe just talk about when some of these acquisitions may turn margin accretive? And then can you also comment on your diagnostic margins, looked like they contracted quite a bit, can you maybe just touch on that as well? Tom Joyce : Sure Tycho. Obviously we did a few things here in the fourth quarter to take advantage of what we saw was a pretty strong quarter evolving particularly in the latter month of December, and so we did accelerate some investment, some spend in a couple of areas that impacted both the cost of good sales line and SG&A. We accelerated some investment in life science in particular and in R&D and sales and marketing and also did a few things accelerating some cost actions in diagnostics and make some investments in new products around dental. So I think a few things that really made some good sense there and to your point clearly FX and tariffs were headwinds in the quarter and made a difference.  I think if you put those aside, overall margins would have been up roughly about 50 basis points were it not for the FX and tariff impact. So we do see margins continue to improve during the course of the year. Obviously we\u2019ve got a terrific track record here. In terms of acquisition related impact on the margins, IDT turns core here in April, so we\u2019ll start to see those starts to move through. It will take a little bit of a while here before we see the impact of Labcyte obviously our newer acquisition, but IDT obviously will be a much more material contribution. So we\u2019ll see that starting in April which will be a help.  On the DX side, as I mentioned, we did accelerate some cost actions and some investment there. We got a terrific line-up of new products that are coming through and so continuing to invest in our automation product, hematology, some new products that are coming a little bit out in the future around immunoassay and clinical chemistry, I think are certainly also are having an impact there, but we think those investments make tremendous sense.  Obviously we had a bit of a comp there with Cepheid coming off with a fourth quarter in 2017 where Cepheid\u2019s top line was up north of 25% a year ago and was up low double digits in the fourth quarter here. So a little bit less \u2013 a little bit of a tough comp there that had some impact on margin, but again specific to DX just coming back very briefly to FX and tariffs, if you put those aside, DX would have been up about 50 basis points in the quarter. Matt McGrew : And Tycho maybe just kind of a more color. If you think about the first half headwind that we\u2019ve got in FX, we\u2019re going to see the margin ramp throughout the year. Q1 we\u2019re going to have, of the 400 million of revenue headwind, 200 is going to be in Q1, that\u2019s probably going to be $0.05 or $0.06 of EPS hit in Q1. So if we wouldn\u2019t have had that in Q1 I think we\u2019ve probably would have seen more like double-digit EPS growth at the high end, and the FX impact here in the first half is going to be greater than it will be in the second half heading into \u201919. Tycho Peterson : That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on dental, obviously nice recovery there, how much of this you think is kind of broader end market strength versus some of that Danaher-specific factors like the Nobel China strength, and any thing we should be thinking about in terms of Clear Aligner launch in the US in terms of revenue contribution for this year? Tom Joyce : Sure. Well clearly we\u2019ve seen some stabilization in the end market as I commented in my remarks. And that really is coming in the form of improved sell-out in North America, and specifically in the areas that were more challenged in the past several months in quarters which was on a traditional equipment and consumable side. So end market stabilization definitely a contributor, but our execution continues to improve as well, and a number of the steps that we\u2019ve taken over the last several quarters and that has continued to enhance the way we\u2019re executing in that market. From a Clear Aligner perspective, again things are going extremely well in Australia. But we\u2019re trying to take a very thoughtful approach to the way we expand our geographic footprint, making sure that we are cultivating the right customer target as we did in Australia, the digitally savvy end customer dentist and orthodontist, who has historically taken advantage of our insignia product line as an example. And so as we think about geographic expansion, we\u2019ll be thoughtful about where those markets are well set up from our standpoint for commercial execution and obviously we\u2019re in the process of ramping our own capacity and so that will be an impact as well. I would not expect that we would be talking to material contributions to the dental platform for growth rate this year, but perhaps as we go in to next year we\u2019ll start to be looking at some numbers that are starting to make a difference. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Muken of Evercore. Ross Muken : So it seems like you had sort of better execution in Beckman this quarter. You know the business has been doing reasonably well relative to your peers. You\u2019re a little underweight in immunoassay. It seems like that had a quite a good quarter. Just give me a little bit of a feel for the execution at Beck and how you feel about sort of that growth step off in to next year, given maybe some of the things you\u2019ve also done in the portfolio there? Tom Joyce : Ross, the fourth quarter was clearly one of Beckman Diagnostics\u2019 better quarters in some time. And that really comes to or is driven by improved commercial execution in a number of regions and new product innovations starting to drive some impact. And we saw mid-single digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That was really led by immunoassay and automation and those are obviously key drivers here. 2018 is the first time that our immunoassay business has tipped over and become a bit larger than our clinical chemistry business.  So you see the impact of our commercial execution there and some of the automation related competitive advantages we have that are driving that immunoassay growth rate, and that growth rate has been very consistent in most cases with our competitive set. And so now we\u2019re mixing upward our core revenue growth by virtue of that performance. North America in particular saw some improvement in growth rates and obviously that\u2019s a key battleground for us, and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in our competitive win rates and our customer retention rates.  So, I think a meaningful step up here in to the 3%ish kind of growth rate and what we\u2019re looking for is kind of another 40 to 50 basis points of step up going forward, and I think what we\u2019ve seen historically over the last couple of years is that very thing. Automation is going well as I mentioned in my remarks, hematology, you know that\u2019s been kind of a drag for us. We\u2019re seeing a much more competitive product line because of both the high volume and the low and mid volume offerings now. And I think with what\u2019s coming around low and mid volume immunoassay and clinical chemistry as well as some of what we\u2019re doing in terms of menu gaps that we\u2019ll start to see continued or we will see continued performance improvement there. I think one thing to keep in mind is we \u2013 I know we often talk about Beckman its obviously the biggest business in our diagnostic portfolio, but it\u2019s also important to remember the DX platform grew 6.5% in 2018 and so as we do the comparisons appropriately to broad based competitors in the market, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about how the portfolio is stacking up right now. Ross Muken : That\u2019s helpful Tom. And may be just \u2013 I feel like you guys have consistently highlighted given where the balance sheet is now and how strong the cash flow is, sort of the M&A fire power opportunity. Obviously though it\u2019s sort of been a choppy or a volatile public equity market which sometimes will make transactions more complicated. But I guess how are you thinking about sort of your ability to execute on something at least more sizeable in the current environment and how are you thinking about valuations as you look at them broadly and whether or not you\u2019ve seen sort of sellers given some of this volatility get a bit more sensible around potential prices? Tom Joyce : Sure. Well in terms of our ability to execute and we talked about this a fair amount when we were all together in December. We feel terrific about where we are. Some really good acquisitions this year obviously $2 billion or better executed this past year, IDT and Blue and a few other smaller deals are terrific additions to our portfolio. But the balance sheet today it\u2019s in as good a position as almost we have ever been. If you think about our leverage ratio today, we\u2019re talking about being about two in terms of net debt-to-EBITDA, that\u2019s the lowest level since pre-Pall and so in terms of our capacity, our ability to execute both from a balance sheet perspective, and of course also from a talent perspective we feel very good about where we are.  In terms of the valuation in the market today, we all know that M&A can be episodic, we are nothing if not patient about looking for and cultivating the most strategic and financially attractive deals.  But the pipeline is good today, our cultivation levels are as good as ever, you\u2019ve heard us talk about the breadth of that cultivation which is across all the platforms probably with a little bit less emphasis as you might imagine right now in terms of large capital deployment, a little bit less emphasis perhaps on doing that in dental, but certainly the other four platforms are off the front line and with the capacity we have, and the ability to deploy a significant amount of capital this year, we\u2019re hoping that things break our way.  In terms of sensibility of valuations well of course the sellers have always think their valuations are sensible. This volatility helps clearly, I think the shake up in the latter part of last year may have gotten some folks thinking about what they might do, but things have sort of stabilized here. So it\u2019s early, a little tough to tell, but we\u2019re in great shape and are prepared to do things of consequence. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Overall a really strong quarter, I would love to have a little bit color around what you\u2019re seeing out of China, just given the variability of results that we\u2019ve seen across the board from both cyclical and non-cyclical companies have had a range of outcomes that are pretty broad, but what are you guys seeing in China, what are your local guys telling and what kind of confidence do you have in 2019 in the region? Tom Joyce : Sure. Scott I know there\u2019s a lot of interest in China right now, there\u2019s been a lot written about what appears factually based to be a slow-down in the broad redefined Chinese market. We are not seeing anything specific that we could point to today that is impacting our businesses in China. I think you can start with the fact that we\u2019re really well positioned to cross our core market. Diagnostics, life sciences, water quality, product identification, consumer, packaged goods and of course dental, which as you heard again growing double digits, are great markets to be in. So, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s what you\u2019re reading about today which appears to be more of a consumer-driven slow-down in the Chinese market would be as obviously in our businesses.  Our business in China was up double-digit in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s the 8th consecutive quarter or better said the second straight year of double digit growth for us in China. And that was pretty broad based, pretty much across the board; we can\u2019t really point to any particular slow-downs. Over the past three to four years, our China growth has been up high single digits, low single digit. So could we start to see a little bit of an impact there? I think we could. I think these consumer driven impacts can start to move across in to even in the industrial markets psychologies. And while we have a very little industrial exposure left broadly defined at Danaher, whether that\u2019s a Pall Industrial or Hach Industrial or PID Industrial, probably less than 10% of Danaher today and therefore at even a smaller portion of our China business. Those are the things we\u2019ll watch carefully as indicators as to whether or not we\u2019re seeing a broader slowdown. Scott Davis : And just a little bit of a nuance question here, but when I see companies take a step up in investments, discretionary investments, always begs a question of are you catching upon spend or you\u2019re getting ahead of spend. And obviously the nuance there being, if you\u2019re catching up, its\u2019 more of a new normal, if you\u2019re getting ahead its more pulled forward. So do you have a comment on that? Tom Joyce : Sure. It\u2019s an interesting question Scott, because I think it\u2019s probably \u2013 I think if you look across how broad our portfolio is in a number of operating companies, I\u2019m sure we could find examples of both. But I think largely we try to get ahead. We try to look for those things where based on what we were anticipating in the quarter, we thought we might now have room for and some things where we can use some good discretion about investments that would have some impact on a relatively near term basis. And so clearly I think there could always be a mix there, but the strategic intent is to look for those things that we knew were right to do, were anticipating that we would do at some point and we wanted to get ahead to try to continue to enhance the growth trajectory of the business. Operator : Your next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin : Couple of questions, first one is any pull forwards budget flushing that \u2013 given the tariff issues and just concerned on spending and just net of anything different about spending trends in the quarter? Tom Joyce : Not that we can see Derik. The order rates looked pretty solid. We said when we spoke in December; we said we had a pretty October and November. That remained consistent in December, and I think in general our businesses are probably a little bit less exposed if you will to budget flush, pull forward, given the 70% recurring revenue which is obviously largely made up of consumables and in some part service. But when 70% of your revenue is driven by that recurring revenue, you\u2019re a bit left whether it\u2019s exposed or vulnerable or however you might want to describe it to a bunch of flush or a pull forward at year end.  So I\u2019m sure there could be a couple of circumstances whether it\u2019s a high-end Leica microscope or a couple of things that Beck has left where somebody might do that. But in terms of materially of it, it doesn\u2019t appear that that had much impact. In terms of tariff, I\u2019m not sure that it had much impact at least as we look at our China numbers throughout the course of the quarter. We\u2019re not a significant target, but right now I wouldn\u2019t say in the cross-hairs, at least if you measured that by virtue of the financial impact. We\u2019ve talked already to about $12 million to $13 million of impact per quarter or about $50 million annually with about $30 million of incremental impact in 2019 versus \u201918. So, we\u2019re doing some things obviously to try to offset that. But in terms of the impact of that dynamic on orders or pull-forwards, again limited exposure probably to some extent a limited level of even the awareness level at the China end market level. So, nothing to point to specifically at the moment in terms of the impact and orders of volume. Derik De Bruin : And just a follow-up question, have you made any decisions in terms of how much debt you\u2019re going to put on the dental spend, and just a question of sort of like at the time of the spend what\u2019s the RemainCo leverage ratio is going to be? Tom Joyce : I would say, what we do with Beck with forward there\u2019s probably a good proxy here. Our intention is to launch the dental business with a strong balance sheet with an investment grade rating and ability to use their free cash flow to add incrementally to their portfolio through some inorganic moves, some M&A moves. So, I think our history is probably a good proxy for what we would do going forward. And I think we would do that in a way that also leaves us in perfect shape from a RemainCo perspective. Obviously we start with a great position here in the beginning of 2019. It\u2019s hard to imagine being in a better shape, but I don\u2019t think that dental given it\u2019s a scale will ultimately impact us in terms of RemainCo being set up to win from a capital deployment perspective. Matt McGrew : Derik may be the simple way to think about it is. We\u2019re at two times, two turns today. If we did the spin today we\u2019d likely do dental at two-turns. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : Actually maybe we\u2019ll just jump off from the conversation there about dental and the spend which is to a couple of more questions around the assumption there. I guess first off any change to the thought process on timing. I think we all remember before that you guys were able to execute a little faster than initially planned. And as you think about the plan for dental for this year, did you anticipate any impact channel inventory fluctuations, and then maybe last around dental is, as you think about the trajectory of margins there, you clearly put a lot of capital to work driving accelerated commercial investments. How do you think about that line in \u201919? Tom Joyce : Talk first about the spend; we\u2019ve said all along we expected it to be in the second half of this year. That is still our expectation right now. I think about it at the [inaudible] and I would probably say it\u2019s \u2013 we did four to kind of right at the mid-point. I think dental is more or like probably, I would call it mid-to-late in the second half. You know as we said when we announced, we want to continue to see this market stability. We are encouraged by the fourth quarter performance clearly and deposit sell-out data, but I\u2019d like to see a bit more of that.  And we need to obviously make absolutely certain that the business is ready to stand up on its own and continue to make good progress, and so we\u2019re encouraged by all of that and that\u2019s out just in the last two quarters, we\u2019re really going to have that for much longer than that so we\u2019re making good progress.  One thing that\u2019s clearly on our mind and you guys have all read about it is, the federal government in Washington has reopened, but the shutdown certainly help our timing for IPOs and spends. You probably read in the news the backlog in SEC filings and text ruling and so on so forth are likely going to create some delays. So I think if you put all those things together we\u2019ll continue to make progress. But we need to be aware of some of those factors.  In terms of the channel inventories and your question about that and being influx, we worked really hard over the last couple of years to ensure that we built sustainable processes in partnership with our channel customers, our channel partners to ensure that we have great visibility and transparency around those channel inventories. We talked a lot about that over the last couple of years and have been key to ensuring that we have those channel inventories in good shape for all of our benefit, for both the benefit of our customers as well as ourselves is to make sure that we good transparency and visibility. And I think we\u2019ve established that and a good dialog month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter with our channel partners. So, I feel good about the stability of those. There is obviously always some variability with sell-out at category-by-category, but as a general rule I think our processes are much better as are the processes in the channel. Finally in terms of margins and commercial execution, again we\u2019ve done a number of things here that we feel good about in terms of driving performance. First of all the cost structure is in much better shape that it was three to four years ago. You\u2019ve heard me talk about consolidating from 10 up close to 3 and probably now north of 30% reduction in manufacturing and back office facility. So the cost structure is in better shape, but we\u2019re continuing to invest significantly in new product innovation. That will normalize a bit as we go forward, and I think you combine that with the impact in terms of continued topline improvements and that leads us to really continuing to be very positive about our long term growth and margin opportunities and the platform.  So, I think we expect to see some modest growth and core OMX here in the first quarter. But we also expect that to continue to improve throughout the course of the year. Steve Beuchaw : Got it, really helpful, and then just one quick follow-up. You\u2019ve flanged a couple of times and it\u2019s very true that the business has transformed significantly over the last couple of years, faster growth, some changes inorganically that have been really helpful. And so I have imagine if you feel maybe better now than you did even a couple of years ago about your ability to drive growth for target investments.  When you think about 2019, maybe we\u2019ll set aside the inorganic, but think about where you can drive organic investments, and what are your top priorities? And then I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Tom Joyce : I think we\u2019ve got a number of priorities, but clearly they would be consistent with where we\u2019ve invested really over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve invested significantly in our diagnostic platform organically. I\u2019ve talked about new products that are now having an impact at places like Beckman Diagnostics. We continue the investment rates at Cepheid sustaining those double digit growth rate both in terms of investments and instrumentation, the evolution of the architecture as well as the expansion of the menu.  In life science as well, we continue to make investments; a number of organic investments, but of course inorganic has played a key role there. And obviously with a back on those investment businesses like Pall that have helped to transform the platform, but even as recently as this past year, with the additions of IDT and LabSite, those inorganic moves are not to be overlooked in terms of their impact on improving the growth rates.  But water quality and PID are making investments as well. Those new CIJ printers at Videojet that are helping us to drive connectivity and enhancing our service offering to customers is having an impact on sustaining that growth rate at PID and Videojet specifically, and water quality investing in things like the CM130, opening up a whole new market like dialysis testing where water plays a critical role, those are having an impact.  Now the investment may not be as material there as what might go on say at a new platform at Beckman, but before it has an impact when we roll those things out to the market. So, it\u2019s broad-based but I think within a given platform for an operating company it\u2019s very specific relative to new product innovations that we think can have a material impact on growth rates. Operator : Your next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Welcome to Matt in your new role. Just a first question around environmental and applied, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been touched on yet. Wondered if you could give any update on how you\u2019re seeing all that happens that, particularly in some of the more industrial weighted businesses and also flipping over to Pall, what are your expectations for the microelectronics unit there given the CapEx seems to be coming down? Tom Joyce : Sure. So let\u2019s start with environmental and applied, just broadly, a very good quarter, really driven by a consistent performance in PID and terrific performance across water quality and specifically at Hach. I think those businesses are tracking quite well. They are to your question, each of those businesses, including Pall; represent some of the limited industrial exposure that we have. I mentioned to Scott on earlier question that we\u2019re not necessarily a terrific proxy in terms of the industrial side with about probably less than 10% of the portfolio being at Pall Industrial and Hach Industrial and PID Industrial. And so our sense is, we could see some moderation there in 2019, but in general the underlying trends remain pretty solid.  So, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re necessarily making any kind of macro call here. But given where we are in the cycle, it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of that we\u2019d see those limited pockets of industrial exposure perhaps soften up a little bit. You know so far so good, Pall Industrial, for example, fourth quarter we\u2019re up high single digits and orders were in a similar range two years stack. Hach Industrial pretty good number, PID numbers, pretty solid. So we\u2019ll continue to watch that carefully.  Specific to your question about Pall and the microelectronics market, that has been a phenomenal market for Pall over the last few years since we\u2019ve been in the business, and so I think it still is pretty solid today as we look at those growth rate, but again I do not think it would be unusual given some of what we\u2019re read about in terms of the let\u2019s just call it the consumer electronics market and similarly what you\u2019ve read about some of the impacts in China to see a little bit of a moderation there.  It\u2019s been tremendous so far, but we\u2019re not ignorant of the headlines. Matt McGrew : And that\u2019s also a business Julian. That micro-e business is a business; it\u2019s got a lot less consumables that some of our businesses kind of giving it a little bit more of that cyclicality as well. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question is around margins, one with the \u2013 kind of a follow-up on the dental question and that should we expect the step up in investment to step back down materially once the spin happens. So you will see in the first 12 months of dental as a standalone company, maybe a decent margin tailwind from that? And then some wide, if we think about the core margins, as you said they were down slightly in Q4, do we expect those to rebound in the first quarter, maybe some of our investment spend firm wise cools off. Tom Joyce : Well on the dental question, you think that there would be a combination of factors that would impact continued improvement in what you see in dental margins. Some of that would be some moderation in the investment spend around new products, because again as I mentioned, we try to be very focused on continuing to set that business up to grow, not only in terms of the investments we\u2019ve made in our digital platforms because of the importance of digital dentistry going forward, but certainly the investments that we\u2019re making in the Clear Aligner business. So, some of those may moderate slightly. In the cases of Clear Aligners those actually would probably be sustained. So a bit of a mix there. But again I think in general, in terms of the value creation opportunities of the dental platform, continued improvement in growth and profitability we feel good about those trajectories.  And then in terms of core margins more broadly, I think there\u2019s an impact here as Matt mentioned earlier around FX and tariffs here in the first quarter. As Matt mentioned probably $0.05 to $0.06, and so those will tail walk, we\u2019ll see better margin performance the deeper we get in to the year, but we\u2019d start out in the most challenging part of the calendar for certain. Operator : Your next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Doug Schenkel : So first a question on growth investments and gross margin, when I think of opportunistic growth investments and the impact on the income statement, I typically look to the R&D and SG&A lines. That said, it looks like there was some impact at the Cogs line this quarter. Is that right and if so can you provide a little bit of detail on what you did and what you expect the returns to be this year? I\u2019m at a high level trying to get a handle on how gross margin was impacted by these investments versus things like FX and tariffs. So that\u2019s another component of the question as well. Matt McGrew : Sure Doug. So I think some of the things that we kind of have done is when you think about some kind of cost pull-forwards if you will, specifically around maybe some supply chain related things etcetera like that. I think we saw some of that probably most pronounced in diagnostics, specifically at Beckman Diagnostics. And then also if you think about some of the new product ramps, kind of capacity if you will with Spark at dental and some of our other new product accelerations where you kind of building up for that first time to the degree that we\u2019re able to kind of pull some of that forward here from 2019 and get some of that worked out a little bit earlier to kind of have a more impactful launch and timing some of that with the sales and marketing as well. So you\u2019re kind of holistically planning to pull forward and get a launch out a little quicker. So I think you\u2019ll see a little bit of both that R&D, sales and marketing and those items that impact cost. Tom Joyce : I think Doug also, its\u2019 important to think about the situation in the fourth quarter, where again as the quarter progressed we\u2019re seeing the continued good performance on the topline and so we look broadly where there are those opportunities to take advantage of growth investments, and that is one of those fortunate circumstances, it doesn\u2019t happen every quarter obviously, but you look to take advantage of those things because it benefits you both on the short term and in the long term basis and we are clearly not holding back. Doug Schenkel : That\u2019s super helpful, and then just a couple of small, unimportant, quick follow-up sun shine. I know that this may not apply to you as much as some other folks, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve had any success passing along price the offset tariffs in China, and then at a higher level I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d be willing to share what the growth rate for China is that you\u2019ve embedded in to 2019 guidance? Tom Joyce : I would say price broadly defined is achieved across our portfolio largely on the consumables side. It\u2019s a little bit more challenging given the competitive sets in our businesses on the equipment side. So we generally get it on consumables and that\u2019s both true probably broadly and in China. I would not necessarily associate what we\u2019re getting in terms of price which has been very consistent with inability to have us on specific to the tariffs. The tariffs obviously are coming in other commodities than that which impacts our consumables business. So we\u2019re certainly not having a specific conversation with customers about that. But our in general we\u2019re trying to get price on a global basis, and in general we\u2019re on the consumable side.  And then in terms of growth rates, you\u2019ve heard me mention already today about the consistency of our performance in China in terms of what our expectations are for this year. We embedded an assumption that China would continue to be a high single digit kind of growth rate and could very well be right up there at double-digit growth rate, but I think high single is probably the right way to think about it. Operator : Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks Christy, and thanks everyone for joining us. We\u2019re around for questions all day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2019 delivering first quarter results ahead of our expectations. We achieved 5.5% core revenue growth, and believe we expanded our market leading positions at a number of our operating companies through a combination of new product innovation and strong commercial execution. Our growth was broad-based with all four segments delivering better than expected results, and we continue to see healthy conditions across our major end markets. Combined with solid adjusted EPS growth and free cash flow generation, our performance is a testament to the power of the Danaher business system. Our team's focus execution is continued to accelerate our growth trajectory and drive long-term value creation. And we're excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. Over the past few years, you've heard us talk a lot about building a better, stronger Danaher. An important and transformational component in that pursuit is our pending acquisition of the GE Biopharma business, which we announced on February 25th. GE Biopharma is a leading global player in the attractive biologics production market and will bring complementary strengths to our life sciences platform across the bio processing workflow. We expect this acquisition will be accretive to Danaher on multiple levels, and will further advance our evolution into a higher growth innovation-driven company. We could not be more excited about this business, the team and what they'll bring to Danaher. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals. And we're making good progress towards closing, which we continue to be -- which continues to be on track for the fourth quarter of this year. Turning to our first quarter results. Sales grew 4% to $4.9 billion, driven by 5.5% core growth. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%, while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 4%. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single-digits led by double-digit growth in China. Across the developed markets, we saw mid single-digit growth in the U.S. and low single-digit growth in Western Europe. Gross margin for the first quarter was 55.7%, and operating profit margin was 14.8%. Core operating margin increased 40 basis points despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar year-on-year. Excluding this foreign currency impact, core operating margin would have been up 90 basis points. First quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.07 representing 8% growth year-on-year Now let's take a more detailed look at our first quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue was up 10% and core revenue grew 7%. Reported operating profit margin was up 60 basis points to 19% with core margins increasing by 100 basis points. Segment life sciences core revenue was up double digits making this the business' seventh consecutive quarter of high single-digit or better core revenue growth. Broad based strength across most major regions and product lines was led by double-digit growth in flow cytometry and sanctification. Ad we believe the team's combination of high quality innovation plus commercial execution continue to drive market share gains across the business. Leica Microsystems achieved high single-digit core revenue growth. Strength across North America and China was driven by demand in life science research as we continue to benefit from new product introductions. Most recently Leica launched the THUNDER Imaging Systems, a new class of wide field instruments designed specifically for high speed, high quality imaging of 3D biology. Scientists used this imaging technology to study organisms, tissue sections and advanced cell cultures for use in microbiology, neuroscience and cancer research. Core revenue at SCIEX was up low single digits with good performance in pharmaceutical, academic and applied markets, partially offset by the impact of a tough comparison in our North American clinical business, which was up meaningfully last year. Pall's core revenue increased at a high single-digit rate with growth across all major geographies. Pall Industrial was up mid single-digits led by aerospace and process and industrial, and we continue to see solid order trends within both businesses. Double digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences was driven by our biotech business, particularly single use technologies where we're seeing robust demand for our iCELLis bioreactor system in gene therapy applications. The iCELLis provided excellent cell growth conditions for adherent cells, which are used to produce gene therapies. And it is the most widely used cell adherent bioreactor on the market today. iCELLis was recently highlighted at the Interphex Bioproduction Trade Show along with the number of Pall's other market leading bioprocessing innovations. Moving to diagnostics. Reported revenue grew 1% with core revenue growth of 5%. Reported operating margin decreased to 15.2% with both core and reported margins down 110 basis points. This decline is predominantly attributable to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. At Beckman Diagnostics, core revenue was up mid single-digits, as we saw continued improvement in North America and double-digit growth in China. By product line, immunoassay and automation led the way. And in hematology, we're seeing early sign of the positive impact from our new product introductions, including the DxH 520 and DxH 900 analyzers for low to high volume settings. Beckman recently received 510K clearance from the U.S. FDA for the DxH 520 and for the Early Sepsis Indicator to be run on the DxH 900. These additions in hematology are key examples how we're enhancing our competitive position and accelerating our growth trajectory assessments. Radiometer delivered high single-digit core revenue growth led by performance in China. And we believe this team continued to gain market share in North America. During the quarter, Radiometer expanded their install base globally across both our blood gas and AQT product lines. We acquired Radiometer in early 2004. And the first quarter marked their 15th anniversary as part of Danaher. During that time, the team has become a champion of DBS helping to evolve the tools and processes that are shared across Danaher today. As a result of this strong DBS execution and leadership, Radiometer has achieved tremendous results, including more than 1,000 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. And over the last five years, the business has averaged high single-digit core revenue growth compared to low single-digit growth at the time of acquisition. As one of our longest tenured operating companies today, Radiometer provides a terrific example of the long-term power of DBS. Through a balanced approach, implementing growth, lean and leadership tools, Radiometer has established a market leading position that it continues to enhance today. Leica Biosystems also had an excellent start to the year with core revenue up high single-digits led by Advanced Staining and core histology across the developed markets and in China. At Cepheid, core growth was down slightly against the prior year comparison of over 40% growth, which is primarily driven by last year's severe flu season. The team continued to expand Cepheid's market leading installed base, and is gaining momentum in North America with Integrated Delivery Networks or IDNs. Cepheid cartridge based molecular test is a uniquely well suited solution for IDN and their patients as it ensures consistent results across the network, whether the test is done in a large hospital lab or in a physician's office. Turning now to our Dental segment, reported revenue declined 2%, while core revenue grew 2.5%. Reported operating profit margins declined to 7.3% with both core and reported margins down 30 basis points. This decline primarily reflects the impact of ongoing investment spend focused on new product development. We saw growth across our specialty and traditional product lines. And we remain encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in the North American end markets. High growth markets led the way geographically with China up double-digits. The Dental team continues to pursue one of its key strategic priorities. That is accelerating growth through innovation. At two recent industry trade shows IDS and Chicago Midwinter, we featured more than 20 new products and technologies from across the Dental platform, really the culmination of strategic investments in R&D and sales and marketing over the last few years. At Nobel, Xeal and TiUltra are new implant surface technologies that enable better bone and tissue integration, while improving aesthetic results. And the KaVo OP 3D is a scalable modular imaging system that provides clinicians with the flexibility to upgrade to the latest 3D imaging technology as they expand their capabilities and grow their practices. So we're excited about the cadence of new production introductions, and believe that with expanding portfolio solutions we\u2019ll further distinguish our Dental business going forward. We're also making good progress as we work to establish the platform as a separate publicly traded company in the second half of this year. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions Segment. Reported revenue increased 3% and core revenue was up 5.5%. Reported operating margin increased 110 basis points to 23.2% with 140 basis points of core margin expansion due to outstanding execution across the segment. In product identification, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. Videojet core revenue was up mid single-digits led by results in the developed markets. Growth was broad-based across all major product lines with good traction for newly introduced products like the remotely connected CIJ 1580 industrial inkjet printer. Using DDS growth and innovation tools, Videojet has continuously expanded its product portfolio and getting higher impact products to market faster. This growing innovation execution differentiates Videojet's customer solutions and is a key driver of the team's consistent market outperformance. Core revenue in our packaging business, which includes Esko and X-Rite was flat, but recent order trends are improving, and we expect better performance as we move through the year. Finally, turning to water quality, core revenue growth for the platform was up high single-digits. Hach core revenue increased at a mid single-digit rates as end market demand remained healthy. Europe and China led the way. And we continue to see solid order trends across both municipal and industrial applications globally. Hach is consistently growing above the market over the last several years, in part driven by best-in-class commercial execution. The team has aligned their go-to-market strategy to better meet customers' needs. And a great example of this is the expansion of Hach's e-commerce platform. The team's double-digit e-commerce revenue growth in the quarter is a testament to how our innovative commercial strategy is delivering even greater value to customers. At Trojan, core revenue increased by more than 20% as a result of a few large municipal projects in North America and in China. The team sustained a solid customer win rates and continues to benefit from recent new product introductions like UVSigma and UVFlex. Lastly, ChemTreat delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth with the team's sales execution driving strong performance in North America by end market, chemicals, metal processing and oil and gas led the way.  So, to wrap up, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, and look forward to building on this momentum as we move through the year. Our team's commitment to continuous improvement helped us achieve our sixth consecutive quarter of 5.5% or better core revenue growth, high single-digit adjusted EPS growth and solid operating margin expansion. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.13 and $1.16, which assumes core growth of approximately 4% to 5%. We now expect full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.80, which reflects the dilutive impacts of our recent equity offerings, partially offset by our first quarter performance. Looking ahead, 2019 will be a transformational year for Danaher. We will be welcoming the GE Biopharma business to our Life Sciences platform and are establishing our Dental platform as a separate publicly traded company. These are incredibly important portfolio moves that we expect will maximize value for our shareholders, customers and associates, and help all of us realize greater potential. With DBS as our foundation, we're well positioned to continue building on our growth trajectory and are excited about the opportunities to come. Matt Gugino : Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Laurie, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Want to start with China. You guys continue to put up really good numbers there. We've had some interesting data points slightly. One of your peers talked about destocking on the diagnostic side yesterday. And then, there's been more noise on the crackdown on generics kind of impacting the pharma market. So can you maybe just looking ahead talk a little bit about how your expectations for China have evolved? And are you seeing any headwinds from either of the dynamics? Tom Joyce : Tycho, we actually feel really good about where we are in China right now, double-digit growth across the businesses, this by the way with the ninth consecutive quarter. And I think what's most encouraging in this the growth that we're seeing is broad based. All four of our segments were up double-digits in the first quarter. So whether you look at Diagnostics or Life Sciences, the Dental platform, certainly water quality everybody, I think doing a nice job by driving the four segments to double-digits in the quarter. I think, if we look at anything where there might be a little bit of slowness, I think I'd probably point to PID, Product ID over the past couple of quarters, but not in the sense of a meaningful step down. And of course, PID is only about roughly 5% of our China revenues. So we feel very good about how we're positioned. And these end markets, as you know well, are our terrific end markets to be in China. So over the span of time three to -- last three to four years, we've been high single-digits to low double-digit kind of across the board. Could we see a little bit of softness in the second half? I think that would only be a function right now related to the comps that we have, particularly in water. I think Q -- middle of the year to back end of the year, our water business was up greater than 25%. So I think that will be a tough comp. But in terms of the fundamentals, in China right now, and I -- by the way, Tycho, I was just there. I was there two weeks ago and met really one of our teams, spent some time with customers, talking with our -- certainly DS customers in the hospital market as well as in bioprocessing. And that the tone was really quite good. So I think we feel good about the markets. We feel good about our position in those markets. You asked about generics. We understand there is some policy moves uplift there. That has -- can have impact on pricing, at the same time we may have an impact on access and volumes. And generally we benefit from expanding access and volumes. But we're not that dynamic that we're really in the crosshairs of. We would be a second or third derivative of how we might actually benefit from expansion of generics in that market. So those will be our thoughts. Matt McGrew : Yes. And Tycho, besides your earlier question on the diagnostics, we clearly are not seeing bad dynamic from the destocking perspective either. Tycho Peterson : And then on Beckman, you're continuing to put up great numbers there. Obviously, you've had a couple of competitive launches. One of your peers talked about, I think two thirds of competitive accounts in Europe at this point. Maybe you just talk about your confidence in holding share. I know you're going to have a product refresh at some point. But just talk a little bit about chemistry and immunoassay and your ability to hold shares there. And then any metrics you can put on customer retention rates with the new hematology systems and now your confidence in that driving growth? Tom Joyce : Sure Tycho. We continue to have an ever improving cadence of new product introductions at Beckman. Hematology is going to a big step forward in that. It's been one of the areas that where we've had a challenge over years since we acquired the business. But we think we've stabilized that and really around the cusp of starting to improve our position there on a more material basis. If we look at what the flow of new products that are coming on the core clinical chemistry and immunoassay side, we feel very good about those products, particularly how they will enhance our competitiveness in low and mid-volumes environment, and we'll see those really over the next year to two years. Those will also come with enhanced menus as there have been a couple of menu gaps over time. Those are new products. Those new architectures will also bring along enhanced menus that will improve our competitiveness. So we feel very good about that. We've always led the way in larger volume environments, particularly with automation. We've even stepped up our automation gain recently with the introduction of the DxH line of automation equipment. And so, I think the combination of the products that have just come to the market more recently, the recent FDA approval, also our clearances, and those that are coming over the next year to two years, I think we feel very good about improving the trajectory of Beckman from a core growth perspective. And you see that in the numbers this quarter, saw the numbers last quarter. If you look at the overall diagnostic platform of which Beckman obviously is a big part, now putting up 6% core growth in the past. And in that 5% to 6% range now with little bit more consistency, we feel very good about that. And of course, that was against the very tough comp of a quarter ago. Relative to metrics that we track, we do track retention and win rates very carefully across our businesses, Beckman included. We don't publish those numbers. But I can tell you that we look at those numbers consistently every month and we see a continuing improving trend and have for some time now in both retention and win rates. Tycho Peterson : One very quick one from a group before I hop off my comments to. So I would ask on GE Biopharma. How much actual free cash flow is this business generating? Matt McGrew : They're generating about $1 billion or so. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Just one quick question. Did you see any sort of impact at all in the U.S. from the government shutdown earlier in the year? Tom Joyce : No. Well, we saw it in traffic, I mean, in Washington, out my window in Pennsylvania Avenue. Everybody loves being able to get to work a lot faster. But in all seriousness, no, we can't point to anything in the shutdown. That would be of any consequence at all. Of course, we don't -- we have -- to say almost zero. I tell you that almost zero revenue that actually is directly attached to federal government activity. At most we are linked to funding that comes from the federal government to NIH, and then out from NIH into the broader Life Science market. But in terms of any direct linkage to federal government spending, I would say, I would say none at all. Derik De Bruin : So can you elaborate a little bit more on the diagnostics operating margin? I mean your -- all your businesses have essentially the same -- essentially, the same FX. So what was it about -- what is it about your diagnostic mix that took the corporative margin down in this quarter from FX whereas the other segments and you saw good expansion in EAS and good expansion in the life sciences? Tom Joyce : Yes. Well, there's a couple of factors going on there. You have, first of all, the FX and tariffs together. And so when you take those kind of things, you'd -- FX and tariffs alone would bring those otherwise negative OMX numbers up to, probably flat or maybe even a hair above that. And then there's a little bit of a mix component that was going on there. Obviously, Cepheid's operating leverage that we had last year coming off of greater than 40% core growth. And then add to that, Beckman DX improving the mid single-digits at somewhat lower margins, obviously, you get the combination of those two factors Cepheid against Beck DX. And then some targeted investment spend, no question we continue to ramp up our new product spending at Beck Dx, as well as Cepheid. So I think it's a really a combination of those things. But as we look forward, those, certainly, the FX and tariff headwinds will continue a little bit in Q2, but as you look into the second half of the year, we'll see better OMX in the second half, for sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Ross Muken : So maybe on the biopharma side, and it feels like across number of parts of the business that end market customer vertical remains quite robust. It seem like Pall had quite good growth in the quarter on what's, I think, increasingly tough comp, so strong underlying. I guess, how are you thinking about sort of that end market broadly? And then, in terms of Pall, specifically, in terms of sustaining kind of the elevated growth we've seen, you feel like, you've got pretty good visibility on that remaining kind of these kind of high single-digit, low double-digit kind of levels on the biotech side? Tom Joyce : Sure. Let's start with the overall market. In general, the life science end markets remain very good. And we put up 7% core growth across our life science businesses in Q1, so another really strong quarter. This is a fourth straight quarter of a high single-digit growth across our life science businesses. And we're making -- it happen organically through better innovation at each one of the businesses, more innovative new products launched on time, commercialized effectively, and some tremendous investments in taking our products to market in each one of the businesses. And that's, by the way without IDT being core. IDT goes core here in this quarter, and they're off to a terrific start and really beating our initial expectations. So I think the combination of our good execution in fundamentally solid end markets sets up really well for continued performance in life sciences. We continue to see good performance across the biopharma end market, our single use technologies. And the work that we're doing around continuous bioprocessing is garnered tremendous interest in the end marketing. And we're seeing sales continue to grow in those areas, but applied markets have been solid, academic and research has been solid, and even the smaller portions of sort of the industrially oriented life science market has been solid as well. Geographically, China, as you've heard me mentioned already, continuous strong U.S. a good quarter. And Europe, I would say is stable, but that the markets that we're watching closely. And it's held up so far. But there are always some concerns about what's going on in Europe at the moment. So we're watching that carefully. In terms of Pall going a little deeper there, we have very good visibility to the product development pipelines of both large and small pharma customers and biotechs. We continue to work those early stage opportunities well. And I think that's what bodes very well for continuing this high single-digit growth across Pall and the double-digit growth across our biotech business around SET, continuous bioprocessing. And really innovative products like the iCELLis bioreactor that I talked about in my prepared remarks. So overall, it's the -- that end markets good placed to be right now. Ross Muken : And maybe just on Dental, obviously, we see in the margin a little bit more investment there but the growth albeit an easier comp kind of improved. I guess how are you thinking, in general, about sort of the trajectory there and kind of what you put into the business and sort of types of investments that are being made now ahead of sort of the potential separation? Tom Joyce : Sure. We're very encouraged, actually to see the better top line performance that we put up and the underlying market stabilization that that underpins some of that. But our performance we believe, beyond the market stabilization has really been driven by the new product innovation that we continue to invest in, as well as some of the investments around commercialization. Some of those investments are really specific to things like our clear aligner program and our intraoral scanner and a number of new products that I mentioned earlier around Nobel. And so these are -- we believe these are really important investments to be made strategically to set this business up for success. If we look at the quarter, we saw sellout continue to be pretty encouraging, and that's pretty broad based. Even more encouraging, I think around the traditional consumables and equipment, which had struggled in the past, and where we had adjusted inventories with the channel in the past. Now channel inventories are really in good shape. So I think we combined those investments with and improved cost structure that we worked so hard to establish. And you heard me talk about this before about how we rationalize the cost structure around the overall footprint of the business over the last three to four years. I think we'll continue to see some incremental improvements in the growth rates, and particularly in the second half around core operating margins. So I think, second straight quarter a solid low single-digit core growth and a little better than our expectations. And I think we're positioning the business well for later in the year. Ross Muken : And quick one, Matt, it looked like with the dilution from the equity deal, net sort of the deep, the underlying operating guide, you actually came up. I don't know maybe a $0.05 or so. I guess, if we think about the Q1 being fairly balanced top and margin line, is there anything notable in terms of that delta, and in terms any of the segments or if it's more an organic versus OMX type tweak? Matt McGrew : No. I think your frame of kind of talking about kind of got the -- for the full year, the change being kind of $0.09 of dilution from the equity offering, kind of offset by that $0.04 beat. And that $0.04 beat is very operational, was pretty broad across most of our segments, I think came in better than we thought here. So, yes, that $0.05 reduction, I think is the way to think about it is that it's $0.09 of dilution offset by $0.04 operational beat here in the quarter. Yes, kind of results if you take a step back, and we kind of look at it, we're going to have EPS growth here for the full year, call it 6%, 7% now. And effectively, we've got all the dilution from the equity issuance kind of behind us as we get into the second quarter. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Maybe just building off of Ross's last question, Q1 core growth was 5.5%, and you expect core growth of 4% to 5% in the second quarter against a tougher year-over-year comparison. While Q3 has another tough comp you get an extra selling day in Q4. I understand why you might not want to provide a formal update to top line guidance given we're only two weeks into the second quarter and only around three months into the year. And that's said, I haven't heard anything coming off of a strong Q1 that would suggest there's any change in positive trend or that there were any transitory issues that made Q1 uniquely strong. So mathematically, it does seem like you're on track to exceed your original full year core revenue growth guidance of 4% by at least 50 odd basis points, if not a little bit more. Is there anything I'm missing here? Matt McGrew : No, I mean, I think like you said, we're very encouraged by Q1. The underlying market does remain good. I don't think we would dispute that. But kind of that being said, like we've talked about before, we are -- as you mentioned we are three months, and we typically like to kind of get through the second quarter here. We'll kind of comeback folks in July. Talk to the second half of the full year. We'll kind of update everybody there. We've done that last couple of years, and that's worked out well. So clearly, we feel good about where we're at. But we're going to kind of do that again and we update everybody in July here. Doug Schenkel : The second topic is SCIEX. I was hoping to get a bit more color on performance in the quarter. I believe you indicated growth moderated to low single-digit levels if I heard that correctly. So it -- one way the other would be helpful to get a bit more color on product mix, geographic trends and recognizing your bid under index to bio pharma within this business relative to peers. It would be good to hear how demand in that end market shaped up in the quarter. And then looking ahead, I think you noted that you were up against the tough clinical comp within this business, but that's said SCIEX grew at least high single-digits every quarter last year. I'm just wondering if you are expecting continued moderation in SCIEX growth over the balance of the year, if you expect this to pick up. Tom Joyce : I think you've got most of the facts. We did have a tough comp overall. We were high single-digits, in fact, in the first quarter, a year ago. And at this point, we're sort of coming off our fourth straight quarter, as you know, of high single-digit core growth. It was, as I mentioned, largely driven by pretty meaningful declines in clinical market, which is skewed towards North America. And that was up meaningfully in the first quarter of '18. So we can kind of do the direct comp to those to that particular -- our end markets. The other end markets are generally pretty solid. The farmer market really pretty good. If we look geographically, that market is pretty solid on a global basis. The applied markets are good. That's kind of a food testing oriented market. There's sort of a nascent market around cannabis testing where that we expect to grow over time, and the academic markets pretty good. So I think aside from that challenging comp around clinical, we feel pretty good about where we sit relative to those end markets. We have a broader footprint today with Phenomenex in separations consumables. That business was up mid single-digits. And our service business, which has always been an important part of both growth and margin expansion at SCIEX, continues to be good as well, generally tracking high single-digits to low single-digits. So we feel good about how that business is positioned despite that tough comp. And I think we'll see some improvement over time. Matt McGrew : Yes, Doug, we're like Tom just said, and we are kind of expecting here kind of mid single-digit for the second quarter and the balance of the year here from an outlook perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard : Hello, I will stick with a question on the tools business. So first off, you mentioned strengths in flow cytometry and centrifugation and Beckman tools. Can you flag for me, what are the applications driving that strengths? And I'm specifically wondering if there's any play here on some of the cell therapies that you're seeing strength and other parts of your platform? Tom Joyce : Sure, Dan. In terms of flow cytometry, the real strength of that business is around leukemia and lymphomas. And I think the combination of our historical technologies with the more breakthrough technologies that have been associated with our acquisition just a few years ago of Xitogen that is now led to the innovations embedded in our CytoFLEX product line. The combination of those strong application areas with more novel technologies have really helped to drive the flow cytometry business pretty consistently. It's been a key growth driver for Beck LS for a number of quarters. Centrifugation is a much more broadly defined set of applications. We play in a number of different segments from an end market perspective. And it was an architecture that's generally oriented towards higher volumes, certainly above the table top kinds of volumes. And, but I wouldn't attribute centrifugation purely to any particular end market. I think the team's done a nice job with innovation around centrifugation. They've done a nice job in terms of positioning their commercial organization more effectively in terms of being able to take those products to market more broadly across that fragmented end market. And I think those are the underlying sources of growth at Beck LS. Dan Leonard : And just a quick follow up. Can you offer us the Cepheid growth rate in the quarter, excluding the flu comp? And is it safe to assume that that business gets back to double-digit growth in Q2 and beyond? Tom Joyce : Yes. So if you think about Cepheid, excluding kind of flu in the high growth markets HBDC stuff, it was up double-digits. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Erin Wright : So on the Dental side, do you think we're at an inflection point here? Have you seen stabilization continuing quarter-to-date? And can you breakdown the trends that you're seeing across both North America and rest of the world what's driving more growth? And if you could just give us an update on the timeline of the spin, when we should hear more about your outlook for remain co business, et cetera? Thanks. Tom Joyce : Erin, I don't know that I would call this an inflection point. I think we've seen now over at least the last two, maybe even three quarters of progressing level of stabilization. And when we measure that stabilization in terms of some things that caused some disruption in the past, a series of adjustments in the channel relative to exclusive relationships between manufacturers and distributors, some disruption among some channel sales forces, some inventory bill that needed to be rectified, all of those things really over -- that was a really over a couple year period, I think, evolved to a point where we now have a much more stable end market. And we're seeing that both in terms of the alignment between our sell-in and sell-out through the channel, we look at it in terms of inventories, we look at it by category to see how the traditional consumables and equipment are trending versus the more specialized products. And so, in general, I would say the overall trend in the market today could certainly be called a far more stable than it was a year or two ago. In terms of the broader trends that are happening in the market, I would say continued move towards what would be broadly described as digital dentistry, the importance of imaging systems, and particularly -- and that's an area where our KaVo Kerr business is real leader in imaging technologies. And the linkage of those imaging technologies through software to treatment planning and treatment execution with important novel innovations happening in term, in the specialty areas, our implant business around Nobel continues to be a leader in those areas, where digital dentistry really matters, where imaging leads to treatment planning, leads to novel implant systems and procedures that end up with greater levels of patient satisfaction. And I think that's a broad based trend, not just in North America, but really on a global basis. I think the other thing that\u2019s certainly noteworthy is the emerging middle class, and the importance of dentistry in our in high growth markets. China being one, we've talked a lot about being double digits. But we're going to see good growth across our Dental platform in a number of markets where an emerging middle class is putting greater demands on the practice of dentistry.  And then finally, around your question around the timeline of the spin, we remain focused on the timeline as we've laid it out, which is to affect that spin late this year. The intention is to launch an IPO of that business. And that was largely be a business that would probably put 19.9% of that -- of that equity into the market. And we would retain of the balance that for a period of time. And so there's been no change to those plans. Erin Wright : And then this is a bigger picture kind of broader question, just there has been a lot of volatility in the market, primarily to speak alone, just on reimbursement, regulatory kind of concepts here in the U.S., and regardless of the actual likelihood of anything actually being implemented. How do you think about some of the opportunities, risk factors across your business? When it comes to some of these concepts related to reimbursement pressures, drug pricing scrutiny, more recently PAMA, for instance. What are you seeing there? And are there -- is there anything that you're more meaningfully concerned about from a reimbursement perspective that could impact your business or your customer base? Thanks. Tom Joyce : To cut right to a simple answer to your question about, are we incrementally concerned about something around the dynamics that you just mentioned. The answer would be no. Yes, there are lots of things being bandied about around healthcare and reimbursement today and the Affordable Care Act, those at the moment are not having any material impact on us whatsoever, or immaterial impact. PAMA, we\u2019ve seen occasional impacts of that. But then again, price pressures are our standard operating procedure in the diagnostic markets. I think, Erin, probably you step back from our business for a moment, and you think about what we do in diagnostics, providing diagnostic capabilities to hospitals in the central laboratory, in anatomical pathology, in acute care, in the emergency room, in molecular diagnostics for acutely ill patients around infectious disease. Diagnostics today represents about 2% of costs of healthcare broadly defined. And yet it informs well north of 60% of the decisions that are ultimately made in healthcare today. So we play a vital role in the overall market, but are relatively small portion of the overall cost structure. And while the factors that you mentioned are very important for us to attend to keep in mind, and be aware of any potential impacts. Today there hasn't been any meaningful change in any of those in the recent quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Tom just a follow up on the Dental business. Any chance you could tease out the performance of the traditional portfolio versus the specialty lines in the first quarter and then, specifically curious how the U.S. consumables business did in the period? Tom Joyce : I think pretty solid, as I mentioned, second straight quarter of low single-digit growth across the platform. So we feel pretty good about all of that. The orthodontics business was up mid single-digits. And we see really good performance across those businesses. Nobel was up low single-digits, but on a tougher Q1 comp, but still mid single-digits on a 2-year stack basis, and generally in line with what we've seen the last couple of years. I think in both of these cases, around specialty consumables, we're making significant investments in new product innovation. Obviously, around clear liners and then the digital support through intraoral scanners that will really make a difference in our orthodontics business over time. We have new Damon level, Damon line products that have been introduced into the market as well. And then at Nobel, these new surface technologies are exciting new technologies that are going to make a difference over time. And so, I think today those businesses are tracking reasonably well, but we're really encouraged by the new product innovations that are coming out in both of them. North American traditional consumables and equipment remain good, low single-digit growth with a reasonably stable market. The imaging business, as the trends are good. We're seeing mid single-digit growth around imaging. And when we look at sell-out, the sell-out looks pretty solid. So we're continuing to manage sell-in to make sure the channel inventories are in line. So we don't have that kind of disruption in the future. And I think, overall, we feel pretty good about where the Dental platform fits today. Brandon Couillard : And so maybe a follow-up for Matt. EAS segment continues to be pretty solid, pricing up 1.5 in the period. Can you talk about the sustainability of that and where that's coming from? And secondly, what do you think pricing might improve somewhat of the Dental business? And what's been, I guess about five quarters of weakness on Dental pricing? Matt McGrew : Yes, that's -- I was going to say general kind of in that range for the last four or five quarters. I'm not sure that we've got anything intentional that is driving that in Dental. So that seems to kind of be the runway of where they operate here today. So I'm not sure there's kind of an inflection or change that's necessarily being planned for Dental. As far as EAS goes, yes, they do a very nice job in pricing. I think it's -- both of those businesses have been around a little bit longer than some of our other businesses. And we talked about kind of some of the things that they're able to do and passing through some of the prices that they get. So I'm not sure there's anything from a trend perspective there that will change either. I think we've seen price there in that range for the last four or five quarters. I'm not sure a whole lot that was new here in the quarter from price perspective. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Daniel Brennan of UBS. Daniel Brennan : I wanted to ask first starting on GE. If you could share some -- maybe some of the early customer feedback that you're receiving, I mean should that learn if some of the customers look at the combined Danaher and GE offerings, possibly providing some share gains to be possible broader solutions provider? Tom Joyce : Our team has spent expensive time with customers. We obviously share quite a number of customers. And we also the opportunity in situations where we don't share customers to potentially bring a broader portfolio of solutions to that end market. I was actually, as I mentioned earlier in my comment, I was actually in China last week or two weeks ago, and actually met with the -- one of the key customers in the end market. And I think they represent sort of broadly a view across that market of real enthusiasm. GE does a tremendous job in the China market as does our Pall business. And I think the opportunities that those end customers see today are for really innovative solutions where we can bring a broader perspective to the overall bioproduction workflow, and work collaboratively with them to ensure that we meet not only their needs of today, but the needs that they'll have as their capacity expands over time. And as they evolve their processes, more towards single use technologies and more towards continuous bioprocessing capabilities. They see the combination of the broad set of tools that we bring at Danaher not just associated with Pall, but across the broader portfolio, and then inclusive of GE is being something really exciting. Daniel Brennan : And maybe just one final follow up just on China. Obviously, the growth has been tremendous there, but with the tariff noise in the economy grinding lower, that's always a question mark with how sustainable that is. Maybe could you just characterize amongst your four different businesses and all the different secular initiatives China has ongoing likely. Where do you see the biggest runway still for growth dependent upon like where China is with some of their kind of secular -- kind of build out if you will? Thank you. Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks, Daniel. It's almost hard to choose because when we think about the investments that are being made in China, in diagnostics, in life sciences, and in and around the environment, along with the dynamics, I just mentioned, a couple of minutes ago, around an evolving middle class and the needs for advanced dentistry, there are important secular drivers in really, I would say, all four of those markets that I just mentioned. And I think we feel that our leadership position in each one of those markets has served us well in the past. We continue to enhance that those leadership positions with innovative products, some of which are designed in China, and many of which are made in China for the Chinese market, combined with continued investments in feet on the street and end market facing associates who are continually looking for new and novel solutions to drive innovation for customers. Those are just great end markets to be in. So I'm not sure, I'd necessarily differentiate a great deal between the diagnostics life sciences, the environmental and the Dental end markets, because I think they all represent important secular drivers that will benefit we have benefited from in the past, and we benefit from in the future. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Laurie. And thanks, everyone, for joining us.

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thank you Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased for our strong second quarter performance. We delivered 5.5% core revenue growth, we continued investments in innovation and commercial initiatives contributing to share gains across many of our businesses. This marks the seventh straight quarter of 5% or better core growth which combined with solid operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow is a testament to our team\u2019s focused execution and the power of the Danaher Business System. We also continue to make progress on our anticipated acquisition of GE Biopharma and the planned IPO of our Dental business and both transactions remain on track relative to our previously communicated expectations. As we move into the second half of 2019 we\u2019re excited about these important portfolio moods and the opportunities that lie ahead for Danaher. So now let\u2019s turn to our second quarter results. Sales grew 3.5% to $5.2 billion, with core revenue growth of 5.5%. Acquisitions increased revenues by 1%, while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 3%. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single-digits led by double-digit growth in India and approximately 10% growth in China. We saw mid single-digit growth across the developed markets with both the U.S. and Western Europe growing in that range. Gross margin for the first quarter was 55.8%, and operating profit margin was 17.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year. However, core operating margin increased 15 basis points despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar year-on-year. We\u2019ve generated $1 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter resulting in double digit growth year-on-year and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 137%. So now let's take a more detailed look at our second quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 6.5% with 7.5% core revenue growth. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of high single digit or better core revenue growth in the segment. Reported operating profit margin was up 190 basis points to 20.1% with core operating margins increasing 170 basis points. This terrific margin performance was a result of the team's outstanding DBS driven execution across the segment. Beckman Life Sciences\u2019 core revenue growth with a high single digit as performance was led by double-digit growth in both flow cytometry and particle counting and characterization. The strength in particle counting was led by Vi-CELL product line which is primarily used analyze to cell viability in biopharmaceutical applications. In addition Beckman closed the both on acquisition of Cytobank a software solution that pairs with our flow cytometry platform to help biopharma and clinical research customers analyze complex datasets more quickly and efficiently. Core revenue at SCIEX grew at a mid-single digit rate. Good results across the pharmaceutical and applied end markets were partially offset by the continued impact of a tough comparison in our North American clinical business. We've made significant investments to improve the cadence of innovation at SCIEX since we acquired the business nearly 10 years ago. The team highlighted several new products last month at ASMS including Echo MS a non-contact liquid handling solution with very high analytical throughput. This first-of-its-kind technology enables mass spectrometry\u2019s rich data generation to be used in new applications within the drug development workflow helping customers in their pursuit a breakthrough disease treatments. At Pall, high single-digit core revenue growth was driven by broad-based strength across most major geographies and end markets. Pall Industrial was up mid single digits with strong results in our aerospace and process and industrial businesses. This was partially offset by microelectronics which declined due to a tough prior year comparison and softer end markets. Double-digit growth in Pall Life Sciences was led by our biotech business where we saw broad-based demand across product lines. An important highlight during the quarter with the U.S. FDA's approval of a pediatric gene therapy which is manufactured using Pall's iCELLis bioreactor. So Zolgensma is the first gene therapy to treat spinal muscular atrophy or SMA in children under the age of 2. SMA is the number one genetic cause of death for infants and Pall is proud to contribute to the breakthrough treatment for this devastating disease. The second quarter marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of IDT and we couldn't be happier with the progress the team has made so far. IDT delivered another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth driven by broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Moving now to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 4.5% with core revenue growth of 7.5%. Reported operating margin was 17.5% with reported and core margins down 20 basis points. This decline is predominantly attributable to the impact of foreign currency headwinds related to the stronger U.S. dollar and tariff related costs. At Beckman Diagnostics, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was driven by high growth markets, particularly China. By product line, immunoassay and automation led the way. Momentum from recent product launches is benefiting Beckman in a number of key product areas, enhancing the business' competitive position and accelerating its growth trajectory. We are particularly encouraged by ongoing improvements in our hematology business where we continue to see strong global demand for our new DxH 900 high-volume analyzer. Radiometer achieved high single digit core revenue growth with strength across the developed markets and China. Our blood gas and AQT product lines both performed well with key competitive wins contributing to market share gains. Leica Biosystems\u2019 core revenue was up mid-single digits. Good results across Advanced Staining and core histology were driven by demand for recently introduced products and we believe LBS continued to take share relative to the market. Finally, at Cepheid core revenue is up more than 20% on continued momentum in North America and strong results across high growth markets. Cepheid embrace of DBS growth tools and processes like transformative marketing and funnel management has enabled the team to make meaningful progress penetrating new accounts were particular success at integrated delivery networks in North America. Turning to our Dental segment, reported revenue declined 3%, and core revenue was down 50 basis points. Reported operating profit margin declined to 11.2% with core and reported margins down 310 basis points. This decline primarily reflects the impact of lower volume, foreign exchange rate movements and ongoing investment spend focused on new product development. Low single digit declines in our traditional consumables and equipment business were partially offset by low single-digit core growth in our specialty businesses. Geographically double-digit growth in China was more than offset by continued softness in Western Europe and Latin America. As part of our expansion into clear aligners our orthodontics business Ormco highlighted Spark at the American Association of orthodontists tradeshow in May. Spark is made using TruGen a proprietary material with exceptional flexibility and clarity which provides a highly aesthetic and comfortable aligner capable of treating complex cases. Following a successful initial launch in Australia we are previewing Spark with a group of leading orthodontists in the U.S. as part of our targeted expansion and expect to build on this good early traction going forward. We continue to make good progress towards the intended IPO of our Dental business. We\u2019ve recently announced the new company's name Envista and have identified its key senior leaders and future operating structure. We remain on track to establish Envista as a separate publicly trading company in the second half of this year. Moving to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 2% and core revenue was up 4%. Reported operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23.4% with 45 basis points of core margin expansion. In Product Identification, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. Videojet core revenue was up low single digits versus a high single digit prior year comparison. Results were led by growth in Western Europe and high-growth markets with solid underlying end market demand worldwide. In our packaging business which includes Esko and X-Rite we were encouraged by better sequential performance and ongoing improvements in order trends. A few weeks ago Esko hosted more than 200 customers at the Esko World User Group Meeting in Nashville. The event brings together brand owners and suppliers from across the packaging workflow to showcase Esko's solutions and provides the unique forum for Esko to gather industry insight to guide impactful product innovation. Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform was up mid-single digits. At Trojan double digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across the developed markets in China. We saw solid demand in the municipal and industrial end markets and the team sustained its strong customer win rate with good commercial execution and new product differentiation. ChemTreat delivered high single digit core revenue growth. The North American and Latin American markets continue to lead the way with strong results in food and beverage, commercial facilities, and oil and gas. Lastly at Hach, core revenue grew in a low single-digit rate versus a double-digit prior year comparison. Good performance in North America and Western Europe benefited from demand across the municipal and industrial end markets. This was partially offset by declines in China which was meaningfully last year as a result of government initiatives around surface water monitoring which generated significant demand for Hach's unique offering. 2019 marks Hach's 20th year as part of Danaher making it one of the longest tenured operating companies in our portfolio today and a tremendous example of how we grow businesses and build platforms at Danaher. Through a combination of organic execution and strategic M&A with a commitment of DBS and a foundation of continuous improvement Hach has evolved from a $130 million business in 1999 to what is now the cornerstone of our $2.5 billion Water Quality platform. During that time the platform has increased growth and operating profit margins by over 1500 basis points and completed more than 25 acquisitions to augment growth and adjacencies in water treatment byTrojan and ChemTreat. This combination of organic and inorganic initiatives has helped drive consistent share gains and build sustainable long-term value with the platforms\u2019 return on invested capital now in excess of 20%. You'll get to hear more about this success story at our upcoming water quality investor day in September and we hope that many of you will be able to join us for the event out at Hach's headquarters in Loveland, Colorado. So to wrap up we feel good about the momentum we generated in the first half of 2019. The remainder of this year will be transformational for Danaher with the anticipated IPO of Envista and welcoming GE Biopharma to our Life Science platform. Both incredibly important portfolio moves that we expect to maximize value for our shareholders, customers and associates. We believe the combination of our differentiated portfolio the Danaher team\u2019s DBS driven execution and our commitment to build long-term value uniquely positions us for strong performance through 2019 and beyond. We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.12 and $1.15 which assumes core growth of approximately 4.5%. We now expect full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.80. Matt Gugino : Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Laurie we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Congrats on another solid quarter. Tom, on the more industrial focused market, it doesn't sound like you're flagging any sort of softness or issues there. I know you had the tougher videojet comp but you did mention I think better quarter-over-quarter in order to trends and packaging so can you just talk on the outlook for Pall Industrial Product ID packaging some of these more industrial focused markets given some of the macro data points? Tom Joyce : Sure Tycho. Happy to, as I think you probably know well, we don't have a lot of truly industrial exposure left in the portfolio today. Call it 10% or less of the overall portfolio so admittedly we're perhaps not a great read but I'm happy to share with you some of the details behind some of the specific businesses that you asked about. In terms of the trends we're seeing broadly defined across these businesses, in general they're still pretty solid. Let's call it low single digit, mid-single digit growth rates across these businesses that I'll tell you about in a little bit more detail. So maybe let's start with say a portion of Hach. So Hach has some industrial exposure that the industrial side of Hach was up mid-single digits in the quarter. The order trends remain pretty solid across both the U.S. and Europe. Overall Hach was with low single digits in the second quarter but again that was against that big double-digit comp last year that impacted us in China. So again just look at the industrial side, pretty solid. You mentioned Pall industrial again another portion that maybe worth a little bit of a read. Pall industrial up mid single-digits in the quarter. So pretty good performance. Where we saw a little bit of softness was certainly in microelectronics that was expected. We clearly have some difficult comps there two years of double digit growth and that market has clearly softened up based on lot that\u2019s going on in terms of the trade dynamics and that's \u2013 that market is probably not likely to improve much in the second half of the year but so that's a little bit of a soft spot there, but at Pall industrial that was more than offset by our aerospace business and what we call FTAP which is fluid technologies and asset protection both aerospace and FTAP were up double digits in the quarter. So again put that altogether mid single digit growth Pall Industrial, pretty solid VJ, you mentioned VJ again a little bit of exposure there at VJ. That was up again depending on the sub-segment low single digit to mid single digits, pretty small numbers at DJ but against your trends were pretty solid. And DJ's overall comp was although low single digit in the quarter, was again the high single digit prior year. So net we keep a very close eye on what's going on in these sub-markets. We do think they can be indicative of maybe some broader trends but our order trends remain pretty steady and again we don't have a ton of exposure but happy to keep bringing those indicators forward for everybody so sort of broader sense of the macro. Tycho Peterson : That's helpful and maybe similar line of questions on China. I mean you had 10% growth double digit in Dental, you are under indexed to maybe food and four plus seven generic headwinds but as we think about the back half of the year and the China picture any reason that that couldn't continue at double digit levels for you guys. Tom Joyce : Yes. Thanks. We feel very good about where we are in China. Obviously, that starts with the nature of our platform's positions there. When you think about Life Sciences diagnostics, Water Quality, the concerns around the environment, certainly even our Dental business which continues to be really well-positioned there and growing strongly, starting in the broad sense of the platform position we love where those businesses and how that platform is positioned for the secular growth drivers in China. And despite the headlines which clearly indicates that there are some slowing in China we continue to see pretty good underlying conditions and I think just to go through a few specifics, diagnostics was very strong. We're talking mid-teens kind of growth there especially at Cepheid which is again off the small base but continued to grow nicely. Beckman is doing well there. Another strong quarter of life sciences of high single digits and of course dental demand continuing a double-digit growth. So good performance there. Product ID again a smaller position in China, but pretty solid mid-single digit growth, but as I mentioned this again is probably a couple of more puts and takes there in China than we might normally have seen. Water quality being one of those against this federal mandate that existed last year around service monitoring. So that's a little bit of an impact and again what I mentioned about micro down and even that [FTAP] business probably a touch lighter. So a few little pockets there but again if we step back broadly I think we're in good shape there. As we look forward I think we'll continue to see mid-single digits to high single digit growth in Q3, but again that's only because of really this tougher comp where we had high teens, growth in Q3 of \u201818 largely driven by the water quality business. So we don't really see a meaningful slowdown in our businesses at this point, but clearly given the headlines and the data that's been put out more recently, the ongoing trade tensions, we're watching these businesses very, very closely and we will continue to update as we see things. Tycho Peterson : Okay and then just one last clarification you got \u2013 guidance for Dental margins to be flat. I know they are down 300 basis points. How much of that was incremental investment and how should we think about Dental margins for 3Q and 4Q? Tom Joyce : We're clearly continuing to invest around new products in that business but the lower volumes, I think are meaningful here, Tycho. It\u2019s certainly the investment is a function there and that we think it's important to set this business up effectively for the growth to come and you've seen us lift R&D spending by 100 basis points over the last couple of years and so that portion of what we think is really essential to the future growth trajectory of the business but the volume trend is really what we need to get those new product innovations to begin to turn along with some just tailwind in that market. I think as we see that volume come back a bit that's going to be the incremental jump that we're going to need in terms of the OMX, so I think it's really a combination of those things that we'd be looking for certainly as we turn the corner into next year. I think as we look at the balance of this year we're going to continue to drive some of those investments. We're still going to have some challenges in terms of the overall growth in this market, but I think we remain very, very bullish about the prospects for this business to improve both the growth trajectory and the operating margins as we head into 2020 and beyond. Matt Gugino : Yes, Tycho. It\u2019s Matt. I mean some of the volume there too is on, if you think about specialty in the quarter was kind of low single digits that typically is some of our better margin business and so I think from a mixed perspective like Tom said that lower volume and kind of where it happened here in the quarter was a big piece it. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Tom Joyce : Thanks Tycho. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Tom Joyce : Good morning Ross. Ross Muken : Good morning guys. Congrats. So maybe I just want to go back to Diagnostics. I mean I felt like Cepheid probably north of 20 in the quarter. I mean, obviously, Q1 you had some tough flu comps. So I guess that that's a pretty remarkable growth where it feels even above sort of trailing 12-months levels. So I guess help us understand whether it's sort of a new product or some of the GeneXpert or just placements or new menu like or geographic, where is that upside sort of coming from and we sort of that the sort of key stages of the DBS flywheel sort of getting this business kind of churning at the rate it maybe should get too? Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks Ross. You termed the flywheel is one where we love a lot, and obviously from that standpoint turning the flywheel, I would say it's still early days at Cepheid and yet we've begun to turn that flywheel at a pretty good rate but there's still opportunities to continue to enhance the RPMs, if you will. So let me take it through a few of the details. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we were up north of 20% in the second quarter and some of that continues to come from our, what we call our HBDC market or High Burden Developing Country growth, but if you even backed out of the High Burden Developing Countries where we continue to see good growth, Cepheid continued to be up mid-teens in many of the core areas and core assays. So that growth continues to be really broad-based. Infectious disease led the way, flu, RSV, Strep all strong, sexual health also very good. The flu season and normally by the time we get into July here, we're not usually talking about flu, but just to go back a second, it did last \u2013 it lingered a little bit longer into April, which probably on the margin helped growth a bit as well. So I think the combination of things, with very good performance in the core assays and the developed markets and then continued good performance in HBDC. From a DBS perspective, a number of key things going on from an innovation and commercial execution perspective that are helping us to continue to drive share gains. We've netted over 300 new customers since acquisition, which is really meaningful in terms of not only the installed base that is built, but obviously the annuity stream that's associated with those captive consumables. So that market leading installed base is now north of 20,000 instruments. We closed, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mentioned IDNs. We've closed a number of major health systems or IDNs and that is again continuing to drive the installed base with strong annuity streams. The anchor assays, like flu and Strep A are key to develop to driving those wins. And I think over time we're going to, we're going to see some penetration in the physician office labs in an even deeper way with our CLIA-waived Xpress offerings and because I think those will be an important part of it. So overall, I think the team is in great shape. I was with the team at Cepheid in the early part of the year and they continue to perform exceptionally well. But I think it's still early days. I think one way to think about the early days is in terms of geographic penetration. We're still coming off a relatively small base in China, but the molecular diagnostics opportunity in China is really strong. Today, China is still probably sub-5% of Cepheid and it's going to be significantly bigger than that as years go on. We're working on getting beyond the initial test that we have approved in China, which are really around MTB and C. diff, HIV viral load, etc and we continue to build the sales force, it's up by 3X times where we started. And we got 4x or 5x the revenue. So again, small base, early days, but I think plenty of room to go. Ross Muken : And maybe just on the pharma side, I know you called out biotech at least relative to Pall, but more broadly, I guess, how would you kind of characterize small versus large molecule demand across the portfolio? And specifically to Tycho's point before in China, any sort of anecdotal things and when we were there, it seemed quite like biologics and bio-manufacturing was on absolute fire, so just any color would be helpful. Tom Joyce : Sure. I think in terms of small versus large, I think we continue to see solid growth from the segment of market that's more oriented toward small molecule. Well, Ross that that's sort of our legacy, if we looked at the SCIEX business as an example of that, continued solid performance across the small molecule business, large molecule, biologics is where the faster growth is, and we see that in our Pall numbers. The Pall Life Science business up double-digits. The biotech part of that was really led by our single-use technologies and that's, those are \u2013 those single-use technologies are significantly oriented, it's not exclusively oriented to the biologic side of the house. iCELLis, I mentioned iCELLis and the iCELLis bioreactor continues to be a big source of growth for us. We look at the areas of cell and gene therapy as huge opportunities. And again, it's still early days in those markets. So I'd say coming through at all, small molecule, solid, pretty consistent large molecule, continued strong growth. You asked specifically about China. Thanks, thanks for your recent visit. That market is going quite well. But again, I think that's still a market that is in development. A lot of the history there began in the small molecule area, some of what's going on there around biosimilars is clearly a source of growth. But that market will continue to evolve over time. There is a tremendous amount of government investments that's going on, as you also probably found when you were there. And so we're very bullish about how our business in Life Science, is not just on, by the way that the process technologies you might say around filtration and ultimately around chromatography. But I think our tools business as well, whether we're talking about SCIEX and the evolution of the use of mass spectrometry in large molecules or the use of our other Life Science tools around biologic drug development and discovery. Those businesses are all tracking well. Ross Muken : Super, helpful. Thanks Tom. Tom Joyce : You bet Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Tom Joyce : Derik, good morning. Derik De Bruin : Good morning. How you all doing? Tom Joyce : Great. Thanks. Nice to hear from you. Derik De Bruin : Thank you. Couple of questions so I guess the first one would be you mentioned in your comments about like a bio that you were seeing some shared gains there and given the joining of a couple of real competitors that market and just sort of curious about the additional color on what's driving the share gains and some dismay any information on that would be a good place to start? Tom Joyce : Sure. Yeah, you bet, happy to. First of all, we have a terrific team on that business today. Melissa Aquino who I have worked with for a long time, actually came out of our Water Quality business, ran our DBS office prior to this role is leading that business today, and just doing a wonderful job, both in terms of driving new product execution as well as the commercial side of the house. One of the things that I've been particularly impressed with is, I was with that business earlier this year, Derik, they've got the new product engines now working in that business. We struggled a bit three, four, five years ago with getting products out of R&D on time. They were great products, they ultimately were targeted at the right market. We are now getting those out faster. The rate of new product introduction is higher than it's ever been before and we're seeing the impact of that in the growth rates both in histology, the core microtome tissue processor, what you might think of is kind of the more [indiscernible] stuff is at the front end of anatomical pathology, as well as better growth rates and more product innovation around advanced staining. We still have work to do around path imaging, you recall years ago, we did the acquisition of Aperio, we think there's tremendous opportunities around the evolution of digital pathology. We have \u2013 I think many of \u2013 much of the tool set, that it takes to move pathology imaging into the mainstream, if you will, of anatomical pathology, but we've got some product development that continues to need to be done. And frankly, it's a market that's slow to adapt to those technologies, and we will need to be a little bit patient as those transitions take place within the community of pathologists. But a lot of good things going on there, but I would point primarily to product development engine, now running far more smoothly and efficiently. Derik De Bruin : Great. And then just two related questions, one, can you just give us any update on sort of GE and timing on that whole process? And also just sort of a follow-up on Ross' question. When you think about small molecules and large molecules in cell and gene therapies, can you compare, sort of like the profitability for some of those markets. The question I'm getting to is like as you move into providing products Zolgensma and just some of these other ones that are out there. I'm just curious is those are going to be a higher margin, higher products for you, more profitable products for you, going and then doing \u2013 genomic supplying columns or supplying resins and filters for the biologics business? Tom Joyce : Sure. Let's take in there. But let me give it a shot. So let's have a key \u2013 first of all, we continue to be really impressed with the GE team, we mentioned that when we announced the deal, that we found that coming through due diligence. But as we normally do with large acquisitions, we put a transition team together, we acquired \u2013 the soon to be acquired business has a transition team. And so, we continue to get some exposure to that team and we remain really impressed by them, it's a highly passionate and talented group with great industry experience. As you saw in Q1 from them the business is off to a great start in 2019. What we've heard a little bit is just sort of very anecdotally that things continue to track quite well. Their first quarter was \u2013 at core growth above where they've been in the last couple of years. So all indications are the business is in wonderful shape. From a transaction standpoint, we issued the equity in Q1. Clearly, the debt financing ought to be helped by what we're seeing now in lower rates, assuming those kind of hold in both the U.S. and Europe and that's just in comparison to when we announced the deal. So overall, we feel very good about where we are. No change to our expectations. We've had good and constructive dialog with the regulators and we're working with them like we would on any other deal. And so we're continuing to drive toward a fourth quarter close and feel good about that. Relative to your second question, which was around small molecule versus large molecule cell and gene therapy, and profitability, and then you made specific reference to Zolgensma and the recent introduction of that breakthrough product by the division of Novartis, your question was really around profitability, I guess. First of all, going back to the core, we've always seen good profitability in our business around small molecule related applications and large molecule. I would say no difference. Obviously as we continue to develop breakthrough new products associated with the evolution of biological drug discovery, development and processes, we continue to focus on enhancing gross margins, as we drive new product development and so obviously the value that we deliver to shareholders is directly associated back to the gross margin that we're able to achieve. And so we continue to really keep the long horizon in mind, in terms of what the market needs are, and continue to drive products that will help to enhance gross margin, which they've done. And so we feel good about that. Now, when it comes to cell and gene therapy, it's so early in the evolution of that market today, that it's hard to say anything that's particularly material or quantitative around overall profitability, even our iCELLis product line, which is doing exceptionally well. It's still early days and its market penetration as fast as that pickup has been and as unique of that product is in the market. So more to come over time, but in general, our outlook is profitability looks very solid across this market. Zolgensma as you mentioned, you probably know from what's been publicized is a unique therapy, is a breakthrough, it's incredibly impactful to children under the age of two, and it's a very costly therapy. And that's a challenge in healthcare today is the cost of developing therapies and so on. But that's a dynamic that where quite a number of steps removed from when it comes to drug pricing and the relationship with the payers. And so I think the continued evolution of the technologies associated with these breakthroughs is going to be imperative for our customers today and we're proud to be a part of it, but we certainly recognize the challenges that are associated with how costly these have become. Just one last point, that many of you have probably heard me say that at Danaher, we have a, what we call our shared purpose and it's four simple words, helping realize life's potential, whether that's the potential for our associates or our customers, our shareholders. Ultimately in many respect patients and there's probably no better example of how we help realize life's potential when it comes to healthcare than when a tool of ours can play a role in really impacting the quality of life for patients. So we're proud to be a part of that and there is more to come and it's still early days. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Tom Joyce : Hey Dough. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to touch base to start on a few loose ends on Pall. How would you characterize win rates for Pall biotech, especially in the gene therapy space? I guess the second part is, I believe it was last quarter, you mentioned some building backlog for iCELLis, what's the status of that? And I guess the third part is, I'm curious if customer anticipation of the GE Bio acquisition is having any impact on Pall demand, clearly you're doing well there and you have been for a while, but just wondering if there is any attribution to anticipation of the GE Bio deal as customers think about the possibilities associated with you having a broader portfolio? And whether or not that is impacting demand at all? Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks, Doug. So first of all on Pall around win rates in gene therapy, and you mentioned specifically iCELLis and that's a good place to start when it comes to gene therapy. iCELLis is a unique product, not to suggest that there is only one way to affect what iCELLis affects in terms of bioreactor, but its capabilities are particularly unique in the market and as a result of that the leaders in that market segment associated with the projection steps in gene therapy have chosen iCELLis at a pretty consistent rate. And so, while I won't begin to quote right now a specific win rate percentage. I would tell you, it's just, it's very high and that has to do with the unique capabilities that iCELLis delivers in this market that is, it's difficult to do with the quality and the efficiency and the cost effectiveness that iCELLis allows for. So we feel very good about that, but again it's still because the gene and cell therapy market is still nascent today. We can feel great about that but the materiality of that is something that will only build over time. It will build at a reasonably rapid rate, but again a nascent market today. Your question specifically about the customer reaction or anticipation I guess as you framed it for the GE deal and impacting of Pall demand. I don't know today that we would point to anything specific in that regard, Doug. I would tell you quick sort of an anecdote,I was in China a couple of months ago and was it was with a significant Pall customer. They happen to be a GE customer as well as most large customers that I might meet with either in China or any high-growth market or even in the U.S. or Europe. But in this particular case, it was, there was an appreciation for the fact that the combination of those two businesses in terms of the type of service and support that that customer would expect, the fact that we become more meaningful to one another in a positive and constructive way was something that they feel very good about. And so those are just anecdotes. I don't know if there's anything we would point to today that is a demand impact today that we could see into relative to the top line. Doug Schenkel : Thank you for that. Beckman diagnostic where you guys grew mid single digits for the third consecutive quarter. Do you think this is the new norm and specifically in North America there is clearly been some improvement there over the last couple of quarters. How did that flare in North America for this quarter for Beckman Dx? Tom Joyce : Sure. Doug. And we obviously as that's an important battleground we paid a good deal of attention to that. As you said third straight quarter of mid single-digit growth. We feel very good about that. Some of the things that led the way are we continue to see very good growth in our immunoassay business in the core Central Lab. You'll recall that we had, we've developed and launched a new automation system the DxH system which has taken our competitive advantage in particularly high volume accounts to a new level. And so we feel very good about that, but probably one of the key things that is a difference today is our hematology business. And for those you Doug and others who follow us for a number of years, that even going back to the acquisition of Beckman to begin with hematology with the headwind. And so we made a significant amount of investment in new product development. We have transformed that product line. Those new products specifically around of both high and mid volume specifically in the high volume the DxH 900 as well as the early sepsis indicator capabilities that we have now launched are contributing together to turn the tide. We continually look at retention and win rates and we have seen those increment upward consistently over the last, particularly over the last two years and those new products around automation and hematology have clearly been a big part of it. China continues to be a strong driver for us at north of 10%. And so that's a plus as well. So the combination, still work to do, there is still minute gaps that we're working on that we \u2013 couple of critical ones that we will look to close more likely in 2020. And so I think we're continuing to see good performance. I think if you step back, just for one second and think about the impact this has had on the diagnostic platform. If you think about the improvement in Beck Dx now at mid-single digits with the addition of Cepheid now with its terrific performance . We now have a diagnostic platform with core growth at 7.5% that we think will as the comps come out will stack up reasonably well and now a platform that's been solidly mid-single digits for eight straight quarters. So I think Beckman is important certainly with the combination of Beckman with solid performance at Radiometer like the biosystems, and the high growth rate at Cepheid is really what solidified that stronger overall platform position and it's really the platform together. When we look at clinical chemistry immunoassay, hematology, urinalysis, microbiology and across the other modalities in anatomical pathology in acute care, that really is the right comp against some pretty good competitors. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Sorry to try to sneak in one more and then I'll like fall back to the queue. [indiscernible] No, this is all me. I've got a handful of investors ask me for updates on timing of the debt financing and if there is any real change and I think by extension upside what you guys embedded into your original deal model for interest expense assumptions. Could you speak to timing and whether there is any change in how you're thinking about maybe upside associated with interest expense? Thank you. MattMcGrew: Sure. Yeah, I mean from a timing perspective, I still think we've kind of talked about trying to be in the market a little bit closer to when we closed. I mean I think we're still talking about a Q4 close here. So I think that the timing will be a little bit closer to that, but as Tom kind of said, we talked about the GE update we issued the equity in Q1 and the debt financing here is clearly going to be held by the lower rates. There is no question about that. I mean, we're probably not going to update any of our guidance that we kind of provide to you earlier. But I think the combination of the tailwinds that the businesses \u2013 the GE business is off to a pretty good start and where the rates are right now, like we will have some sort of benefit. But I think from a timing perspective, still sort of TBD but a little bit closer to when we bring the kind of when we get to close here. Doug Schenkel : Thanks again. Matt McGrew : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Tom Joyce : Good morning Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Good morning. Thanks so much for the time here. Just a couple from me. I mean a couple of clarifications for Matt and then one on the commercial side for Tom. Matt, it sounds like the thinking for the core growth of the total company level is going higher relative to what we had before, is it fair to say that that, well, fair to say that first of all. And second of all, is that a reflection of a fairly balanced view across Environmental, Applied Diagnostics, Life Sciences. Second clarification for Matt is, has anything meaningfully changed in terms of non-op or tax rate outlook for the full year that you would flag here? And then I have one for Tom. Matt McGrew : Sure. So from guide perspective, I think for the full year, we had talked about at the beginning of the year, kind of, in December, we had talked about approximately 4% core for the whole year. Obviously, a pretty good start here with \u2013 in the first half and what we are \u2013 our guide here of approximately 4.5% in Q3. So I think from a full-year perspective, our thoughts now are that we are probably approximately 5% here for the full year from a core guide. As far as \u2013 balance on that. Yeah, I think, where we've seen in the first half as you see Life Sciences and Diagnostics have been much better and EAS, I think EAS would be the one piece in the second half given the water comp and the comp at PID, they are both here in Q3, going to be comping kind of their toughest comps in the quarter. But other than that, I suspect that it's been pretty balanced, I don't think we see a vast difference here in the first half or the second half, I think we just have had a little bit better start than we may have thought in December. As far as non-op stuff in tax, I don't think there's anything that I would call out, Steve, that would be different here in the second half. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Thanks, Matt. And then Tom, I wonder if you could reflect a little bit more on IDT and now that business in isolation. But what IDT in the broader life science portfolio is doing in terms of cross-selling opportunities. There's probably some synergy between IDT and Beck LS just to pick one example and just would be interested to hear about where you think you might be doing better in terms of share gains, not just as a function of the commercial investments, you've made. But in terms of product synergies whether it's around IDT or may be Phenomenex, as we've been hearing more about Phenomenex on checks here of late. Thanks so much. Matt McGrew : Sure, Steve. It probably will come across as somewhat surprising that despite what you might think across a broad set of analytical modalities that we provide in Life Sciences that there aren't a really significant number of cross-selling situations that we would point to that where there's real materiality. And the reason for that and I'll come back to IDT in a second. But the reason for that is that our operating company-centric model that we have maintained for virtually the entirety of Danaher's history is one that puts an extremely high value on an individual operating company and its commercial organizations being uniquely focused on the specific needs of that customer set. And we've seen a number of situations looking across different industries, where businesses have hoped for commercial synergies by bringing sales organizations together and creating heavier bags for their commercial organizations, thinking that customers actually were looking to buy a broader suite of instrumentation from the same sales team. When the reality is that only serve to dilute the focus, the technical capability, the level of service and support. And so we've actually maintained much more focus within our individual operating companies on the unique needs of that end-market's customers and really I think continue to maintain that even, in particular with newly acquired businesses. Going back to IDT, that approach to maintaining a unique focus of a commercial organization on their unique customers is particularly important for newly acquired businesses for us, because it's so easy to get the commercial organization confused by adding additional products to their bags from another operating company that ultimately dilutes that sales force's effectiveness, and so we look clearly for situations, where we can deliver higher value, I think you mentioned Phenomenex. Phenomenex and SCIEX are clearly a closer opportunity, where the synergy between chromatography column obviously and the sample preparation associated with mass spectrometry is much more technically and workflow oriented synergistic and so that's probably a better example of where we see that. And then in certain cases in high growth markets, I think I would point for example to our Dental business, where having a unified sales organization, bringing a consolidated set of products to a single end market, meaning the dental market in China, which has structured a little bit differently than the end markets in the developed countries. That's really delivered value and that's actually one of the things that has helped drive that double-digit sales growth in China, but again those are unique situations that we only do that where there is clarity around how we bring real value to customers. Steve Beuchaw : Well, that's great color. I really appreciate the time here this morning. Tom Joyce : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. I will now return the call to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing comments. Matt Gugino : Thanks Laurie and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We\u2019re around all day for questions.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter as we delivered 5% core revenue growth and solid core margin expansion. We believe our ongoing investments in innovation and commercial initiatives help to continue building sustainable competitive advantages across a number of our businesses. We also made meaningful progress on our two most recent portfolio moves, the acquisition of GE Biopharma and the initial public offering of our dental business. During the quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the GE Biopharma. Earlier this week, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain businesses to Sartorius for a purchase price of $750 million.  The revenue to be divested is approximately $140 million and consists of our label-free biomolecular characterization chromatography hardware and resins, microcarriers and particle validation standards businesses. All of these businesses are part of our life science platform. While the sale to Sartorius remains subject to certain regulatory approval, it represents a significant step in the GE Biopharma regulatory process. Timing around meeting certain closing conditions such as regulatory approvals can, of course, be uncertain. However, we remain very encouraged by the progress we're making and expect to close the GE Biopharma transaction in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, we recently announced that the business will be called Cytiva when it officially becomes part of Danaher. The name is derived from Greek and Latin roots, meaning cell and doing. And everything biopharma customers do relate to the use, growth or analysis of cells. The name may be new, but the Cytiva logo, or the drop, is actually a reference to the iconic Pharmacia brand of the business going back to the 1960s. Pharmacia was a pioneer in the development of process chromatography and was one of the first businesses to become part of GE Biopharma. We received terrific feedback on the reintroduction of the drop logo as we look to build on its legacy under the new Cytiva brand. And lastly, we continue to make progress on the financing of the GE transaction. In September, we raised approximately $6.8 billion in euro-denominated debt. We raised this debt at a combined interest rate of less than 1%, with an average maturity of approximately 14 years. We anticipate raising the remaining debt required to finance the transaction prior to year-end. On September 18, our dental platform, now called Envista, started trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker NVST. I want to thank Amir Aghdaei and all of the Envista associates for their contribution. We wish them the very best as they embark on this exciting new endeavor. Envista released their third quarter earnings earlier this morning and will be holding a conference call at 11 AM Eastern Time to discuss those results. We ask that you direct any questions on Envista's business performance through the Envista team. So, turning to our third quarter results. Sales grew 4% to $5 billion, with core revenue growth of 5% on a consolidated basis and 6% core revenue growth when excluding the results of our dental segment. Acquisitions increased revenues by 0.5%, while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%. Geographically, high-growth markets increased high-single digit, with China growing at that rate, while Russia and Eastern Europe both grew double-digits. Developed markets increase mid-single digits, with North America leading the way. Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.8%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit margin was 16.6%, with core operating margins increasing 70 basis points, led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. Now for the third quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 6%, with 6.5% core revenue growth. Operating profit margin increased by 60 basis points, with core operating margins expanding 100 basis points. At segment Life Sciences, we believe we continue to grow above the market as core revenue increased double-digits. We saw strength across most major geographies and product lines as new product introductions continued to contribute meaningfully to core revenue growth. In particular, we believe [indiscernible] cytometry with the CytoFLEX platform and dry reagents as these innovative product lines are simplifying customer workflows.  Additionally, Labcyte, the automated liquid handling business we acquired earlier this year, is growing double-digits and has exceeded our initial expectations. Core revenue at SCIEX declined slightly, in part due to a tough year-over-year comparison as the business grew nearly 10% in the third quarter last year. We saw strength in high-growth markets, and that was offset by softness in North America and Western Europe. At Pall, the team achieved high-single digit core revenue growth as we saw good performance in both the developed and the high-growth markets. The biotech and aerospace businesses saw the largest increases, offset by continued softness in microelectronics. August marked the fourth anniversary of our acquisition of Pall. Over the last four years, with the application of Danaher Business System, Pall has accelerated core revenue growth, expanded gross margins by greater than 500 basis points to approximately 55%, and increased operating margins nearly 1,000 basis points to above 25%. Implementing DBS tools has not only enhanced the financial performance, but also improved operational efficiency, expanded commercial capabilities and increased the cadence of innovation across the business. Turning to IDT. IDT delivered another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth with solid results across all major geographies. By product line, the business saw particular strength in next-generation sequencing and synthetic biology. In August, IDT continued to expand its product portfolio in the high-growth areas with the launch of a new product, oPools, the longest strands of ready-to-use DNA on the market. IDT's proprietary manufacturing process allows them to create DNA at the highest quality levels, enabling scientists focused on developing advanced diagnostic tests and treatments, to generate more consistent and reliable results in their research. Now moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenues increased 6.5%, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported and core operating profit margins increased by 100 basis points. DBS-led commercial and operational execution drove performance across the Diagnostics platform. Beckman Diagnostics had its fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit core revenue growth, driven by strength in high-growth markets and increases in North America. A key driver of Beckman's improved growth performance has been its increased cadence of new product introductions. At the American Association for Clinical Chemistry tradeshow in August, Beckman highlighted a number of these recent innovations, including the DxH 900 high-volume hematology analyzer, as well as the DxA 5000 laboratory automation systems. The DxH 900, with its early sepsis indicator, has been a key contributor in the improved performance in Beckman's hematology business. In automation, the DxA 5000, which was launched in Europe earlier this year, recently received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The system's key benefits of detecting pre-analytical sample quality, increasing turnaround time and reducing the number of manual processing steps from 32 to 4 are driving early adoption and great customer feedback.  Turning to Radiometer. Core revenue growth increased double-digits led by strong results in China and Japan as we believe the team drove market share gains in our blood gas and immunoassay product lines. Leica Biosystems also delivered double-digit core revenue growth, led by North American and Japan. Success at Leica is being driven by new product introductions combined with the implementation of growth rooms, one of our most impactful DBS commercial tools. Growth rooms enable cross functional teams to collaborate and align actions around the businesses' most critical short and long-term commercial initiatives.  With this focused approach, Leica's core histology and advanced staining product lines delivered mid-single digit core growth or better in each of the last eight quarters.  Finally, at Cepheid, core revenues increased double-digits across all major geographies and product lines. Next month will mark Cepheid's third anniversary with Danaher and we could not be more pleased with what the team has accomplished. Since acquisition,, the business has grown double-digits annually to nearly $1 billion in revenue. Gross margins have expanded by 1,000 basis points to approximately 50%. R&D investments have increased by over $50 million annually, while operating profit margins have increased from breakeven to approximately 20%. Cepheid highlights another powerful example of how running the Danaher playbook by applying DBS to drive growth and expand margins allows for investments back into the business that helps drive compounding returns. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenues increased 0.5%, with core revenue growth increasing at 2%. Operating profit margin remained constant, with core operating margins expanding 10 basis points. In Product Identification, core revenue declined slightly, driven in part by tough prior-year comparisons at Videojet, partially offset by growth in our packaging businesses. At VJ, core revenue declined low-single digits on a nearly 10% comparison to the third quarter last year. Despite the results of the quarter, we're encouraged by a positive order growth and expect improved performance in the fourth quarter. Last month, at the annual PACK EXPO tradeshow, Videojet showcased some of its recent instrument and digital innovations. On the instrument side, Videojet highlighted the VJ 7340 laser printer, featuring the smallest marking head available on the market today and allowing for easy integration into existing packaging lines. Videojet also released Rapid Recover, a digital solution that automatically troubleshoots and diagnoses printer service issues. This functionality builds on Videojet's market-leading service capabilities and improves customer uptime by increasing first-time fixed rates and avoiding costly investigation time. In our packaging businesses, which include Esko and X-Rite, core revenue increased at low-single digit rates, continuing the improving trends that we referenced in these businesses last quarter. Developed markets led the way, offsetting some softness in high-growth markets. Finally, at Water Quality, solid execution across the platform drove mid-single digit core revenue growth on top of a double-digit prior-year comparison.  So, looking at performance by operating company, Trojan core revenue increased double-digits led by North America. The team saw strong performance in the municipal market in both its UV and filtration product lines, driven by high win rates and service expansion initiatives. At Hach, core revenue increased low-single digits. Strong performance in Europe and North America was offset by declines in China due to a difficult comparison versus 2018 related to China's surface water initiative, Policy 61. At ChemTreat, core revenue increased mid-single digits, driven by strength in the oil and gas as well as the food and beverage end markets. In September, many of you attended our water quality platform investor day at Hach in Loveland, Colorado. On that day, we highlighted the key strategic initiatives of the platform. You also saw details on the sustainable business model that's common across Danaher, including strong underlying secular growth drivers, exceptional margin profiles and high recurring revenues.  The team provided examples throughout the day of customer-focused workflow solutions, innovation and go-to-market execution that we believe have led to share gains across Water Quality. Finally, the day showcased the variety of tools within the Danaher Business System to accelerate the cadence of innovation and drive sustainable long-term results across the platform. The presentation and webcast are available in the Investors section of our website and I encourage those who weren't able to attend the event to take a look. So, to wrap up. We're very pleased by our third quarter performance and the hard work the team has put in throughout the year. It's also worth highlighting the steps we've taken over the last several years to transform the portfolio. Through acquisitions, we brought in fundamentally higher growth businesses with significant consumables and aftermarket positions. Today, we consider 70% of our revenue to be recurring, with much of it being captive to our installed base and mission-critical to our customers' daily operations. Combined with our significant organic investments in innovation and outstanding team, the Danaher Business System, we're excited about the opportunity through the end of 2019 and beyond. So, we're initiating fourth-quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.35. We anticipate core revenue growth to be approximately 4.5% which excludes our Dental segment. We now expect full-year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.77. Both our fourth-quarter and full-year EPS guidance include the dilution from noncontrolling interest related to the 19.4% of Envista we no longer own. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Kathy, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Good morning, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Good morning. I'd like to start with the Diagnostics strength. You guys continue to put up great numbers there. Can you talk a little bit about how much of this is driven by the new hematology and automation launches? Can you comment on China? We've heard about some hospital issues there for Diagnostics. And here in the US, we did hear Quest the other day talk about vendor consolidation. Just curious how you think you're positioned as we go through that process with DxA 5000. Thanks. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure. Thanks, Tycho. A lot to cover there, starting with hematology. We've talked over the last several months, couple of quarters certainly, and most recently in my prepared remarks, about the impact of our new hematology product line. I think you probably know, Tycho, it's been in the works really since we acquired Beckman. That particular product line was a product line where we had some real challenges. And these new products, the DxH product line, particularly 900 with the early sepsis indicator, is making a significant difference. We have literally turned that business around from a business where we were not happy with our retention and our win rates to the point where now we're very happy with our retention and our win rates. And we're seeing growth in that business now that is having a material impact on the improved performance that you're now seeing from Beckman overall. Relative to the overall growth of Beckman, however, it's not purely a hematology story. Improvements in our menu across the board, across each of the analytical modalities, improvements in our automation systems \u2013 I noted the DxA 5000 which is also having impact, particularly in labs that are really challenged in terms of throughput and skilled labor where we're reducing the need for skilled labor. It's really all of those things combined that are having impact on seeing that consistent mid-single digit growth rate that Beckman is now improving towards. So, I think it's a combination of things. You asked specifically about China. We're seeing continued good performance in China. Beckman has always had a strong position in China. It's always been a key growth driver for us and it continues to be so. Clearly, it's is a highly competitive market, but we are extremely well-positioned there and continuing to see good growth, very high retention rates and very solid win rates as well. You asked about vendor consolidation. And if I caught your question accurately, I think the question was related to North America. And assuming I heard that accurately, clearly, there's always an effort across hospitals today to drive cost reductions. Vendor consolidation is certainly a part of that. But, again, as we look at our win rates and our retention rates across our North American business which is, obviously, an important part of the overall profile of Beck Dx, we continue to see both improved performance there and sustained improved performance. And again, that's underpinning that greater consistency of improvement, in fact, throughout the quarter. So, hopefully, I covered the water front. If I didn't, Tycho, happy to take a follow-up. Matt McGrew : Tycho, it's Matt. Tom mentioned Beckman in China, but just to give you some context on Diagnostics overall in China because that might have been part of the question as well. So, from a diagnostics perspective, in China, we were double digit core here in the quarter, just to give you some sense of the overall market over there. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then, one follow-up on Life Sciences, 6.5% core against a 9.5% comp. That certainly stands out. Just curious how you think about the sustainability of that? A lot of that, I guess, Pall up high-single digit as well. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure. Tycho, we feel very good about the sustainability of our performance across Life Science. If we step back and we think about kind of Pall side of the house versus Life Science tools, Life Science tools continue to be mid-single digit across the platform. Our underlying businesses like Molecular Devices, like Microsystems, both mid-single digit performance. And then, Beck LS, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, double-digit performance. So, on the tool side, really good performance. Obviously, a little bit more weakness in SCIEX, but we're very encouraged by the order trends that we see there. So, probably only one spot there that was maybe a little bit weaker. But, overall, I'd say the tool side very solid. And then, across the Pall business and what we would see is really the biopharma side of Pall, again, very good performance there. A solid market that we see continuing to perform well. Our biopharma exposure is now north of a $1.5 billion, most of that obviously coming from Pall Biotech. Pall Biotech saw double-digit core growth in the quarter. That's six quarters in a row of double-digit core growth. And the order trends look very good. We're also seeing good sustained performance across single-use technologies and gene and cell therapies, which are showing double-digit core growth. Admittedly, some of those are smaller portions of the overall portfolio, but really good performance. And we think those are sustainable positions over time, and building. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Lastly, could you give us the Pall industrial number? Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Pall industrial, on the quarter, was\u2026 Matt McGrew : Low-single digits, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Good morning. Hey, did I catch you correctly, the fourth quarter guidance is 4.5% core growth ex-Dental? Thomas Joyce, Jr.: That is correct. Derik De Bruin : All right. Can you sort of walk-through just sort of the market dynamics as we get there? I think that's a little bit lower than what we would've thought on it? I'm just sort of curious what you're sort of like assuming in terms of year-end spending and sort of unpack that, walking through those numbers. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure, of course. As you know, I think just stepping back a second, we've had eight quarters in a row of mid-single digit core growth. And we think the fourth quarter is a mid-single digit growth rate quarter as well. However, there are a couple of timing dynamics relative to our most recent \u2013 to our third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So, particularly in Diagnostics where we saw like a biosystems or radiometer at double-digit core growth rates in Q3, little help from the VIT [ph] impact in Japan, those businesses will moderate a little bit off of that double-digit core growth in Q3. And also, a couple of timing issues relative to the Life Science side where we had a big Q3, particularly for Pall, where they were some large equipment orders across biotech and the industrial side that moved from Q4 into Q3. So, really, we're talking about a little bit of timing impact there between Q3 and Q4, but we feel very good about our execution, very good about the underlying market dynamics across both Life Sciences and Diagnostics as well as across Water Quality and PID. And when you then look at our fourth quarter guidance in light of the full year, we're still talking about a full year of 2019 at 5.5% to 6%, and that's very consistent with what we talked about for the last couple of quarters. So, in general, we would characterize that fourth quarter, relative to the third, as likely more to do with timing, but still feel very good about where we'll bring in the full year. Derik De Bruin : Okay. That's helpful. And just out of curiosity, you talked a little bit about Western Europe and what's going on there, and specifically just wondering if some of the bioprocess strength you've seen or some of the stuff you've seen is potentially related to pull forwards in \u2013 because people are worried about Brexit and stuff. We've heard that from other companies recently that there may be some spending patterns that we've seen this year, can you talk about anything you're seeing in the European trends and sort of how that market is shaping up into the close? Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure. We are not seeing any sort of unusual procurement behavior in that regard in Western Europe. Europe, overall, across Q3 was performing at about a low-single digit rate. That's down a little bit clearly from the first half. We've seen a bit of softness in certain pockets, like at Videojet, a bit at SCIEX and a bit at like a Microsystems.  As we look at where those pockets of softness, I think they really speak to some of the overall macro softness in Europe because when we unpack where some of the differences are between the first half and the second half, it largely looks to be around instrumentation and equipment, some of the larger capital spend, some of the OEM customers, for example, in the packaging world, those are the areas where we some of that softness. So, I would attribute that low-single digit performance in Europe a little bit more to the macro softness in Europe than I would some \u2013 any unusual procurement behavior going on one way or the other. Derik De Bruin : And that's stuff that's not sort of have been into the research labs, it's more the industrial\u2026 Thomas Joyce, Jr.: That's right. Those are the areas that would speak a little bit more to the industrial side of the house. Admittedly, we're not \u2013 with our low percentage of the portfolio that's literally industrially exposed, we're not a terrific proxy, but we can certainly see a few of those pockets, whether it's in North America or in developed Europe where some of that macro slowdown exists. But again those are pretty small pockets. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. VijayKumar: Thanks for taking the question, guys. And congrats on a nice print here. So, Tom, maybe one big picture question for you to start off with. On a pro forma basis, when you look at the assets, some of the comments you made on DBS and how underlying growth for acquired business have improved, if I just look at the numbers, the core Danaher is, call it, a mid singles core. Ex-Dental, that helps your core. And now GE comes in with DBS, this seems to be a solid mid singles. And even if macro were to soften going forward, it seems like that mid-single digit, that stable, strong, mid-single digit piece that should be pretty much intact. So, I'm just curious on that pro forma growth outlook on how you guys are looking at it? Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Well, Vijay, first of all, I think your summary of the portfolio today is an accurate one. We've made tremendous progress in the evolution of the portfolio towards establishing that mid-single digit growth performance. And I think we've done that with businesses that have demonstrated, over time and over cycles, their stability in driving that consistent kind of growth performance. Now, some of that comes from being in terrific markets with leading positions in those markets, but it also comes from the nature of the balance of sale whereby, as I mentioned earlier, with 70% of our revenue roughly being recurring revenue, largely in the form of consumables that are captive to the instrumentation and with the addition of service and other associated aftermarket, the combination of being in great markets with leading businesses and that strong aftermarket consumables position is what gives us confidence that we built a portfolio that is designed to be sustainable over macro cycles. Now, that doesn't mean that we are completely immune, as I just mentioned about a couple of soft spots here and there that could be geographic or could be where we have a little bit of exposure to a more industrial-oriented market. But in general, we've built a portfolio to that effect. And, yes, the addition of the GE Biopharma business is but one more significant step in reinforcing that kind of market position. So, we feel very good about that looking forward into 2020 and beyond. VijayKumar: That's helpful, Tom. And, Matt, one quick one for you on this fourth quarter guidance. It looks like the guide implies a solid market expansion in Q4. One, am I right in my math on that solid margin expansion and maybe comment on where this is coming from, OpEx versus IGM? Matt McGrew : Yeah, it's probably going to be a little bit of both on the gross margin side and the OpEx. But the way that I kind of think about \u2013 I think you're right, Vijay. I think the way that we kind of think about the Q4 guide, especially with some of the noise in there with the NCI and the FX, we're kind of talking about 4.5% core growth, kind of a normal solid 35% fall through. And really, that NCI headwind of call it a couple of pennies is really the only change here that we've sort of made to the guide, if you will. But, yeah, I think you're right, we anticipate having pretty good fall through like we normally would expect here in the fourth quarter. I suspect it will be a little bit on the gross margin side and probably with that comes the operating leverage as well. VijayKumar: Thanks, guys. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Hi, Scott. How you're doing? Scott Davis : Great. It's easy covering your company. Every quarter, you put up decent numbers and not exactly sure what you make and what you sell, but it's working. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Scott, you know we love to make life easy for all of the visitors on this call. One of our goals, among many. Scott Davis : I don't know if I might be the last industrial guy left, but you're not going to get rid of me that easily. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: That's okay. Welcome back. What's up today? Scott Davis : So, I've got two questions for you, Tom. The first is just the asset sales. Maybe a little bit of color around how this \u2013 was this a compromise with the regulators, was this something the regulators requested, was it US regulators or was it more globally geared? Just a little bit more color on that. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure, Scott. Well, when we initially announced this deal, we did it with the clear understanding that regulators were going to do what obviously they would do in a deal of this magnitude, and that that would be done across the span of regulatory bodies from the US to Europe, other countries and certainly to China. And so, eyes wide open that those reviews would take place and that there was always a prospect that there could be a small portion of the GE portfolio or the Danaher Life Science portfolio that the regulators may have questions about. And so, the sale of the businesses that we announced earlier this week to Sartorius was really a function of what we believe were very constructive discussions with regulatory bodies across the world and with a clear understanding of what the rationales were from their perspective as well as ours, and this is simply something that regulatory bodies along with us came to the point where we thought \u2013 where both parties thought that this made sense. And so, it really was a series of globally-oriented conversations and made sense to take that step. Scott Davis : ,: Matt McGrew : Yeah, Scott. It's Matt. So, I think if you kind of look back at maybe the two core metrics, if you will, that we sort of talk about with deals, if you think about core growth at Pall, so when we kind of bought Pall, I would say it was more of a low-single digit core growth business, in that over the course of, let's say, last, I guess \u2013 like you said, four years here, the team has done a really good job at kind of taking DBS \u2013 in particular, DBS on the growth side and the innovation side and really changing that fundamentally to be more of a mid-single digit plus type growth rate. So, I think you've seen a significant progress on the top line. As far as kind of OP goes, I think when that business came in, it was kind of a high teens type of OP. Today, we sort of own that business at, call it, a 1000 basis points better than that. So, we've made really good progress on kind of the team coming in there and taking out some of the costs that we knew were there. I think, if you remember, we talked about kind of a cost target at the initial that was kind of $300 million. I think we took that up even to $350 million ultimately. So, from an ROIC perspective, I think that so far as we stand here, I would stay that that exceeds where we thought we would be. Scott Davis : Okay. Well, congratulations on that. Thank you, guys. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Hey, Doug. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good morning, guys. So, I guess, first a question on interest rates. So, the interest rate on the Eurobond was under 1%. Recognizing you still need to issue the rest of the debt and probably a good chance it's going to come in at a rate that is at least slightly higher than the Eurobond, it still seems like you're going to have some upside relative to the deal model you shared with the investment community originally. So, by our math, every 50 basis points of lower interest rate translates into about $0.10 of earnings upside. Does that seem reasonable and should we expect you to let this flow through or is there likely to be some reinvestment? Matt McGrew : Yeah. I think the numbers that you're quoting on the Eurobond are accurate, obviously. I don't think \u2013 and we do still need to do the US deal here. And like you said, I suspect that will probably be at a higher rate, but we will get to that in the fourth quarter. I think as far as kind of trying to think through the deal model, I think I would say, at this point, we are not trying to update, if you will, kind of the GE accretion. We're, obviously, going to have some moving pieces here. You're going to have a little bit of a headwind, though modest, from the divestitures that we just announced on Monday. Obviously, just talked about likely some favorable financing costs so far on the Eurobond deal. Also, likely to have a business in the GE Biopharma business that when it \u2013 it's had a pretty good year here in 2019. So, I think the way to think about it is we will kind of holistically pull all of that together for you when we do update the guide, so that we can kind of incorporate all of that at one time. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thank you for that. And very quick follow-up related to the deal as well and following up on the last question on divestitures. Based on where you are in the regulatory process and the fact that you did announce those divestitures earlier this week, how would you characterize the probability that additional divestitures could be required from here on out? Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Well, Doug, as you saw in the announcement \u2013 first of all, those divestitures are pretty modest on a relative basis at $140 million. So, less than 5% of the revenues that we are going to acquire. But, of course, the regulatory process is a fluid one. So, while we believe this was a significant \u2013 a major step towards approval, at this point, we can't comment on this any further. It was an important milestone. But as we commented, we don't expect either this deal to close, nor the actual formality of those approvals to be completed until the first quarter and, therefore, closing immediately following that. We can't comment any further about any prospects for any further actions. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Totally understood. Maybe just a couple on the quarter. First, on Diagnostics, core margin expanded 100 basis points and was ahead of our forecast. Could you talk through some detail on that performance? And specifically, I'd be curious how Cepheid margins are progressing and how growth improvement at Beckman is really contributing to this performance? And then, just on Pall, it seems like the bioprocessing market is growing broadly at a very strong 15-plus percent rate based on what some of your peers have reported over the last few days. I think you noted that Pall Biotech grew double digits. Is it reasonable to believe that you're growing Pall Biotech at least at that 15% plus level that we're hearing from others? Thank you. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Doug, I'll take the Biopharma piece first and Matt will jump back in on the Dx margins. Yes, the simple answer is, what you are hearing from other sources around the growth in the bioprocessing market overall as being a double-digit growth rate market and a very attractive one, and one by the way that we and obviously others believe is sustainable in terms of its growth prospects, we at Pall are clearly benefiting from that and taking advantage of that opportunity to drive that kind of growth. We did put up double-digit growth within that business, and that's across obviously our filtration business, which is fundamental to biologic drug production, but also includes growth in the really innovative ends of the spectrum around Biopharma which is really around single use technologies which are becoming increasingly important as biological drugs are being produced in smaller and smaller batch sizes for unique patient populations, as well as in the growth areas around cell and gene therapy, which while being somewhat nascent today are going to be significant growth drivers in the future and we are participating in that growth today with outstanding products and I think a series of new products that will be coming over time that we're very excited about. Matt McGrew : Yeah, Doug. As far as the Dx margins go, in particular in the quarter, I think we had a pretty good performance generally speaking out of all of the businesses, but I would call out both like a biosystems and radiometer. Those are some of our higher margin businesses and, obviously, both of those growing sort of in the double-digit core growth. Certainly helps the margin performance. But, overall, I think it was pretty good with a little bit of a boost here from those businesses that had been kind of sort of high-single digits here year-to-date, turning in kind of a low-double digit performance in the quarter. So, I think that's a big ramp of it. As far as Cepheid's margins go, again, it's sort of similar to the Pall story. I think the team there has done a fantastic job of really balancing growth, while also focusing on the margin side of it. And they've done a really nice job of kind of embracing DBS and leading from the front. And today, I think when we bought it, it was sort of a \u2013 maybe a breakeven type business from an OP perspective. And today, those margins are, call it, 20% or so from an EBITA [ph] perspective. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thanks, Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Steve Beuchaw : Hi. Good morning and thanks. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Good morning Steve Beuchaw : I had just a couple for Tom and then one for Matt. Tom, I wonder if you wouldn't mind unpacking the number at SCIEX a little bit. I'd say prospectively, you mentioned that you saw some really good trends on orders. It would be helpful to know a little bit more about what you're seeing. And then, for the quarter, SCIEX is a little bit unique relative to some tools businesses, in that you have a clinical exposure. It would be nice to hear how you saw the relative trends in that business between clinical, some of the core applied markets where you have a good presence. And then, to the extent you have any comment on what you're seeing on pharma on the R&D, that would be really helpful. Second question is just more of a global question on municipal and broader government project demand. You're uniquely well positioned to have a view on how that's tracking.  And then, I'll go ahead and, Matt, ask you just one. And more of a prospective, big picture question. You have a lot of moving parts in the model given that we're divesting Dental and we have GE coming into the fray, looking for the majority of 2020. Can you just talk prospectively about the impact on earnings and cash to the extent you can, associated with those transitions? If you can give us any update on the thinking, so we know how and maybe some of it's below the line to think about those items going forward. Really appreciate the help here. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure, Steve. Thanks. So, let's start with SCIEX. You heard my comment accurately that while SCIEX was down slightly in the quarter, we are, in fact, encouraged by the order trends that we're seeing and we do in fact expect some improved performance in the fourth quarter. When we look at the quarter itself, third quarter, we clearly were up against a tough comp. SCIEX, so I think I mentioned was up nearly 10% in the third quarter of last year. So, certainly, a bit of a challenge from a comp standpoint. But we did see some \u2013 outside of that, some softness in North America. A little bit of that was timing of some larger deals in the second half between Q3 and Q4, but also \u2013 and this does get a little bit into some of the market segments that you asked about. We are seeing the consolidation of some small and midsize reference labs, and that has created a bit of a headwind there.  You asked about specifically the clinical market, and SCIEX has certainly had a position in clinical over time, but over the last couple of years, we've seen a number of challenges in that market that are not unique to SCIEX. Just broadly defined challenges around changes in reimbursement and guidelines around pain management, for one example. And, certainly, the impact both across small and midsize labs are related to those challenges in clinical. So, SCIEX was really built on the back of tremendous strength and depth of technologies and capabilities around pharma. Small molecule certainly originally and more recently around large molecule positions. And those positions continue to be reasonably good, particularly biopharma which, obviously, is a growth segment. Core small molecule pharma was much more modest in its growth globally. Academic was actually \u2013 remain pretty good really across North America and China. And I think, overall, we think SCIEX is going to continue to be a leader in that market, a real innovator and one where, over time, we'll see a pickup after third quarter. You asked about the municipal market. And our exposure to the municipal market or the government market is, for the most part, associated with our Water Quality platform. And in that case, the term municipal is probably more appropriate to our position really than any broader governmental construct, at least in the US. And what we've seen most recently in the US and in Europe would be that municipal spending has generally been pretty consistent. And that's what's driven the mid-single digit growth rates that we put up at Water Quality across the US and Western Europe. And that applies certainly to Hach, it applies to Trojan and a bit to ChemTreat, although ChemTreat tends to be more associated with applied markets. In China, where we continue to see good performance for our Water Quality platform, albeit against a very tough comp associated with what's called Policy 61, which we noted in the prepared remarks, that market is continuing to be an outstanding market. And, yes, it is largely associated with government or, in particular, environmental ministry oriented regulations, such as Policy 61 which drove an increased level of monitoring in surface waters across China last year. That will continue to be a positive dynamic across water quality. So, right now, we see pretty consistent and steady performance around both municipal spending in the developed markets as well as a little bit more governmental orientated attention to environmental issues in the high growth markets. Matt McGrew : And, Steve, as far your kind of \u2013 your question on the moving pieces with GE and Dental, I think maybe the way I think about it is sort of that, from an EPS perspective, obviously, Q4, there's no GE impact. And we talked a little bit here earlier about all the moving pieces that are there and, obviously, as we get a little closer to close, we will update all of that for 2020. But as far as Q4, obviously, nothing to think about. As far as Q4 goes for EPS for Envista, the NCI, I kind of put a placeholder of maybe $0.02 in there for the NCI for the fourth quarter. And then, as far as kind of cash flow goes, I think that was your next question. If you think about, we sort of talked about GE coming in at maybe roughly $1 billion worth of cash flow and Envista will kind of be out there, I think, talking to you guys about their own 2020 cash flow projections when they get a little closer. So, I don't want to kind of speak for them, but I think you can kind of pencil in that GE have call it a billion and we'll let Envista talk about 2020 cash flow when they talk to you guys later today. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Great details. Really appreciate the time here. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Dan Brennan : Thank you. Great. So, maybe a question just on Q3, Q4. Tom, I think you mentioned a few times, maybe a little bit of timing benefit or timing push out. And, obviously, with the size of Danaher, I'm sure there's always lots of small shifts. But just wanted to understand, was there a more pronounced timing benefit this quarter? And maybe could you just help us then think about \u2013 implicit in your fourth quarter guide, how do we think about kind of Life Science, Diagnostics and kind of EAS? Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure, Dan. Yeah, I think perhaps a little bit of timing issue between Q3 and Q4 here and the margin would have been a little bit more pronounced than what we've seen. But I think if you look at the fundamentals underneath each one of the platforms, Life Science, Diagnostics and EAS, each one of them continued to perform quite well. Again, our exposure to the macro environment is somewhat limited in the sense of being a good proxy for an industrial slowdown. We don't have a lot of industrial exposure left. And so, we generally feel very good about how the overall platform will perform going through the fourth quarter and how we're set up for 2020. Dan Brennan : Okay. Great. And then, you kind of touched upon my kind of second part of the question. Maybe could you help us think about, like maybe between your 70% recurring business on instrument side of the house, were there \u2013 you mentioned earlier in the call that there's a bit of pressure there from what you're seeing globally. It's a question we get a lot, like differentiating between Danaher and other players in the broader tool spaces, the global economy is getting softer. So, how do we think about kind of your instrument kind of growth rate kind of as we look out here with PMIs being a bit weak and the global economy slowing? Thanks, Tom. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure. Here's one sort of way to think about it, Dan, using some specific numbers. If you look at the third quarter, our consumables business was up, call it, 6% versus the equipment side of the house, which is up more like 4%. And so, if you think back to the last couple of quarters, those have been closer to even \u2013 about equal equipment versus consumables. Here you see the consumables number continuing to be quite strong and the equipment number being a little bit softer. And I think that's probably the best way to look at what is underneath some of the softness that I talked about that may be impacted by the macro environment across a business like Videojet, for example, or SCIEX or possibly like a Microsystems, probably to name three examples of businesses where the equipment side of the house is a higher percentage of the balance of sale than on average across the portfolio. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you. Thomas Joyce, Jr.: You bet. Operator : We have reached the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Gugino for closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Kathy. And thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're around all day for questions.

With that I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher. For the full year, we delivered 6% core revenue growth as we continued to capture market share in many of our businesses through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution. We also delivered 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and $3 billion of free cash flow. But the numbers only tell part of Danaher's transformative story in 2019. We continued to evolve into a higher growth company as we announced the GE Biopharma acquisition and completed the IPO and subsequent split-off of our dental segment into an independent publicly traded company called Envista. GE Biopharma, which will be called Cytiva after we close had a very good 2019 as core revenue growth of approximately 10% accelerated relative to the businesses performance over the past couple of years. We continue to be very impressed with this talented team an extraordinary group of passionate and highly engaged associates who provide customers with innovative solutions used in the development and production of biopharmaceutical drugs. During the fourth quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the acquisition which we continue to expect to close in the first quarter of this year. First, as part of the regulatory approval process we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain of our businesses to Sartorius. The annual revenue to be divested is approximately $170 million and consists of businesses that are currently part of our Life Science platform. Secondly, we received conditional clearance for the acquisition from the European Commission in December. While the timing around meeting certain closing conditions can be uncertain, we continue to work constructively with the regulators and remain encouraged by the progress we're making. And lastly, we raised approximately $4 billion of U.S. denominated debt in October, which essentially completes the financing needed to fund the acquisition. Overall, financing costs have come in materially better than expected, as we were able to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions, particularly in Europe. When we announced the transaction last year, we anticipated financing $18 billion of debt and cash at a blended interest rate of approximately 2.75%, resulting in a total annual interest cost of $500 million. The actual blended interest rate on this $18 billion will be less than 1% for a total annual interest cost of $150 million. As a result, we now believe GE Biopharma will be approximately $0.60 accretive to non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2020. This assumes an end of first quarter close and includes the impact of the lower financing cost and the business is better than 2019 core revenue growth, partially offset by the lost earnings related to the pending divestitures. While not included in our formal 2020 guidance, we wanted to provide you with an update given these recent developments. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Sales grew 5.5% to $4.9 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by approximately 1%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 50 basis points. Core revenue increased 6%. Geographically, high-growth markets increased at a high single-digit rate, led by China and India. In the developed markets, the U.S. remains strong, delivering high single-digit growth, while Western Europe was up mid-single digits. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.5% and operating profit margin was 19.8%. Core operating margin increased 175 basis points in the quarter, bringing full year core operating margin expansion to 100 basis points, a testament to the team's terrific execution across the portfolio. The Danaher Business System continues to be the primary driver of our strong core operating margin performance and 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year that we expanded core operating margins by 70 basis points or more. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.28 were up double digits year-on-year, bringing full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share to $4.42. All in all, a strong finish to a very important year. So, now let's take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 7% and core revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter. Operating profit margin of 21.2% was up 150 basis points with 190 basis points of core margin expansion. For the full year, life sciences achieved 7% core revenue growth and delivered operating margin expansion of 145 basis points. Core growth at Beckman Life Sciences was up mid-single digits with strength across most major geographies and product lines. This finished off another great year for Beckman as the business grew high single digits and surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. New product introductions have been a key driver in Beckman's success and contributed more than 250 basis points to core growth each of the last two years. SCIEX core revenue was up low single digits versus the high single-digit prior year comparison. Performance improved sequentially, with particular strength in the pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. Geographically, core growth in the quarter was led by North America and Asia, which was particularly offset -- which was partially offset by softness in China. At Pall, the team achieved its second straight year of high single-digit core revenue growth, with nearly 10% core growth in the fourth quarter. Strong momentum in our biotech and aerospace businesses was partially offset by expected weakness in microelectronics. IDT achieved double-digit core revenue growth, led by synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing product line, where newly launched products are gaining market share. Since joining Danaher in 2018, the IDT team has embraced the Danaher Business System and made excellent progress, both operationally and commercially. Using DBS growth tools, they've enabled cross-functional teams to collaborate more effectively during the product development process, to improve quality and reduce time to market. With this more focused approach to innovation, IDT has increased their cadence of new product launches and expanded their best-in-class offering to further customers' research across a number of genomic application. Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 7% in the quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported operating profit margin was 19.5%, with reported and core operating margins up 70 basis points. Over the last few years, we've made significant strategic investments, both organically and inorganically, to better position our Diagnostics platform and oriented towards higher growth opportunities. We're seeing the impact of these initiatives, as the Diagnostics team delivered 7% core revenue growth in 2019, a continuation of the market share gains we've achieved over the last few years. Turning to Beckman Diagnostics. While core revenue was up only low single digits in the quarter on a difficult prior year comparison, 2019 was a great year for Beckman, as the team achieved mid single-digit core revenue growth, their best annual core growth rate since we acquired the business in 2011. China continued to perform well and positive results across all major product lines were led by double-digit growth in automation. We've improved Beckman's growth trajectory over the last few years by focusing on impactful new product development and improved commercial execution. Our launch of the DxH series of new hematology analyzers has been a key contributor to improvement in core revenue growth. And on the commercial side, our North American sales team's effective implementation of DBS growth rooms has helped drive double-digit gains in our customer retention rate. Radiometer achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out their 15th consecutive year of mid-single-digit or better core growth, a remarkable achievement. Results were strong across both the developed and high-growth markets, as we believe Radiometer continued to gain share relative to the market. At Leica Biosystems, double-digit core revenue growth was driven by positive results across all major geographies and product lines. In addition to continued strength in core histology and advanced staining, pathology imaging also had a strong quarter, driven by demand for new products, like the Aperio GT 450. The GT 450 is a new automated high-capacity digital pathology slide scanner that enables extensive biopsy databases to be digitized, making them more accessible for researchers around the world. Core revenue at Cepheid was up more than 20% for the quarter, with broad-based strength across all major geographies, led by North America and Western Europe. The business surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue in December and we couldn't be happier for the team to hit this major growth milestone. Since the 2016 acquisition, core revenue has compounded annually at a rate of approximately 20%. The team has done a terrific job incorporating DBS commercial tools and processes, to enhance their go-to-market strategy as well. With an installed base of more than 20,000 instruments and the largest molecular test menu available on the market today, Cepheid is poised to continue taking share in this highly attractive fast-growing space. Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 2% with 2.5% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin increased to 25.3% with 265 basis points of core margin expansion. In product identification, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate. At Videojet, core revenue was up low-single-digits but performance accelerated sequentially. Strength in North America and Western Europe was partially offset by softness in the high-growth markets. By end market, consumer products and food and beverage led the way. Our packaging businesses, which includes Esko and X-Rite was up mid-single digits. We had a particularly good quarter at Esko where growth rate was led by demand for our brand owner software, including BLUE, a business we acquired 18 months ago. BLUE provides label and artwork management software that enhances Esko's offering in the packaging development and production workflow. As a result, the Esko team is helping customers reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market while improving cost and quality across their packaging value chain. Finally turning to water quality, core revenue for the quarter increased at a low-single-digit rate. Core revenue at Hach increased low-single-digits. However, the fourth quarter represented the last period of tough prior year comparisons driven by China's surface water monitoring regulation Policy 61. Excluding the Policy 61 impact, Hach's core revenue increased mid-single-digits for the quarter and full year. Hach has been a consistent mid-single-digit growth business throughout its 20-year tenure as a Danaher operating company. And this success has been largely driven by the team's commitment to solving challenging customer problems through innovative applications and workflow solutions. One example is the recently launched CL17 FC, Hach's new online chlorine analyzer, which is easy to use and is equipped with Claros, Hach's water intelligence software. This combination of innovative hardware and software solutions helps customers more effectively manage their connected instruments, their processes and data ultimately lowering their operating costs, increasing compliance and reducing risk. At Trojan core revenue declined in the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects, but the team delivered impressive double-digit core growth for the full year. Trojan's growth acceleration in 2019 was driven by a combination of recent new product launches and commercial initiatives focused on expanding field service capabilities. And lastly, core revenue at ChemTreat was up mid-single digits with particular strength in the chemical and food and beverage end markets. So to wrap up, 2019 was an outstanding year for Danaher and marked our 35th anniversary as a company. Over the course of that time, through a combination of organic and inorganic initiatives, we've transformed into a higher-growth higher-margin and higher recurring revenue company. With a resilient portfolio that's built for the future and the Danaher Business System as our consistent driving force, we feel well positioned to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.06 to $1.09. This assumes core revenue growth of 6% to 6.5%, and reflects the impact of three additional selling days versus the first quarter last year. We're also initiating full year 2020 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.80 to $4.90, which implies double-digit growth year-over-year at the midpoint and as mentioned earlier does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of GE Biopharma. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Christel, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Matt Gugino : Good morning, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Good morning. I'll start with Pall. For life sciences, you had previously baked in a slowdown for the fourth quarter. Obviously that didn't happen. So just curious, if you could talk a little bit about why you thought things might slow why they did not and I guess what's embedded in the guide for Pall Life Sciences going forward? And as we think about kind of capacity supply-demand dynamics and adding GE Biopharma into the portfolio, how are you feeling about the sustainability of the platform of business? Tom Joyce : Thanks, Tycho. We're really, really very pleased with how Pall performed in the quarter double-digit core growth in the quarter that, I've mentioned was led by biotech and aerospace. And if you sort of break that down and go in specifically into the life science side of Pall, you have double-digit core growth in life sciences. We've talked in the past about single use technologies that certainly was a portion of that growth. Single-use continues to grow at better than 20%. And so I think the combination of just looking at life sciences overall breaking it down into biotech and then looking specifically at that high-growth area of SUT all combined to give us a tremendous amount of confidence both in terms of Pall's positioning in that market, but also the end market strength. And so I think we feel very good about that. Now, we try to be prudent here early in the year in terms of how we embed different segments of the business into our overall guide. And so I think we sort of look into 2020 and think about the overall biopharma market and our position there is perhaps a little bit more normalized at high single digits in 2020. But overall that's not to suggest that we think this is about a market slowdown or there's any overcapacity issues. It's really about just saying that, hey, this 2019 was a great year. We're probably a little prudent going into the \u2013 into 2020, but this is absolutely a fantastic market to be a part of. We don't really see any issues relative to what \u2013 as we've been asked about in terms of overcapacity in the market. We continue to track the volumes of individual drugs that are being produced, and that really is the indicator. And we continue to see just tremendous progress both in terms of the drug development pipeline and the volume ramps of individual biopharmaceuticals where essentially we are integrated into the process. Relative to GE Biopharma that obviously improves our position in the overall market. It gives us broader exposure, specifically to the biopharmaceutical market, large molecules and those more advanced technologies given GE's exceptional position in chromatography. And so we're looking forward to closing that transaction here in the first quarter. And we think, it will be just a tremendous addition to the overall portfolio albeit as a separate standalone operating company distinct from Pall. Matt McGrew : Hey, Tycho this is Matt. Just to kind of clarify. From a planning assumption perspective for biopharma for this year we're kind of thinking low double digits versus the mid-teens that we saw sort of last year. So just kind of clarify, where we think that will be here. Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's helpful. And then one follow-up on China up high single digits, can you maybe just talk about what's embedded in guidance for China? And then obviously with coronavirus just curious how you're thinking about that as it relates to particularly for your diagnostics business over there. Tom Joyce : Sure. It was overall a very good quarter in China Tycho up high single digits in the fourth quarter and that was across all four of the platforms. And we saw high single digits in Dx and that was broad based in terms of the strength that we saw. Within life science, you know, as well as we do there's some policy and regulatory noise around the food and to some extent, the pharma market around four by seven that had some impact on SCIEX. But generally, we expect continued good performance from both of those platforms and both of those markets. Even PID was up high single digits and that was largely Esko and Videojet. And in water quality, I think I commented on ex Policy 61 terrific. So I think as we look forward in China, we see continued good growth opportunities there. Specific to the coronavirus situation. Obviously, it's a very challenging situation to get a clear handle on in terms of what its overall impact is. We have not seen any specific impact to this point on our business. That was before everyone left for the New Year. And as you know, certain provinces are extending, the Chinese New Year at this point. And that's obviously a little bit of a wildcard here in the first quarter. So, losing potentially an extra week could have an impact on both sales and the supply chain. But given that it's early in the quarter, we'll be working to offset that certainly, here in the first quarter. And could see some impact moving to second, but we continue to work to offset. So, we haven't incorporated any of that into any guidance. But it's just too early to tell. We're hoping for the best. We have businesses by the way Tycho that are actively involved in taking on this challenge. Both Cepheid and IDT are engaged in -- with outside parties on a global basis both public and private, including the CDC to support their efforts -- particularly at CDC supporting the CDC efforts around releasing just in the last couple of days, a panel of two PCR probes and primers that are designed specifically to detect the virus. So, we are in the fight here, but the impact of this both in terms of the overall Chinese market, our business. And any of our specific businesses it's just far too early to tell. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Tom Joyce : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Tom Joyce : Hi Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hi. Tom Joyce : Hey. Good morning. Derik De Bruin : Hey, Could you sort of talk about the embedded margin assumptions for the business ex-GE right now as sort of what's embedded in the guide? Just sort of want to walk through now that dental is out what you're sort of thinking about the margin expansion and gross margin expansion would be in 2020. Matt McGrew : Yeah. So kind of embedded \u2013 Derik, its Matt, kind of embedded in our guide here is sort of a 5% core growth which we talked about. And kind of -- the typical 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion on that is sort of how we get to the range $4.80 to $4.90. Derik De Bruin : Great and the -- when GE comes into that, I mean it's going to -- obviously the margins are higher than that. Would you expect incremental boost to that immediately? I'm just sort of thinking about, sort of how it rolls through. Matt McGrew : Well, I mean, it's going to roll through. And we talked about the initial accretion and kind of what we updated here today. So, that would have obviously included the fact that that is a higher-margin business than what we have. So, I think the way to think about that rolling through is it is in that $0.60. And then, as we go forward, we sort of talked about that as this being -- even though it's high-margin business. I don't think it's going to have much of an impact on our 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion every year. Higher-margin businesses tend to, kind of not necessarily have the best margin expansion, at the highest highs then given the VCM and the fall-through they already have. So, I still think going forward using 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion, even post-GE is the right way to think about it. And you'll capture the uplift in the margin, in that $0.60 if you will in 2020. Derik De Bruin : Great, and just a quick follow-up to Tycho's question on, the China situation, have you embedded anything into your organic core growth guide for any sort of slowdown in the market at all? Matt McGrew : At this point, we have not. We kind of -- as Tom said, it's -- we know as much as you guys know and we've sort of kind of -- if everything gets back to normal very quickly here it's still early enough that. We think we'd probably be able to offset that largely. So too early to tell and we have not put anything into either Q1, or the full year at this point. Derik De Bruin : Great, thanks, I will get back in a queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys. Congrats on a nice print here. Thanks for taking the question, Tom, maybe one big picture question on the Biopharma, I think, the commentary on the assumptions around 2020 growth low-double digits that was helpful. In GE, that business has been running double digits in 2019. So I'm just curious your thoughts around the growth of the GE Biopharma assets. And not -- why 6% to 7% is still the right way to think about the outlook for that business? Tom Joyce : Hey, thanks Vijay. I appreciate the question. You're right. We had an initial planning assumption of 6% to 7% for that business. As I mentioned, in my remarks, they performed better than that, here in 2019. We just need to get the business closed and we need to get in underneath the covers and really understand at a deeper level kind of the order rate trajectory ,the backlog and those kind of things to make sure that we're comfortable as we go through 2020 at rates higher than our original projection. So we're excited about getting inside and getting with the team and trying to understand those opportunities. Obviously, if we were closed in the business a year ago and had this visibility that we would normally get to 2019, we would have had a higher view, but we'll need a little time to get inside and see what 2020 ultimately might look like. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Tom. And, Matt, one quick on the guidance. Margin execution shown in Q4 really strong. Was this because core revenues came in better with this volume-related leverage, or -- I'm just curious on what drove margin execution. And when you think about the context of three extra days in Q1, any assumptions on what the contribution is to the top line in Q1 from extra days? Thank you. Matt McGrew : Sure. Maybe start with the second question first. So from -- I think, the three extra days in Q1 is probably worth -- it's sort of hard to tell. Its inexact science, but I think it's probably 50 to 100 basis points in Q1, would be probably what its worth. And then, kind of, talking to the Q4 fall through, I mean, gross margins were up 50 bps year-over-year, which was helpful. Price was okay here in the quarter. And the rest was good. It was kind of running the Danaher playbook. SG&A was down. Gross margins are up. And the volume coming through at 6% was a little bit better than we thought and that led to a pretty good finish here to the year with 100 basis points of margin expansion. And I think that's probably the way to think about it. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Tom Joyce : Hi, Doug. Doug Schenkel : Hey, guys. Good morning. Tom Joyce : Good morning. Doug Schenkel : How does the favorable financing outcome -- we knew about, but you described very well in your prepared remarks, how does that impact your flexibility on capital deployment? Specifically, I'm really thinking about M&A, maybe more near-term than we might have thought a quarter or two ago. And related to that, based on your forecasts for free cash flow this year, it appears you can delever to about 3.5 times EBITDA by the end of 2020. Am I doing math the right way there? Matt McGrew : I mean, it's going to be close to that, I suppose, have -- I mean, yes, I think that's probably a pretty good spot. As far -- I'm sorry, that's on the second question, the free cash flow. As far as any impact, I think, on your first question, does that change in a material way, the interest -- would change in a material way in the near term, I don't think it's going to have a big difference on what we -- how we think about M&A here in the near term. I think we've talked about, we're still going to be active and in the market for sure. We will probably be focusing more on some of the bolt-on activity in smaller deals. But also, like we've said, if something was of interest and strategically out there for us. We also have talked in the past that, if we had to issue equity, we would. So, I don't think the financing necessarily changes anything in the near-term here. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thank you for that. In your prepared remarks as well as in the press release, you called out market share gains as a driver of revenue growth. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe be a bit more specific on where this most -- this is most evident, based on what you're seeing recently. And how we should think about the sustainability of these share gains moving forward? Tom Joyce : Sure. Absolutely. I'd be happy to, Doug. I'll pick a couple of examples, looking across the portfolio. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some terrific performance at Beckman Life Science. So to give you an example of what's driving the share gains there, if you look at our -- the cadence of new products, we've introduced over 20 new products in the last three years at Beck LS. In the three years pre-acquisition, that business launched three new products. So we've 7x the cadence of new product introductions. And specifically those are going into higher growth applications like biologics and genomics, obviously, our CytoFLEX product line in flow cytometry and the reagents associated with that, the new automation products and the Biomek series that I've talked about, the Vi-CELL products in particle counting, all those things are really contributing from a new product innovation standpoint to share gains at Beck LS and that's why we're seeing that meaningful step-up in growth at Beck LS, which by the way was virtually a flat growth business when we acquired it. You know, if I look over at -- in the diagnostics -- a couple of businesses that again are clearly gaining share. You got to look at Cepheid as one really good example and menu expansion continues to be a part of that certainly the menu expansion in flu and strep, but really good commercial execution. Expansion into IDNs our integrated delivery networks has made a big difference. I think if you look at that installed base that we've now grown from 13,000 systems at acquisition to 23,000 in the installed base over 40 major health systems that have been converted, 11 new assays and three point-of-care systems. I mean these are the things that I think underpin our confidence and our belief in the share gains at a place like Cepheid. If I look at a business that has been with us certainly a lot longer, but where the performance continues to be terrific I talked about the 15th consecutive year of good performance at Radiometer and their share gains. We've seen a 50% increase in blood gas competitive takeaways in 2019 alone. So we track every competitive situation and we can be clear about where we have in fact displaced a competitive instrument. So I think good examples there. One last one maybe I'll turn over to water quality where Hach has really improved their new product cadence. A lot of terrific products beyond the CL17 that I talked about in my prepared remarks, but a part of what's driven their cadence is they have cut their new product development time by 50% in the last two years. And at the same time, they've driven ideation and improved the nature of what's in the funnel I think substantially. And so again, we track our installed base as we track competitive win rates. And I think those trackers clearly give us confidence in the areas where we're gaining share. Doug Schenkel : That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Matt McGrew : Hi, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Good morning, and thanks for the time. Just a couple of easy ones here from me. One is as we go into 2020 and you've laid out the 5% core objective for the broader company pre-GE can you just speak to expectations for growth within the different businesses around that 5%? Matt McGrew : Sure, Steve. I think maybe the simple kind of at a high level the way to think about it is that we're expecting life sciences and diagnostics both to be kind of in the 5% to 6% range, sort of, versus the high single digits that they were last year. And that EAS is kind of continues in call it the 3% to 4% range. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Great. Much appreciated. And then over the course of the year, I wonder if you could speak to a couple of points just within the non-op so we've got our models with many moving parts subsequent to the changes in the last several months and those still coming as tight as we can. I wonder if you could speak to how you would imagine corporate expense plays out over the course of the year relative to that 1Q starting point and maybe relative to 2019. Matt McGrew : Yes. Steve Beuchaw : And then I wonder if over the course of the year how you would imagine share count playing out. Of course there have been a lot of moving parts but is where we are for 1Q just a good benchmark for the full year? Thanks so much. Matt McGrew : Yes. Yes. Sure. No. Lot of moving parts. We appreciate that. So corporate expense Steve I would probably think about $60 million to $65 million per quarter is a good place to start from a modeling perspective. And from a share count perspective in Q1 it's going to be call it 718 million, 719 million shares. I would model in, sort of, kind of our typical share creep of maybe 1 million to 2 million shares a year. And maybe for a full year that 718 million -- call it 720 million 721 million at the end, I think I'd ramp it that way. Steve Beuchaw : Got it. Just all I needed. Thank you so much. Matt McGrew : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks, everyone. Matt McGrew : Good morning. Dan Brennan : Good morning. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I was hoping to dig into a little bit on the diagnostic front. Beckman obviously a nice year in 2019. What do you see for 2020 there? Can you comment on some of the competitive launches? And in particular you mentioned a lot of the new product introductions there in hematology for Beckman. Kind of what's on the horizon for Beckman Diagnostics? Tom Joyce : Sure, Dan. Thanks. As I mentioned in my remarks, we're really pleased with how Beckman performed \u2013 Beck Dx performed in 2019 at a mid-single-digit core growth. And as I think you know, well, that's 100 basis points higher than where we were two years ago. And a number of things have combined here. The new product launches that we've talked about in the last year or so. Automation being one the DxA 5000. We've always had a competitive advantage we believe in the \u2013 in higher volume environments and the DxA 5000 and our automation capability take us, I think to an even more important level. You mentioned hematology. Hematology the DxH 900 with the early sepsis indicator as well as the 500 series both big upgrades to that product line and those are making a difference without a doubt. And they will continue to be, because it's still early days in terms of the penetration of those new products into the market. So we're expecting as we go forward, we'll continue to see solid mid-single-digit growth from that business. And I think that will come from some of the things I just mentioned, but also I think some important product launches that are in the funnel, closing the menu gaps around infectious disease and blood virus and ensuring that we are architecting the hardware side of the house in a way that positions us well at lower volumes. Relative to competitive launches, obviously, this is a business where every competitor cycles through new product launches over a five, seven, 10 year period. There have been \u2013 there certainly is \u2013 are one or two out there right now. At this point, we haven't really seen any material impact to us on our retention or our win rates, but it's always a competitive market and we'll be keeping pace in terms of the competitiveness of our product line. And I think some of the things, I've talked about already are what underpin that. Dan Brennan : Great. And then maybe switching gears over to Pall bio process. Obviously, terrific growth there and you've commented earlier on some of the outlook earlier Tycho's question. I'm just wondering with regards to gene therapy obviously you have nice exposure there as well. But are there any opportunities to maybe expand the portfolio whether internally or externally to kind of capture the expected growth rate in gene therapy? Thank you. Tom Joyce : Sure. Well, it's certainly early days as you know in gene and cell therapy, and there's a lot going on. And Pall is working very closely with a number of customers in that area. But given the nascent nature of those the development of those therapies right now, it will be a while. It will be measured in years before the impact of that may very well become sort of material to Pall in the aggregate. So, a very exciting space for us one that we think we're really well positioned to support, but one that will take a while to evolve. Dan Brennan : Excellent. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question was \u2013 your last question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Tom Joyce : Hey, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, Tom. Great. Maybe just one on Cepheid. That's been as you kind of noted a 20% grower since the deal margins obviously moved significantly higher as well. How should we think about that asset going forward? I mean, it seems like there's still significant opportunities. You talked about the menu expansion areas like China, obviously still underpenetrated. I think you guys are still talking about kind of that low double-digit growth. Now that we've been three years here at 20%-plus, what's the right way to think about that one? Tom Joyce : Thanks, Patrick. It \u2013 when we first acquired Cepheid we were very confident in it sustaining a double-digit core growth rate. And obviously, since that acquisition at 20% better that's been higher than we've expected and it's \u2013 there's a number of factors there a lot of which I think \u2013 a couple of which you might say are somewhat a function of the nature of that business being impacted by flu. We've just come through, I think at least two years in a row here with a particularly strong flu season. We don't bank on that obviously. That's something that we can have a strong season, which is unfortunately for patients and \u2013 but obviously good for that business. And you can have businesses where \u2013 or a season where that's not the case. And so we tend to be somewhat prudent in terms of how we anticipate those seasonal factors to play out. That said, the growth of that business has been certainly sustained by more than just flu. The work they've done in expanding the menu. And driving that installed base. The numbers that I quoted earlier have been a big part of that. So, I think you put all that together. And you say hey! Plan prudently relative to an uplift from something like a flu season, but have confidence that we can sustain that at least a low double-digit growth rate for sure, if not better. And based on the fact that they continue to innovate effectively and have really stepped up their commercial execution. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Europe, pretty solid mid-single-digit growth there, obviously continue to get some mixed data points around that region. You guys always have a pretty good handle given your diverse exposure. Can you just talk through the trends you've seen there, expectations into 2020 visibility, would be really helpful. Tom Joyce : Yeah. I mean, Patrick, we're not a great sort of macro proxy. But relative to our end markets, Europe in some respects has been a pleasant surprise in terms of its being relatively solid in the last couple of quarters. So, I'm not sure that gives me a lot of optimism, in terms of anything that might improve substantially in Europe right now. But I think it's certainly been a solid market for us. If you look across how each of our four platforms are performing there, each of them are doing quite well, but it's obviously a little bit weaker than the other parts of the world. Matt McGrew : Yeah, Patrick maybe just to put some numbers to that, that has been a pretty solid 3% to 4% grower for us for probably six, eight quarters now. And looking forward, I think that's about where we still think it will be. As Tom said, it's probably not as good as some of our other markets like, China and the U.S. which are more mid-to-high single. But I think that 3% to 4% is a pretty good place to -- sort of been, I think it's sort of where we'll be. Patrick Donnelly : Got it, great, thanks, Matt, I appreciate it. Operator : And presenters, that does conclude the allotted time for questions. Do you have any closing remarks? Tom Joyce : Thanks everyone, for joining us. We're around all day for questions.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, please go ahead. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Chrystal. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Tom Joyce, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until May 21, 2020. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the first quarter of 2020, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile starting with second quarter of 2020, we intend to present core revenue growth on a basis that includes Cytiva as if the business had been owned for the current period and the comparable prior year period. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions during this unprecedented time. Their response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been humbling and inspiring. They're working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can continue to provide customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work. Our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive as this crisis has unfolded. Every one of our associates, customers and business partners is making a difference today, and I'm incredibly grateful for their collective efforts. Given how top of mind the impact of the virus is, we felt we would structure the call a little differently this quarter. Before we run through our first quarter results, I will highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight COVID-19. I'll provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of April, and I'll wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming CEO transition. At Danaher, we are incredibly fortunate to navigate these turbulent times from a position of strength, with a resilient portfolio of businesses and extremely talented team and the Danaher Business System as our driving force. These recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our businesses, but they've also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community in the unprecedented fight against COVID-19. We're proud to support the frontline health care providers with much needed diagnostic testing capabilities today and to support the pursuit of new treatments and vaccines for the future. As we collectively strive to contain this novel virus, diagnostic testing provides essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19. IDT was an early leader in this effort, as their primer and probe kits provide a key detection component in COVID-19 diagnostic tests. To date, IDT has shipped kits to enable more than 30 million diagnostic tests for the virus. In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test related to COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. With a leading global installed base of more than 23,000 molecular diagnostic instruments, including 5,000 in the US, Cepheid's tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect health care workers. Since Cepheid's tests became available, the team has shipped approximately two million test cartridges. And going forward, we now expect to be able to ship approximately six million tests per quarter, greatly exceeding our initial expectations. Recently published independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best-in-class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The market leading caliber of Cepheid's test, combined with their significant production ramp up, is a testament to this innovative team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis head on. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus. We expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity, and in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. Beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly, a high-sensitivity automated IgG serology test. The team plans to ramp production capability to more than two million tests in May and over 30 million tests per month by the end of June. This assay will be able to run on Beckman's global installed base of more than 16,000 immunoassay analyzers. As we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19, Pall and Cytiva our supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world, who are working tirelessly to find a cure. Pall's Filtration Solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates. And Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development, providing specific prototype affinity resins and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes. These are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate our customers' important pursuit of COVID-19 testing, treatment, prevention and ultimately a cure. Speaking of Cytiva, I want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher. We're thrilled to have them on board. With the addition of Cytiva, we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end-market to more than $5 billion, which represents approximately 50% of our Life Science platform's annual revenue. With a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow, we're better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life-saving drugs faster and at a lower cost, an important endeavor that's certainly accentuated by today's global health crisis. Cytiva is off to a great start here in 2020 and achieved approximately 10% revenue growth in its first quarter. Given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results, we will include Cytiva's performance as part of our overall core growth revenue metric beginning in the second quarter. So now let's take a look at our first quarter results. Sales grew 3% to $4.3 billion, driven by 4.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%. Geographically, high-single-digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset by high-single-digit declines in high-growth markets. Revenue in China was down more than 25% as a result of extensive shutdowns related to COVID-19. While January and February were solid across North America and Western Europe, we saw a downturn in demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions. Gross profit margin for the first quarter was 56.2% and operating profit margin was 16.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $1.05. We generated $694 million of free cash flow, a 21% increase year-over-year, helping to support our strong financial position. Now we'll take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. Life Science reported revenue increased 1.5% with core revenue growth of 2.5%, led by high-single-digit or better core revenue growth at Pall, IDT and Beckman Life Sciences. The global effort to develop COVID-19-related testing and treatment drove demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. That strong performance was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses Leica Microsystems and SCIEX, which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases. This dynamic was particularly acute in academic research as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to COVID-19-related shutdowns. Moving to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 6%, with 8% core revenue growth led by very strong results at our point-of-care businesses Cepheid and Radiometer. Cepheid achieved more than 40% core revenue growth with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Particularly strength in Cepheid's flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak. We also saw early strong demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 test, which received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization at the end of March. Our Radiometer business achieved high teens core revenue growth. Surges in hospitalized patients being treated for COVID-19 drove demand for Radiometer's blood gas instruments and tests, a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients. With the largest global installed base of blood gas instruments, Radiometer is well positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented healthcare challenge and beyond. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' core revenue decreased mid-single digits. Solid performance in North America and Western Europe was offset by significant declines in China, as a result of the extensive shutdowns initiated in January. These containment measures resulted in very few patients going to hospitals for treatments or procedures that were not COVID -- were not related to COVID-19, which greatly reduced core laboratory testing volumes. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 1% with 2.5% core revenue growth. In our water quality platform mid-single-digit core revenue growth was led by double-digit core revenue growth at ChemTreat. Our Water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world, a mission-critical service in any economic environment. Good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued, while equipment sales declined toward the end of the quarter, as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures. Core revenue at our product identification platform was down low single digits, with growth in marking and coding offset by declines in our packaging solutions businesses. At Videojet, equipment sales were down, but we saw strong demand for consumables across consumer packaged goods, medical and food and beverage end markets, as widespread shelter-in-place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases. So the first quarter was challenging on many fronts. But we believe that the combination of our outstanding team's DBS-driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis. So moving on to what we saw in April. The trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of March. We continued to see a bifurcation across our life science end markets. COVID-19-related research and development increased significantly over the last 60 days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers, particularly in areas like antiviral therapies, vaccine development and immune response research and testing. In turn, this generated strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. Good momentum also continued for other non-COVID-19 related bioprocessing, driving demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products. However, most academic research labs in the U.S. and Europe remained closed and labs in China have only recently started to reopen. These closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders and it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work. Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continued to see very strong demand through April for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving increased instrument placements globally. This contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs, where the significant declines in elective procedures, emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes. We also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs. In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through April. Consumables remain solid, as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods and medicine. But equipment purchases are being delayed, as mission-critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments. The cadence of these end market dynamics appears to be consistent with the spread of the virus, with the negative impact in North America and Western Europe, trailing that of China. China gradually improved in April, as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter. In North America and Western Europe, we believe that declines are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months, as these regions begin to gradually reopen. In light of these recent trends, we expect second quarter core revenue growth including Cytiva to be in the range of flat to down 10%. So to wrap up, as I reflect on the events of the last few months, I am humbled by our team's dedication and innovative response to this unprecedented crisis. True to our core values, our associates are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges. Never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant and I'm so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion. Looking ahead, we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment. We believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio exceptional team and DBS-driven execution will continue to differentiate Danaher in 2020 and beyond. Now before we go to Q&A, I want to address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming CEO transition. After more than 30 years at Danaher, including the last six as CEO, I've decided to begin the transition to retirement. I do this knowing that Danaher has never been stronger. The combination of our portfolio enhanced execution around innovation and our seasoned leadership team driven by the Danaher Business System create a strong foundation for continued outperformance. I have loved every day of the past three decades. And throughout my entire Danaher career, I've been privileged to be part of an incredible team. I've always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency, enhancing the portfolio, driving innovation and developing talent. And I can now look back fondly on the tremendous progress we've made on all these fronts. I plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months and I'm confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come. Many of you know Rainer Blair well from his days as President of SCIEX and more recently is our EVP leading the evolution of our Life Science platform, enhancing the platform's growth and margin profile while leading the acquisitions of Pall, IDT and Cytiva to name just a few. There is no question that Rainer is the right person to lead us into the future. With the support of our senior leadership team and our Board, I'm confident that Rainer is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our shareholders. So what's next for me? Well first off that question is one for several months from now. But I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family and I'll continue to serve on the Boards of MedStar Health and the College of the Holy Cross. I'll remain in the CEO role through September 1st of this year and I'll be around into 2021 in an advisory role. But for now and as soon as we finish this call, we will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt, so we can start taking your questions. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Chrystal, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hey. So a couple of questions and then I'll congratulate you on the retirement, I'm jealous by the way. So to start off, so can you tell us what you're embedding into the guide in the 2Q for COVID-related contributions? I mean, you're producing a lot of Cepheid tests, the serologies ramping. I guess, are all those tests going to be used what all was spoken for? I mean, I was just curious in terms of what do you think about utilization and sort of what's embedded into the guide? Thanks. Tom Joyce : Sure. Okay. Thanks Derik. Happy to walk you through that a bit. So let's go right to the COVID impact in Q2. And I would think about it as largely a tailwind that probably represents 500 basis points of improvement or growth that's associated predominantly with Cepheid, Radiometer and IDT. And in terms of the related question about what's spoken for, Cepheid -- we're flat out at Cepheid. We are continuing to expand our capacity, but every test that we produce every single day gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build. Radiometer also running flat out, not quite the need for expanded capacity. We had the surge capacity we needed there, but they're doing exceptionally well and IDT holding its own as well. So I think overall you'd consider Cepheid Radiometer and IDT certainly contributors on the positive side. What that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is potentially down anywhere from 5% to 15%. And those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like Beckman Diagnostics, Leica Biosystems a bit that are more patient volume-dependent and we'll have to see whether that patient volume coming from loosening up of elective procedures starts to return. But certainly the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment-oriented business like LMS and SCIEX and a bit of PID no doubt. So, now putting all that together you then partially offset that with probably a bit of positive from Pall and Cytiva that are showing positive growth that's not exclusively COVID-related, but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines. So, I think that's the way, I'd sort of generally frame up the pluses and the minuses around the COVID impact in Q2. Matt McGrew : And Derik, it's Matt. I just want to make sure also you've kind of \u2013 we mentioned serology. We are not assuming anything here in the quarter for serology. Even though we're ramping up with Beckman and we're going to have some capacity here our view is that it's just a little too early to really kind of tell what the volumes might look like what a national testing program or any other kind of local testing programs might look like. So that COVID tailwind does not include serology just to be clear. Derik De Bruin : Great. That's really helpful. And I guess just one question on Cytiva. In general, did you see any stocking in the first quarter? And I'm just curious what are you assuming for organic revenue growth in the Cytiva stand-alone business for the second quarter? Tom Joyce : Derik, we saw very little. It's always hard to tell when it's on the margins as to whether or not there was stocking going on there. Generally, we don't think it was particularly material. But I'd tell you Cytiva was off to a great start, as I mentioned 10% core growth in the first quarter really strong momentum in the core bioprocessing business and that's really driven by folks working on solutions to COVID-19. And, but as we look forward, I think we have really as you can imagine given we just closed the end of March 1st of April, we're just getting in there to really understand what that funnel looks like. And there's plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time depending on the progression of therapies and vaccines. So I think we've got an outstanding start here. But in terms of where we are from a guide perspective on Cytiva, we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like. Obviously, we haven't even gotten face-to-face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint given the limitations we have here on travel. So right now, we're going to focus on obviously a good deal of re-branding work that we need to do. We're going to stand it up as a stand-alone operating company, execute on the TSA and exit those TSA work streams and costs and make sure that we're embedding DBS into the business and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance. So we'll come back and give you a better sense of what Cytiva looks like in the balance of the year, once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of how the bookings trends look and we round the corner here coming into the second half of the year. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you. Tom Joyce : Thanks. Derik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Thanks. Good morning. Tom I'll start with congrats on the transition. I think it might be helpful to hear from you why now is the right time? I know you plan these things out well in advance. But I think people were caught a little bit off guard in the middle of pandemic after closing your largest deals. So could you maybe just talk a little bit about how long this transition had been planned? And why now is the right time? Tom Joyce : Sure. Absolutely, Tycho, I'd be happy to. I can honestly say that, you would have to go all the way back to my very first year in the role where we along with the Board made sure that, we talked about talent development, about ensuring that we are progressing in various ways through our leadership ranks to get to the point, where we are today and had an outstanding choice in Rainer Blair to succeed me. So this has very much been the culmination of a succession planning process that really has gone on over the last five or six years. We always want to do something like this, when we're in a position of strength. And I think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance, where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what I think makes us very comfortable that this is certainly a good time to turn the reins over. It was super important that we got Cytiva closed. And that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here of the role allows for both Rainer and I to contribute to ensuring that Cytiva comes into the organization smoothly. So I think it's really a combination of all those things. I think the Danaher Board was incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along. I am really excited about Rainer and the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role and he's just going to do a fantastic job. So we all feel great about it. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thanks. And then for the follow-up just a question on some of the longer-term COVID-related tailwinds. For Cepheid there's presumed to be less rule-in rule-out flu testing tied to COVID going forward. So I'm curious how you think about that? And then how you think about durability of that test once there is a vaccine on the market? For Beckman curious, if you can put anything around pricing for serology? And then lastly for Cytiva and Pall just curious how meaningful you think vaccine and therapy development could be for those businesses on a multiyear basis? Thanks. Tom Joyce : Sure. Thanks, Tycho. There's -- we've got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts of COVID and I think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned both on the short-term and the long-term. I think if you start with from a diagnostic testing perspective Cepheid's impact along with IDT Radiometer in terms of treatment on the frontline as well as Beckman and serology and IgG testing, I think, that's a pretty unique combination of capabilities. Now you asked about the durability of the Cepheid test. I think -- as you know well, we are one of the world leaders in flu testing. And I think as we see the future here you're going to look -- clinicians are going to be looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing COVID-19 testing. And I think the ability to run those tests on the same platform and the same cartridge, obviously, with the same cartridge configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have for Cepheid. Of course, as this surge in demand now is happening we're seeing that not only in terms of the test cartridges themselves, but it's driving a significant increase in our installed base. And so as that installed base has grown, you're also going to see that installed base driving not only COVID-19 testing, but it's continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for Cepheid over time. And obviously, there's a broader suite of tests that run on the Cepheid architecture and so that's going to benefit as well. So we think there's exceptional durability to the Cepheid architecture in an environment even in one where we have and god willing we will have both therapies as well as vaccines. In terms of your question about Beckman and serology, I think, the way we see serology evolving over time is it's going to be primarily driven obviously with a blood draw. And you're going to see the serology test, the IgG test integrated into more routine testing. And therefore, the cost per test is going to be quite reasonable and it's going to be in line with other immunoassay tests. And so while we talk about the capacity to have 30 million tests as I think Matt said earlier wouldn't build that into any models, but I think it's representative of the fact that serology testing that IgG test is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunoassay. So I think a lot of terrific potential there particularly as it relates to advances in public health and population testing. And some of the work that's being done by public health authorities to look for hotspots over time. In terms of your question about Cytiva and work around therapies and vaccines, I'd say both Pall and Cytiva are uniquely positioned to provide pretty critical inputs meaning filtration and resins to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates. Right now we would estimate that they're greater than 150 therapeutic and vaccine candidates today. And Pall and Cytiva are working with a majority of those in some capacity. And so obviously there'll be winners and losers, but we think we have a number of exceptional positions there with folks that are likely going to be part of the future therapy and/or vaccine answers. So I think a good spot to be in. Tycho Peterson : Great. I appreciate it and congrats again on the retirement. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Good morning, guys and Tom congrats on a well-earned rest. I think -- maybe starting with the leadership question here Tom. You mentioned Rainer not -- he's known to the Street, but perhaps not everyone knows him well. And you did mention that he was the right person. Maybe contrast your leadership style versus -- with Rainer's leadership style, what does Rainer bring here? And what should investors look forward to under this transition? Tom Joyce : Sure. Well, I'd start Vijay with the fact that Rainer and I have worked together closely for virtually all of his 10 years. I don't know, if everybody knows that when Rainer was first hired at Danaher he came in initially as the President of Videojet. And I'm not sure Rainer and his wife Elaine had actually unpacked their bags when we had -- we were looking to succeed me at SCIEX -- after the SCIEX acquisition, I was headed off to Beckman and we had this outstanding leader who had just come into Videojet and the real need at SCIEX and Rainer repacked and moved to Boston and led SCIEX for a number of years and just did an exceptional job. And he and I have worked together literally every day since then, through the work at SCIEX, through the acquisitions of Pall and IDT, obviously, throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become Cytiva, our largest acquisition ever. And so, when you work together for as long as we have, I guess, there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the two of us. But Vijay, you're going to have plenty of time to ask Rainer that question and he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the two of us than I will. He's an outstanding individual, he is super smart. He is steeped in the domains, not only in life science, but across Danaher. He's unbelievably well-respected across Danaher, as a DBS leader, a great teacher, a DBS practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the Danaher core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life's potential every single day. His track record relative to M&A and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to place bets, both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is unparalleled. So I hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the two of us in terms of what we value, but Rainer will put his own mark on Danaher and I am supremely confident that that mark on Danaher is going to be an outstanding one and an indelible one. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful perspective, Tom. Just maybe one housekeeping question perhaps for Matt. Matt, I think, the press release had a couple of hundred basis points contribution from Cytiva. That perhaps implies double digits, maybe, even low teens growth in the business. I just want to make sure with the business doing 10%, I think, in Q1, continuing double digits in 2Q, is that just the business growth as usual? Or was there any contribution, perhaps from COVID-related business? And then, perhaps, also address the decremental margins here for 2Q? Thanks, guys. Matt McGrew : Yes. Sure. So from Cytiva perspective, I mean, I think it grew 10% there in Q1. I think that's probably a reasonable place for the business to be here in the second quarter as well. So I think your math on that is pretty correct. As far as decremental margins go, I think the place that I'd start is probably about 40% decrementals. It can vary quite a bit depending on mix, et cetera. But I think starting with 40% is a good place to start. I will tell you that probably in Q2, in Diagnostics though, probably need to be more like 50% or 60% decrementals and that's all related to FX. So that delta will be because of FX here in the quarter, so 40%, overall, maybe a touch higher here in Q2 in Diagnostics. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : We have reached the allotted time for questions. Your last question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats, Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Scott Davis : It's been a great six years. I'm a little surprised you're going, but I don't blame you. It's -- retirement sounds pretty interesting right now. Tom Joyce : Scott, it was not informed by the current economic uncertainties. It was very much part of the plan. Scott Davis : Yes. Sure. Sure, I believe that. Anyway, so I wish you the best. I know, we'll see you before you go, but anyway\u2026 Tom Joyce : Thank you. Scott Davis : A great run. Tom Joyce : Thank you. Scott Davis : With -- just switching to business what are the challenges of integrating Cytiva here in this kind of new world? I mean, can you really teach DBS and do Kaizens and all that stuff on a Zoom video? Tom Joyce : Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. Yes, is the answer to that. Why do I -- why would that be the case, given how important being it -- we use that term, being at gemba, being in the real place, how important we talk about that being. Well, we actually kicked off DBS training what we call ECO, Executive Champion Orientation. We kicked that off virtually using Microsoft Teams just two weeks ago. I kicked it off, Rainer was on the call. John Sekowski, who you know from our DBS office, led the effort. We probably touched -- we got more people through that ECO over that day, day-and-a-half, I forgot the full duration, because of actually being able to use a virtual tool and so -- a digital tool. And so, the answer is, we're working. We're doing our best. We're off to a good start. We've got to get creative. We've got to invent new ways to get things done. Interestingly, our existing businesses outside of Cytiva are in fact doing multi-day Kaizens using virtual tools, using Zoom using Microsoft Teams and it's not the same, it's different. We wouldn't use that as a standard going forward. We absolutely value being face-to-face. But we've challenged our teams to get creative and continue to drive continuous improvement even in this environment. Scott Davis : Okay. That's encouraging. Just switching gears I know there's been a lot of questions around Cepheid and Beckman as there should be. But if you go down to Environmental & Applied Solutions, you've got some interesting businesses at different cyclicalities and such. Is there kind of a range of outcomes in 2Q that we can start to think about for those businesses? I know you've made some encouraging comments on Videojet but -- and actually just Water too. But on an overall basis at least Tom, is there any color you can give on that? Tom Joyce : Yes. Yes. Scott, these are fantastic businesses even in a challenging economic environment. I mean Hach's leadership position in Water Quality analytics four times to five times its nearest competitor; Videojet, a leader from a share perspective as well. Both obviously heavily skewed towards -- their balance of sales skewed towards consumables, north of 70%, 75% in those businesses being aftermarket consumables and service. When water quality testing has to be done every single day in municipalities around the world when consumer packaged goods have to be marked and shipped every single day around the world, those consumables continue to underpin reasonably steady performance. I mean they are a safety net under the revenue structures of those businesses. And while there'll be some other dimensions the -- like the equipment side in water quality for example or even in PID and some of the software businesses that will be a little bit more pressured here, I think those are still really solid businesses even in these challenging times. So, I wouldn't trade those businesses for any in their markets. Scott Davis : I should ask it differently I guess. Should -- will this segment be down more than your corporate average, Tom? Tom Joyce : Well, yes I mean I think they would be down a bit more only because they're not buoyed by the terrific performance that we continue to see at Cepheid and IDT as well as Radiometer and even with what we think is going to be pretty solid performance at Cytiva and Pall. So, yes, I think these businesses would be at the lower end of the core growth component. You could potentially see the segment EAS down potentially mid-to-high teens inside of the guide. Scott Davis : Okay. Perfect. Thank you and congrats again Tom. Best of luck. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Scott. Good to hear from you today. Matt Gugino : Chrystal, that concludes our questions. Do you want to get any final remarks? Well thanks everyone for joining us today. We're around all day for questions. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher\u2019s overall core revenue growth profile, we are presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. References to core revenue growth, including Cytiva sales and the calculation of period-to-period sales growth compare to the current period of Cytiva sales to the historical period Cytiva sales prior to the acquisition. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, especially in such a challenging environment. Our solid core revenue growth, strong cash flow generation, and more than 30% EPS growth are a testament to our team\u2019s commitment to the Danaher business system and the outstanding portfolio of businesses that comprise Danaher today. We are tackling the challenges and opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic head on and are fortunate to do so from a position of strength. These circumstances have showcased the resilience of our portfolio, a unique collection of market-leading franchises and technologies with a high level of recurring revenue and a foundation of continuous improvement. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and will enable us to continue generating sustainable, long-term value for shareholders for many years to come. Before we run through our second quarter results, I would like to provide an update on a few of the ways we are directly contributing to the fight against COVID-19 today and well into the future. Diagnostic testing has been a critical component of the global community\u2019s attempts to better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19 and Cepheid has been a leader in this effort. In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular tests for COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. Multiple independent studies indicate that Cepheid\u2019s test performance is best-in-class versus other point of care platforms on the market today providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The team has meaningfully increased production capacity since the test was launched shipping more than 6 million test cartridges in the second quarter. As a testament to Cepheid\u2019s commitment to tackle this global health crisis, the team recently announced the development of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar, but the treatments are very different. So, the test is being designed to provide critical answers within 35 minutes to ensure the best patient outcome. The 4-in-1 test is expected to launch in the third quarter ahead of the upcoming flu season. In addition to ramping test production, Cepheid also delivered a record number of new instruments to customers in the second quarter. The installed base grew double-digits and the number of new instrument placements was more than 4x that of a typical quarter. This significantly increases Cepheid\u2019s install base, which now totals more than 26,000 instruments globally bringing essential diagnostic information closer to more patients and communities around the world. Another addition to our diagnostic testing capabilities was the launch of Beckman Coulter Diagnostics serology test in June. This highly sensitive and specific assay can identify IgG antibodies to the virus, which typically begins to develop within the first 14 days of infection. Antibody assays could potentially play an important role in understanding immunity and in turn improving the world\u2019s ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. As we look beyond testing, a global race designed to find effective treatments for COVID-19 and we are proud to support the scientific community in their pursuit of new vaccines and therapies and therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva\u2019s products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 200 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway around the world, including participation on every COVID-19 vaccine that is in human clinical trials today. Our unique offering across the bio-processing workflow positions us exceptionally well to help bring vaccines and therapies to market faster. In addition to our market leading filtration, chromatography and single-use technologies, Pall and Cytiva\u2019s innovative teams provide customers with extensive technical expertise to enable breakthrough development and production capabilities. One such example is Pall\u2019s process development services team, which is helping customers scale up their vaccine production processes significantly faster and in one instance accomplishing in just a few weeks would typically take months or even years. These innovative bio-processing solutions are just a few examples of how we are helping to accelerate the pursuit of COVID-19 prevention and ultimately a cure. Now, let\u2019s look at our second quarter results. We generated $5.3 billion of sales with 3.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 2%. We also saw strong order growth in the quarter just under 10%, led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics platforms. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up mid single-digits led by North America and Western Europe. High growth markets were up slightly driven by a meaningful sequential improvement in China, which was up low single-digits year-over-year. Gross profit margin of 53.8% and operating profit margin of 15.9% were both down primarily as a result of fair value adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition. Excluding these adjustments, both growth and operating profit margins increased by more than 150 basis points year-over-year. Core operating profit margin was down 80 basis points driven by slightly lower volume, excluding Cytiva, foreign exchange rate movements and higher corporate expense. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.44 were up 32% versus last year. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date both up approximately 35% or more year-over-year. Our outstanding free cash flow combined with a strong balance sheet positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities in this environment. We are also accelerating growth investments across Danaher, most notably at Cepheid and many of our life science businesses, where we are expanding production capacity to support the fight against COVID-19. Now, let\u2019s take a more detailed look at results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 8% led by high-teens or better core growth at Cytiva, Pall Biotech, and IDT. More specifically, Cytiva achieved more than 20% core revenue growth in its first full quarter as part of Danaher, exceeding our expectations. Demand for our bio-processing, genomic and automation solutions, was driven by ongoing global efforts to develop COVID-19 testing and treatments. This was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses, SCIEX and Leica Microsystems. Academic and research lab closures delayed installations of existing instrument orders and new capital purchases, particularly across developed markets. And despite this difficult environment, SCIEX successfully launched multiple new products earlier this month, including the Triple Quad 7500 mass spectrometer. The new 7500 marked SCIEX\u2019s most significant launch of the last 5 years and reinforces their market leadership in quantitative mass spectrometry. This is another great example of how we are continuing to invest for growth across Danaher and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation. Moving to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 2.5%, with 5% core revenue growth led by continued strength at our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. Global demand for Cepheid\u2019s COVID-19 tests and GeneXpert instruments helped drive more than 100% core revenue growth at Cepheid in the quarter. Radiometer delivered double-digit core revenue growth as elevated levels of COVID-19 hospitalizations drove demand for blood gas testing. A record number of new ABL blood gas analyzers were delivered during the quarter further expanding Radiometer\u2019s market leading global installed base. This strong performance was partially offset by declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, and Leica Biosystems, our core laboratory and pathology businesses. Patient volumes were down meaningfully as elective procedures and wellness business visits resumed slowly throughout the quarter, particularly across the U.S. and Europe. This was partially offset by improvements in China, where hospital visits began to approach pre-pandemic levels. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue was down 10.5% and core revenue declined 8.5%. By geography, declines in North America and Western Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. At our water quality platform, mid single-digit core revenue declines were driven by industrial and market softness, while municipalities remained stable. Steady demand for our consumables and chemistries globally was offset by delayed equipment purchases, particularly in the developed markets. However, we were encouraged by strong results in China during the quarter as activity returned to more normalized levels across the region. Core revenue at our product identification platform was down double-digits largely due to equipment revenue decline as mission-critical operating expenses were prioritized over larger capital investments. At Videojet, positive consumables growth was led by demand across the consumer packaged goods and food end markets. Service performed well \u2013 as well as we continued to support customers throughout the pandemic helping to keep their essential business operations up and running. So with that as a context for what we saw by segment, let\u2019s take a closer look at recent trends across our end-markets. Encouragingly, the dynamics of the quarter were largely a continuation of what we outlined in early May. April appeared to be the trough with modest improvement as we move through May and June. Geographically, we continue to see improving activity in China, with Europe following suit albeit at a slower pace. Resumption of activity in the U.S. is mixed with many states only recently beginning phased re-openings and others experiencing setbacks in the process. Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a bifurcation across our end markets. The recent surge in COVID-19 related research and development, among our biotech and pharmaceutical customers, is generating strong demand for our bio-processing genomic and automation solutions. Non-COVID related bio-processing activity also remains very healthy, contributing to demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprised the majority of our exposure to the bio-processing end markets. And collectively, these two businesses had more than 40% growth in their order book in the quarter, a strong indication of the longer term opportunities we are seeing here. Meanwhile, widespread shutdowns continue to impact non-COVID related research lab activities. Labs in the U.S. recently started to reopen, but are operating at limited capacity and with distinct variations by region. The story in Europe is similar to the U.S., while China is further along and activity appears to be approaching pre-pandemic levels. We estimate that approximately 50% to 60% of academic research labs in developed markets are now open in some capacity. That number is closer to 90% in China, where installations have resumed and instrument order books are building. Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continue to see very strong demand for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving a significant increase in instrument placements globally. Across hospital labs and reference labs, we were encouraged to see patient volumes ramp up as we move through the quarter, with elective procedures and wellness checks resuming across much of the developed markets. Today, we estimate that patient volumes in North America are approximately 85% to 90% of historical levels, with Europe slightly ahead and China even further along given their earlier reopenings. In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment appears to be lessening. Consumables remains solid as customers sustain essential business operations, like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods, food and medicine. Equipment declines are starting to moderate and we are encouraged by recent order book trends. In light of these recent dynamics, we expect to deliver mid to high single-digit quarter revenue growth in the third quarter. We anticipate COVID-19 related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the second quarter. By segment, we expect core revenue growth at Life Sciences to be up double-digit \u2013 low double-digits, Diagnostics up high single-digits and Environmental & Applied Solutions to be approximately flat. So to wrap up, we are proud of our results this quarter. Our team stayed focused on executing and continued to find innovative ways to tackle the challenges and opportunities presented by this pandemic. We are excited about the portfolio that we have today and how it will continue to differentiate us going forward. And we are fortunate to navigate through this environment from a position of strength, with our solid balance sheet and outstanding cash flow generation enabling us to be nimble and opportunistic. We believe that the combination of our talented team, DBS-driven execution and resilient portfolio uniquely positioned Danaher to outperform in 2020 and well into the future. With that, Matt, I will turn the call back over to you so that we can start taking questions. Matt McGrew : Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Maria, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hey, I got a couple to start with. I think the first one is, can you \u2013 we are getting a number of questions on the margin math for the second quarter and the inventory step-ups. Can you talk about the dynamics of that? And the better \u2013 the more important questions like, how did the gross and operating margins progress now that Cytiva is fully into the numbers and how should we think about the rest of the year? Tom Joyce : Yes, sure, Derek. I will take it. So the gross margin, we saw kind of a decline of 200 basis points sort of year-over-year. Like Tom said in the prepared remarks, that is entirely driven by inventory step-ups related to the Cytiva acquisition in the quarter. So, if you exclude that impact, our gross margins are, I call it, closer to 58%, which would have been up a couple of 100 basis points year-over-year and again, I think largely driven by Cytiva. And that should be sort of one-time here in the quarter, Derek, that we get by as we start to move. That\u2019s a one time thing here in the quarter. So going forward, you shouldn\u2019t see that. Derik De Bruin : Okay, that\u2019s \u2013 yes, I just want to clarify that and how should we sort of \u2013 and how should we think about the SG&A and the R&D the OpEx lines? Matt McGrew : I don\u2019t know that we had tremendous amount of kind of step-up issues in either of those two lines. I think about the R&D line, I think while I do think we will continue kind of invest in accelerate some spend here in the second half, I think more or less, the R&D line should stay pretty constant, again, outside of the investments that, that we are going to make here in the second half, largely around Cytiva. I think we are probably a little bit heavier investing there. But generally speaking, I think we are biased here in this environment to continue to try and spend to make sure that we position ourselves not only for where we are in the short-term here in \u201820, but to make sure that as we head into 2021 that we are in the best position possible. So might be how I think about it going forward. Derik De Bruin : Great. Tom Joyce : Yes. I would I would add to that, Derik, just echoing Matt\u2019s comments, we are obviously very fortunate to have a portfolio that now includes businesses like Cytiva, Pall Biotech obviously, Cepheid, driving outside performance and with outstanding operating margins. And I think you know our track record historically is, we like to take advantage of situations like this to continue to invest for the future. And some of that investment shows up in the sales line, some in the marketing line and certainly some in the R&D line. And I think you will see us continue to try to do that, because we feel well-positioned in our markets and we think that there are selective opportunities to continue to invest with growth and that will set us up exceptionally well, not only for rest of this year, but most importantly, I think for next year as we see the environment improve. Derik De Bruin : Great. If I can squeeze in one diagnostics question, you mentioned the 4-in-1 test coming out, it\u2019s like how are you pricing that multiplex test? And also just talk about Cepheid capacity expansions, I mean, you have obviously picked it up since you \u2013 since March, but how should we think about where your cartridge development year can go or your production can go over the next couple of quarters? Matt McGrew : Sure. Well, we are not yet at a point where we are in a position to talk about pricing on the 4-in-1 test. But certainly, this is a test that is going to be incredibly important in the market. We are going to continue to produce standalone tests as well, but there is no question our customers have expressed very strong interest in a targeted respiratory panel that brings together COVID, Flu A, Flu B and RSV. So we will be sizing up the opportunities relative to pricing over the next several weeks and be coming back with that. So, we think there is a tremendous opportunity there. Relative to Cepheid capacity, we continue to build on our output capabilities. You will recall, in the first quarter, I think we were at about 2 million tests and we were just ramping. We ramped well throughout the course of the quarter to 6 million tests. And we are going to \u2013 we have released a significant amount of capital to continue to build that capacity, some of that capital that we have released is going to take a little bit of time to come online. We will see some modest growth in the third quarter here and even more significant growth as we go into the fourth quarter and then certainly throughout 2021. I think key to this, Derik is our view that there is a tremendous amount of durability and sustainability to the testing benefits that Cepheid delivers to the market. Certainly, there is a lot of variables, there is plenty of competition. But when you look at the speed and the accuracy that we deliver and the value that we deliver associated with the diagnosis, there is no doubt that, that demand is going to be sustained over time. So, we are going to continue to ramp that capacity and sustain our strong positions in the market. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you. Matt McGrew : Thanks, Derik. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Tom on the COVID tailwinds, you noted 3Q [Technical Difficulty] comment on Cepheid, how much of the volume do you expect to go to 4-in-1 versus standalone COVID testing going forward? Tom Joyce : Tycho, I am assuming you can hear me clearly, we couldn\u2019t hear anything on your question on, unfortunately, just except for the very last part of the question around 4-in-1. So, I am going to try the 4-in-1 answer and then we will see if you come through clearer. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Tom Joyce : So, I think your question was how much volume is going to move to the 4-in-1? We do not know the answer to that at this point. It\u2019s we believe it will be significant and material, but in terms of putting a number on it quite yet, we just don\u2019t have enough voice of customer yet. Obviously, we haven\u2019t developed the pricing model yet and we are building capacity. So, we will have to come back to you probably in the next couple of months with a better sense of how we see that volume ramping. Again, we will continue to produce the standalone test so there will be a balance there. Time will tell on the overall volume. So, let\u2019s try the earlier part of your question again. Tycho Peterson : Yes. It\u2019s just [Technical Difficulty] vaccine and therapy work, why shouldn\u2019t you see a more material COVID tailwind in 3Q? Tom Joyce : Okay. We only caught \u2013 we really apologize, we only caught the tail end of that. I am looking at my team on video and they can\u2019t \u2013 they couldn\u2019t hear that either. But let me just try to \u2013 let me try to hit it a bit, because I think you asked about vaccines\u2026 Tycho Peterson : Why wouldn\u2019t a 3Q tailwind be more material than 2Q for COVID? Tom Joyce : Why? Let me see if I got that. You were asking about the Q3 tailwind? Tycho Peterson : For COVID. Tom Joyce : Okay, got it. Tycho Peterson : Why is that more material given how much you have grown the Cepheid installed base and you have got Cytiva and Pall, why wouldn\u2019t it be more material in 3Q versus 2Q? Tom Joyce : Sure, sure. Absolutely. Sorry. I apologize that the transmission was so poor, but I think we got it now. We are going to see that volume continue to track. I think there was an outsized impact, certainly at Cepheid during the course of the second quarter with that instrument volume boosting at the rate that it did. We don\u2019t expect that, that necessarily will continue to grow quite at that rate. So, I think that\u2019s one mitigating factor. And I think as it relates to both Pall Biotech and Cytiva, I think we will see continued traction there. But at the moment, we think that what we are seeing from customers is a demand that is again given the quick ramp that was associated with the 200 or so vaccine and therapeutic-related efforts that are going on that those are likely to be more consistent in the third quarter rather than differentially higher. So, those are just some of the factors that perhaps that\u2019s a little bit conservative. If so, we will take that, but in line, that\u2019s our best estimate at the moment. Tycho Peterson : And then Tom, can you put in the \u2013 go ahead, Matt. Matt McGrew : Yes. No, I just wanted to kind of get out. We are expecting \u2013 from a tailwind perspective, we are expecting a modestly higher benefit here in the quarter for everything Tom talked about sort of more or less the same volumes at Cepheid, but with a bit of a tailwind or a headwind here on the instrument side. But I mean, I think if you think about what we are going to be doing here in the fourth quarter and into \u201821, particularly around the build-out on Cytiva and if you think about our tailwinds build on the Cytiva \u2013 sorry build on the Cepheid capacity that\u2019s coming online. And then probably as importantly, we had 40% growth in orders at both Cytiva and Pall Biotech here in the quarter. And while we don\u2019t expect all of that to show up here in Q3, that does portend well for what we think the second half will sort of look like and as we head into \u201821 and that was not just on vaccines, but that was sort of kind of evenly split between vaccines and the therapeutics, which you know are a big part too. So, while we may have a more modest expectation for the third quarter, I think that there is a ramp as we head through the second half and then particularly into \u201821. Tycho Peterson : And then lastly, is there any color you can put on the vaccine and therapy work for Pall and Cytiva, I mean, you are not doing fill/finish work. So, there is no kind of per dose calculation, but could you just help us think about the magnitude of that work? Tom Joyce : There are. Gosh, I mean, we are certainly working on that and given our exposure across the broad range of human clinical trials that are going on right now. We are starting to get a handle on those opportunities, but there are still so many unknowns to make sizing it tough. I mean, it\u2019s the number and different types of winning vaccines and therapeutics, questions about production volumes, number of steps in each process. So, I mean, there is no question that it\u2019s going to be a large and sustained opportunity, but it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s just become \u2013 it\u2019s a very hard number for us to wrap our minds around today. But I am sure we will get a handle on it as it becomes clearer who the winners are and how that production volume will ramp within any individual winner. We are not going to have dozens and dozens of winners here. I think we will have several winners and once we have more line of sight to where the winners are then obviously we can get a better sense of their dosage production volumes, our position there and what that means when you translate that into a sales volume. Tycho Peterson : Alright. Thanks, guys. Sorry about the quality issues before. Tom Joyce : Yes, sorry Tycho. Thanks, though. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Good morning, Tom. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the solid execution through. Maybe I will start with Cytiva, 40% order growth, the implication of that is \u2013 I mean, if that business is contributing about 400 basis points of growth right now and the order book is running 2x that of the growth rates right now. The implication is that business should contribute 400 to 500 basis points of growth in fiscal \u201821 if assuming all of the orders that we are seeing flow-through get recognized as revenues in fiscal \u201821? Does it make sense? Matt McGrew : Yes, I mean, I think it\u2019s \u2013 this is Matt. I mean, I think the issue with that \u2013 the math can make sense, but it\u2019s the assumption around the timing, I think that we just are still kind of TBD on, Vijay, whether that starts to flow real hard here in the third or fourth quarter or if it starts in the first half of \u201821. I think that\u2019s the only question that\u2019s really around the timing. But like I said, earlier with my comments, I mean, I think we are pretty encouraged by the start of Cytiva both on top line, the core business outside of COVID and the COVID opportunity that\u2019s starting to emerge that you saw with that level of orders growth. Vijay Kumar : And just on the margin itself, Matt, I mean, if you look at I think the deal model had Cytiva running at mid-30s. It looks like it came in well above 40%. Is that \u2013 is there any timing element on those margins or how sustainable is the Cytiva on the margin side? Matt McGrew : Yes, sure. Cytiva margins did come in north of 40 in Q2, which is obviously, like you said better than sort of the recent performance that we had seen out of them. I think there is three things to think about on the reason for that. One, you know, we had higher volume here north of 20% core growth does give you lots of opportunities from the fall-through perspective from a VCM perspective. So, we did have higher volumes. The other thing \u2013 the second thing is there is probably a very favorable mix element here. We had sort of the higher margin businesses like process chromatography grew double-digits, while more of the equipment heavy businesses will call it low single-digits, which was kind of a very favorable mix impact in the quarter. And the third thing is and I think you\u2019ve seen it a lot of places, we just have a lot lower OpEx spend given the stay-at-home orders, right, travel, trade shows, etcetera, was sort of much lower. So I think if you add it all up, that\u2019s how we sort of went from where we thought it would be to sort of north of 40, but I would sort of maybe temper some expectations here as we head into margin, think about the margins in Q3. Like I said, Q2 was sort of a perfect storm with everything going the right way, but there is two things that I think to think about as we head forward into Q3 in the second half. One is this is a business that we are going to accelerate the growth investments in, not unlike we have done with our other businesses, we alluded to that earlier in the call. But in particular, this business one, given the plethora of growth opportunities that are out there and across all of their businesses, not just bio-processing and frankly the business we have got to invest as much as it would have liked maybe in the past and we are very eager to make sure that they have every opportunity affording to them. So that\u2019s one. And then two, we are 90 days into this from a kind of standing it up on its own, if you will. And so our standup costs, the number of people we have hired, the cost that we put into the business so far to get it stood up and off of sort of the GE kind of apparatus that is going to ramp as we go through the second half. And that will have an impact here on the margin profile as well. So good, good start for sure, little bit better than we thought on a perfect storm. But I do think there is some moderation coming. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful, Matt. And one big picture for Tom. Tom, if you look at the balance sheet, $5 plus billion of cash in hand, free cash looks like we are run-rating well above $5 billion. I am just curious I think at the time of second week, you guys made comments about the ways being opportunistic? I am just curious how your thoughts on cap deployment are evolving in the current environment? Thanks, guys. Tom Joyce : Sure, Vijay. Thank you. Yes, we are in a very strong and fortunate position relative to our balance sheet and that position continues to be reinforced by really exceptional free cash flow, a $2 billion cash flow number on a year-to-date basis really continues to put us in a great spot. When I talk about opportunistic, that\u2019s a term that we would typically use associated with a very uncertain sort of disrupted environment like we are coming through in the first quarter and continue to see in the second quarter and that sometimes creates opportunities that for whatever reason, we may not have seen coming, businesses that get into a spot where all of a sudden, they have a change of heart about their future and we are able to take advantage of that. But with the strength of the balance sheet that we have now on the back of the equity offering that we did, the strength of the free cash flow here in the second quarter and what we see is continuing strength net free cash flow in the third and fourth quarters, that positions us to really continue to work hard on the strategic opportunities that we focus on consistently throughout the course of the year and that goes across each one of our platforms, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, water quality and PID, each of them continuing to focus on key market segments, where there are unique opportunities, key product and technology opportunities, where we can complement the strength of our existing portfolio and in some cases bring on a unique and differentiating leg of the portfolio that allows us to add greater value to customers everyday. And so I think we are in a great position. We are starting to see some improvement in the environment in the second quarter. One example of that is a deal that we did for our water quality platform, Aqua Informatics in the second quarter, that was a deal that was essentially put on hold earlier in the first quarter as things tightened up. But as things started to improve, we were able to reengage and we are able to consummate that acquisition in the second quarter. And that\u2019s a tremendous add of a key data management and software capability for our water quality platform. And we are looking forward to do that team playing significant roles. That\u2019s just one example. But I would say we are generally seeing an improving environment one that we can not only be opportunistic, but I think, continue to drive to our strategic objectives at the same time. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Tom Joyce : Is this the author? Is this the author? Scott Davis : Well, no comment. I should have done it under a pseudonym, I guess that are anonymous. I\u2019d get less hate mail. Tom Joyce : I have gotten through the \u2013 I have gotten through the introduction. I didn\u2019t get directly to the Danaher chapter, but thank you. Welcome, Scott. Good morning. Scott Davis : Well, thanks, Tom. It\u2019s very kind. But hopefully the book helps you sleep at night, couple of pages, and you are out like a light, but anyways, I \u2013 lot of good detail already and you just talked a little bit about M&A and what do you envision Tom in the next kind of 12 months, I mean, this is a strange environment. Is it a better environment for bolt-ons? Is it better environment to take bigger bets like you did with Cytiva? Is it \u2013 I mean, just a little bit of color around that just given how strange things are right now? Tom Joyce : Yes. Well, first of all, Scott, I think over the next 12 months, I think we will see without any question an improving environment from an M&A and capital deployment perspective. I mean, we all know that, March, April, I mean, things were essentially locked down in to great extent people were frozen in place in many different ways. And so there is no doubt that you come off of a situation like that. And I think we will see improvement. We are already seeing a little bit of that already. I would say normally what happens particularly on the back of a very large acquisition, like Cytiva that we have done, you have historically seen us do more, small, mid-size bolt-on acquisitions to our platforms. And I know the teams are working actively on those. Some of those smaller situations can get a little unhinged here in an uncertain environment and that tends to serve us well. But also in terms of just the way we manage our resources internally, on the back of a big deal, we tend to do a few smaller deals. Now, all that being said, when the balance sheet is as reinforced as it is right now, we are in much better shape than we might have been had we not done the equity offering and had the tremendous advantage of the current free cash flow certainly that Cytiva has helped with. So, in general, I think we can be pretty balanced in our approach. I mean, obviously, Cytiva was outsized, but I think we can be pretty balanced in terms of taking advantage of an improving environment. Matt McGrew : And Scott, it\u2019s Matt. Maybe put some numbers to the context of what Tom just talked about, we have got pro forma EBITDA, this year, that\u2019s going to be close to $6 billion. And as of right now, we are less than 3x net debt to EBITDA. So to Tom\u2019s point, we have got some flexibility to be aggressive with larger or the smaller stuff. Scott Davis : Yes, for sure. So, natural follow-on just again, in the context of this is kind of a strange environment and you have got amazing growth rates in so many of your businesses, how do you integrate Cytiva for the long-term, I mean, in this environment. And I mean, really specifically, bringing in DBS tools and really culturally, I mean, bringing the best of the Danaher culture kind of into that organization even obviously talk about standing it up as kind of a decentralized business, but how do you do it and is it at all delayed at all? And you don\u2019t want to kind of disrupt the business flow right now given how high the growth rates are or is it already begun and you are really, it\u2019s similar playbook is maybe your past acquisitions? Tom Joyce : Yes. Scott, we have had to \u2013 we have certainly had to be creative in this environment. And I think we have been able to do that, I will describe what I mean by that here in a minute, but obviously with the restrictions on travel and being and what would normally be very much a face-to-face environment with a newly acquired business, particularly a new one, we have had to come up with new and different approaches to achieve the same objectives in the early going around DBS orientation and getting a business off to a great start. So, I think this all starts with the fact that the Cytiva business brings with it to Danaher really an exceptional team of people. We got to know them unbelievably well during diligence. Certainly, we had a whole year to regulatory approvals to get to know one another. We have gotten a sense of their command of the business, their ability to drive performance, their focus on continuous improvement, the level of humility they bring, all of which sets up for a team and a business that adapts very rapidly to a Danaher environment, because they are so culturally like us right at the outset. Add to that the fact that the team reports indirectly to Rainer. Rainer will continue to have that team report directly into him. And he has maintained that relationship and continued to build those relationships and bring the tools and processes to that team on a virtual basis. So, we have gone through what we call ECO. You have heard of that before executive champion orientation, a lot of that very familiar to that, that team because they are well down field in a number of the tools and processes of DBS. So, yes, we also have some of our teammates going into that, that business and that obviously further accelerates the DBS orientation. So, net-net, the combination of using virtual, our electronic and digital tools to conduct DBS training and orientation and communications along with having an outstanding team already, plus some folks from Danaher going into that business. We can safely say right now, we are very much on track to where we would like to have been if we were in a face to face environment. Scott Davis : Okay, good. Thanks. Congrats, Tom, congrats, Matt and good luck for the rest of the year. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Scott. Matt McGrew : Thank you, Scott. Scott Davis : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Tom Joyce : Good morning, Doug. Doug Schenkel : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Starting with another one on Cytiva, your growth, even excluding COVID-19 was definitely a bit above your deal model assumptions of course, the role you are playing in advancing COVID Solutions helps the growth profile as well it is early but I am curious how these trends impact your view on Cytiva accretion and returns longer term, especially given the early and pronounced non COVID strength? Tom Joyce : Well, Doug, I will start with the top line and then Matt will jump in with how we see that that flowing through when you are accurate, it they are off to a start that is better than what we anticipated in the growth model. You heard us talk to numbers that were in the in the 10% range. And that core growth in 2019, if you go back to that was about in that range. And yet as we came into this year, they came in with a strong order book, good backlog, and then you had the COVID impact on top of that and so when you then kind of separate that you see there what you might say there non-COVID base business growth being in the mid-teens and the COVID volume obviously taking that volume growth over 20%. So, I think the key message there is this is a business as a base business put COVID aside for a second that is off to a phenomenal start that continues to lead in its market and is continuing to build the order book day in and day out. Doug Schenkel : That\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s actually a good second question. In your remarks, you have commented on Cytiva and the Pall Biotech order book, your order book looks like for capital equipment. It\u2019s like the recent [Technical Difficulty] of airtime in the Q&A today but it\u2019s clearly better than expected [Technical Difficulty] end market, some momentum building in academic research, but in both categories, it seems like consumable and service were well equipped for them. So the reason I am asking about the broader order book and answer it however you want, of course, but I am just wondering if you think there is pent up capital demand heading into the second half and if there is evidence that this could start to turn into revenue over the course of the year? Tom Joyce : So Doug, there was a part of that question. Early on that we did not catch. It broke up, but I think we definitely caught the back end of your question. So I am going to hit that assuming we didn\u2019t miss anything at the front end, which was really around you are talking about consumables and service versus equipment in my prepared remarks, and you were asking about pent up capital demand. And I think the simple answer to that question is, yes, there will absolutely be some pent up capital demand in a number of different areas. I might site one example if I turned to our Environmental applied solutions business segment and I look at a Videojet in PID, while you have our consumables business tracking really well, we have seen much more weakness in our in the equipment side of Videojet. But we know over a long period of time that equipment has a lifecycle and requires replacement, it requires a certain level of maintenance. You certainly had an expanded utilization of much of that equipment, as consumer packaged goods, volumes have grown. And so I would, very much expect to see that fuse one example that Videojet equipment start to track back in short order, I think ditto on as labs reopen in the life science market. We are going to see some improvement there. And in fact, we have dialed some of that improvement in even the third quarter as we start to see labs reopening we are going to see some of those orders that would have normally flowed through in the first and second quarter come through in the third. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Matt McGrew : Yes, Doug, this is again \u2013 Doug it\u2019s Matt again. I started just kind of put some maybe some numbers in context to the overview Tom gave. I mean, you saw here in Q2 our order book grew nearly 10% from an order perspective. So, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s an encouraging sign to what Tom just talked to and we have got the core business, if you will, without the Cytiva \u2013 or sorry without the COVID tailwinds was down kind of 3% here in the quarter. And as Tom just mentioned at the end, we are sort of anticipating because of that nearly 10% order growth, I think you will see an improvement of that, minus 3% sort of going to flat here in the quarter. Doug Schenkel : Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. I will try to sneak in one last one just a clean up question, hopefully you can hear me okay now. In the second quarter, you delivered adjusted earnings growth that was 70% or so higher than reported revenue growth, is it fair to think that it\u2019s going to be lower than that in Q3 as the mix starts to evolve a bit more towards capital and as you are ramping some of the opportunistic investment you described earlier in this call? Tom Joyce : Yes. I mean, maybe the way to think about kind of the third quarter and VCM, etcetera. I mean, it is a little tricky. I think you do need to sort of look at the core business that is, Danaher ex-Cytiva, maybe the way that I think about it is that from a fall through perspective, that Danaher non-Cytiva piece is probably going to have a 30% to 35% variable margin on it fall-through if you will as we do make some of the investments we have talked about in Cytiva and elsewhere. I think if you then include the assumptions around Cytiva, put those in, I think that sort of gets you from an EPS perspective sort of south of where we were here in Q2, but probably closer to what I think we are going to end up with. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thank you again. Tom Joyce : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Steve Beuchaw : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time here. Tom Joyce : Good morning. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Hoping you could just put a little bit of perspective on in terms of the recovery trajectory and then I had one less exciting model question. There are two things that we have focused on the call here where we have good reason to be at least directionally optimistic about how things evolve. One is vaccines, in the vaccine space, while it\u2019s certainly tough to know exactly how it\u2019s going to look and how big it\u2019s going to be. It would be really helpful if you could just give us a little perspective on what the slope of the curve looks like. If we are at ex today which is a sort of preliminary investment in scaling up in anticipation of vaccines, when we get out to \u201821, is it still X or is it X x2 or X x3? What does that look like? And then the other ramp related question I was going to ask actually relates to healthcare utilization. So, Tom, you gave some really helpful commentary on how people are getting back to getting healthcare to some extent in doc office settings to some extent in hospitals, that\u2019s encouraging, should we take this to mean you feel good about this sort of dovetails off of Doug\u2019s question, but the ramp for hardware spend on some of the Beck DX and Leica products that might have been under a little bit of pressure in 2Q, do we get that back starting in 3Q or given everything that\u2019s going on the hospitals to take a little bit longer? Thanks so much. Tom Joyce : Yes, you bet. So, your broader question started out with recovery trajectory and I want to just hit one quick theme and then I am going to get your question about vaccines. One of the key things we haven\u2019t really touched on this call, even though I mentioned it in my prepared remarks on the recovery trajectory was China. We saw a significant improvement in our China business over the course of the second quarter. And if you looked at that, the breadth of that improvement that span not just across Life Sciences and Diagnostics and not just across, Cytiva and Pall, but \u2013 or Cepheid, but our other businesses like Beck LS and LMS, our EAS businesses like Hach and Videojet, all performed extremely well in China benefited from the kind of trajectory of recovery that we are seeing broadly there and across the board, delivered positive low single-digit growth in China in the second quarter. So that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s an important dynamic of this recovery trajectory that we haven\u2019t really touched on today, but let me get to the core of your questions. In terms of the vaccine multiples, again, yes, you are right. It is, as I said earlier, very hard to gauge. But at this point, I mean, you are talking about a really high multiple of volume versus today. Let me give you an example. I mean, today, all of these \u2013 all of our revenues associated with this are in the early stages of Phase 1, Phase 2, early stage human trials, small volumes etcetera. I mean, we are nowhere near the stage of talking about tens, let alone hundreds of millions of doses of either a vaccine or a therapy. And so, again, hard to put a number on it, but I can only say it\u2019s certainly a high multiple of where we are today, but with a lot of variables attached to how high that number is. Relative to your question about healthcare utilization, I think the simple answer is yes, we will be seeing an improvement in the hardware equipment side of the house and yes, it is associated with Beckman Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems\u2026 Steve Beuchaw : Brief musical interlude. Tom Joyce : Brief musical interlude maybe that was associated with the recovery in healthcare utilization, but the issue has been not just around healthcare utilization relative to equipment, but it\u2019s really been about the fact that in a COVID-19 environment, access to hospitals in any area whether it\u2019s the reference lab area, anatomical pathology, microbiology, access to those labs for hardware installations has been limited, if not in certain cases, zero. And so just as we are seeing academic and research labs opening up on the life science side, as we have started to see hospitals opening up a bit relative to elective procedures and overall utilization, we are now starting to see our ability to get in and install equipment that\u2019s in the order book come along. So we will see some improvement there. It will take some time for that to happen, because hospitals are still highly restricted in their access. But as we go into late this year and early next year, we will start to see that return to a more normal growth rate. Steve Beuchaw : Okay, that\u2019s incredibly helpful. I know we are top of the hour here. So I will take my financial question offline. Really appreciate all that. Tom Joyce : Okay. Thanks so much. Matt McGrew : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks everyone for joining us today on our call. We are around all day for questions. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Crystal. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today\u2019s call, our third quarter 2020 Form 10-Q and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until November 5, 2020. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the third quarter of 2020 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings and actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher\u2019s overall core revenue growth profile, we are presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales, references to core revenue growth, including Cytiva sales and the calculation of period-to-period sales growth comparing to current period Cytiva sales to the historical period Cytiva sales prior to the acquisition. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well, thanks Matt and good morning, everyone. We delivered an outstanding third quarter with results in the mid-teens core revenue, over 60% adjusted EPS growth and more than doubled our year-over-year free cash flow. This strong performance is a testament to our team\u2019s dedication as they stay focused on executing for our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to support patients, our customers and the global community. So, before we run through our third quarter results, I\u2019d like to update you on how we are directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. Cepheid continues to be a leader in the global diagnostic testing effort and the team\u2019s commitment to tackle this global health crisis was further demonstrated by the recent launch of a rapid 4-in-1 combination tests for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar, but the treatments differ greatly. And this test will provide clinicians with critical answers in approximately 35 minutes to help ensure the best patient outcome. Now, as we head into flu season, we believe Cepheid\u2019s easy-to-use rapid 4-in-1 test will be a critical tool in clinicians testing arsenal and we are incredibly proud of the Cepheid team\u2019s fast and innovative response to the pandemic. We further enhanced our diagnostic testing capabilities with Beckman Coulter Diagnostics\u2019 new IgM serology and IL-6 assays. The IL-6 assay can help identify severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, a crucial consideration as clinicians evaluate the risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation. The IgM serology assay can detect IgM antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop shortly after symptoms appear and it\u2019s complimentary to Beckman\u2019s IgG tests, providing greater insight over the course of a patient\u2019s infection and immune progression. While the use of COVID-19 antibody testing is relatively limited today, in the future, it may play a critical role pre and post-vaccination for population surveillance and clinical trial studies. We are also proud to support the scientific community\u2019s pursuit of new vaccines and therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva\u2019s products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway globally, including every Operation Warp Speed COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. As the market leader across the bio-processing workflow, the breadth of our offering and technical expertise are key differentiators that enable us to contribute meaningfully to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. So, now, let\u2019s take a look at our third quarter results. We generated $5.9 billion of sales with 14% core revenue growth. COVID-related revenue tailwinds contributed approximately 1,000 basis points to third quarter core revenue growth, while our underlying base business was approximately up \u2013 was up approximately 4%, a sequential improvement from an approximate 3% decline in the second quarter. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up mid-teens led by North America and Western Europe. High growth markets were up approximately 10% driven by sequential improvement in China and India. Our gross profit margin was 54.8% and our operating profit margin of 18.5% was up 80 basis points. Our core operating profit margin was up 310 basis points, with each of the three segments achieving 75 basis points or more of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.72 were up 62% versus last year. We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.5 billion year-to-date, up 110% and 59% respectively, with 174% free cash flow to net income conversion in the quarter. This outstanding cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. We also continue to accelerate organic growth investments across Danaher, with a particular focus on expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva, and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand driven by COVID-19. So, now, let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 18.5% led by core growth rates of 20% or more at Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences, and more than 35% at Cytiva and IDT. We are continuing to see strong demand from customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities and from our biopharma customers working on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. In our more instrument-oriented life science businesses, declines moderated as academic and research labs continued to reopen, driving increased installations and better order trends. SCIEX benefited from this improving environment achieving low single-digit core revenue growth driven in part by demand for new products, such as the Echo MS and the Triple Quad 7500, the most sensitive mass spectrometer on the market. Moving over to diagnostics, reported revenue was up 18% and core revenue was up 17.5% led by more than 100% core growth at Cepheid as a result of COVID-19 testing volumes and record GeneXpert System placements. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks continue to resume throughout the quarter. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segments, reported revenue and core revenue were down 1% with similar results at both our water quality and product identification platforms. Across our water quality businesses, municipal activity and projects continued to resume driving growth in North America and China and this was offset by softness in the industrial end-markets globally. Demand for our consumables and chemistries remained steady, supporting customer\u2019s mission-critical day-to-day water operations and equipment declines moderated and we were encouraged by equipment order trends in the quarter as more customer facilities got back up and running. Now, during the quarter, Hach closed the acquisition of Aquatic Informatics, a leader in water-focused software solutions. Aquatic Informatics Solutions collect, manage and analyze large volumes of water data and these capabilities combined with Hach\u2019s deep applications expertise, will help us bring greater operational efficiencies to customers\u2019 workflows. At our product identification platform, low single-digit core revenue growth at Videojet was driven by strong demand in North America, particularly across the consumer packaged goods, food and beverage and pharmaceutical end-markets. Consumables and services performed well globally as Videojet continued to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic. Now with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let\u2019s take a look at recent trends across our end-markets. Geographically, customer activity continues to increase in the U.S. and Europe as phased re-openings proceed across these regions. We are keeping an eye on areas that have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, but we have not seen any material impact so far. And China is progressing well with activity in most regions approaching pre-pandemic levels. Within Life Sciences, bio-processing demand continues to lead the way, COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity increased meaningfully during the quarter with development and production scale of occurring at an accelerated pace. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprised most of our bio-processing exposure and collectively these businesses increased orders by more than 60% in the quarter, driven by our comprehensive offering across the bio-processing workflow. Non-COVID related bio-processing activity remains healthy and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters. Now, as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs around the world are continuing to reopen at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people allowed in the lab at any one time and we estimate that approximately 60% to 70% of academic research labs are now open in some capacity. And in China, that number is closer to pre-pandemic levels. Moving to clinical diagnostics, we continue to see strong demand for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point-of-care settings. Since launching the first rapid molecular tests for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped more than 7 million test cartridges in the third quarter. The team continues to ramp test production and we now expect to ship more than 8 million tests in the fourth quarter. Cepheid also delivered another record number of new systems in the third quarter expanding their market leading global installed base by approximately 35% over the past year. Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes increased through the quarter as elective procedures and wellness checks resumed across much of the developed markets. We estimate that global patient volumes are currently 90% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels, with China slightly ahead of North America and Europe given its earlier reopening. In the applied markets, consumables remain solid as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food, medicine and consumer products. Previously delayed equipment installations are starting to resume and we are seeing our equipment order books improving as customers start to initiate new project and capital investments. So as we look ahead, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter, modest sequential improvement across our businesses will be offset by the impact of 3 fewer selling days versus last year, which represents a core growth headwind of more than 300 basis points. We anticipate COVID-19 related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. So to wrap up, we are really pleased with our results this quarter and we are proud to play a pivotal role in tackling COVID-19 head on. Our team has turned unprecedented challenges into tremendous opportunities and our strong performance is a testament to our associates focused execution and commitment to our customers. With the Danaher business system as our driving force and the powerful combination of our talented team, exceptional portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, we believe Danaher will continue to outperform through the remainder of 2020 and well into the future. Now, before I go on to the Q&A, I just want to take a moment to share a few thoughts after my initial month as CEO. First, I always knew we had an exceptional portfolio and extraordinary team and that conviction has only been reinforced over the last few months as I have had the opportunity to spend more time with more of our businesses and leaders. And in doing so, a couple of things really stand out. One is the considerable amount of innovation happening across the organization. Our investments in R&D and commercial initiatives are allowing us to continue building sustainable competitive advantages all across our businesses. The other standout for me is the caliber and the depth of talent we have across Danaher. Our associates are innovative and passionate about their work and committed to the Danaher business system and our culture of continuous improvement. It\u2019s clear that DBS is what drives it. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s how we do what we do. It\u2019s our ultimate competitive advantage. And I see it alive and well, everywhere. So, our future is bright and I am excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. I believe that the combination of our investments and innovation, outstanding team and strong balance sheet all powered by the Danaher Business System, will enable us to keep building an even better, stronger company as we move forward. So with that, I will turn the call back over to Matt. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Crystal, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line that Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Rainer, 50% order growth in Pall Cytiva was certainly impressive and a notable acceleration from last quarter. So, could you maybe just touch on the manufacturing scale-up you alluded to and how quickly can additional capacity come online and where are you making those investments? Rainer Blair : Sure. So, first of all, good morning, Tycho and thanks for the question. As I think about the larger opportunity here, particularly in the vaccines and therapeutics, it might be helpful just to backup one second and think about the scale and the breadth of our unique portfolio. We are incredibly well-positioned through the combination of course of Pall and Cytiva, but also upstream with many of our companies being involved in the development of the actual drugs themselves. And then of course the process scale-up, the upstream solutions, including cell culture media, single-use bioreactors and then all the downstream fluid management filtration and chromatography solutions. And so I think what you saw there and that step up here, quarter-over-quarter was the breadth of that portfolio and the capability of those teams really moving forward and gaining traction, we are on top of well over 400 vaccines and therapeutics that are in the pipeline and we are playing in the great majority of those in one capacity or another. And so, the nature of our portfolio, the focus of our teams, the trust that the customers have in us is giving us an extraordinary number of add-backs. And so as you think about that portfolio positioning here, going forward, we think that as the capacity needs of our customers continue to ramp, certainly as we think about \u201821 and beyond, we expect to play very, very well there and just to give you a sense of that, we year-to-date have $1 billion, well over $1 billion of COVID-orders in the combination of Cytiva and Pall Biotech. And that\u2019s before any vaccines have been officially approved by the FDA. So again, we really see an opportunity here for the long term to really capture an extraordinary amount of opportunity and share going forward. Tycho Peterson : Great. And then maybe I guess a similar question on Cepheid. I know you have been committed to scaling up the manufacturing there and you talked about 8 million tests in the fourth quarter, but can you talk about where you think that needs to go from a capacity standpoint? And any headwinds we need to think about from a lighter flu season here for you guys in the fourth quarter and early next year? The flu trends early on are still kind of light. Thanks. Rainer Blair : So. just to level set on that one, Tycho, we have had extraordinary demand for our COVID tests here from Cepheid. In fact, you noted in my comments that in Q2 we had 6 million tests shipped; in Q3, 7 million tests shipped; and now in Q4, we are looking at 8 million tests shipped. And we also at the same time, at the end of September, launched this 4-in-1 test, which really positions us uniquely and extraordinarily in order to be able to address the opportunity and the need in particular here as the flu season arrives. As you can imagine, as patients present, particularly in hospitals and points of care, that physicians will want to know the right answer quickly and the right answer needs to distinguish between COVID and the flu season. So we are really thinking of this as the flu season and COVID testing both being tailwinds as we go into Q4 and beyond. Matt McGrew : And maybe just to put some numbers around that for you. So, if you think about sort of the capacity that we talked about at Cepheid, sort of to begin this, in Q2, we sort of had 6 million tests that we had. That increased to about 7 million here in Q3. And we expect that to go in Q4 to call it maybe closer to 8 million. And as we sort of ramp through \u201821, we are going to be adding additional capacity as well. Now, I am not sure exactly when we expect all of that to come online, but as that happens, we will sort of kind of keep people updated. But yes, for sure, we are going to add a little bit here in Q4 and then throughout 2021 as well. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll hop off and let others step in. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Hey, good morning. So, just to\u2026 Rainer Blair : Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Follow-up on \u2013 hi, just to follow-up on Tycho\u2019s question, just because I am getting some pings from investors. How are you thinking about pricing on the 4-in-1 test? And I mean, when we have done some calls with labs, I think there is some concern about how they are going to get reimbursed for some of these multiplex tests. Can you sort of talk through pricing and sort of like what\u2019s \u2013 what is the strategy for your customers to get paid for these? Rainer Blair : Sure, sure. So, let\u2019s start off with, just to level set that we in fact have launched this 4-in-1 test here in September and are already shipping. And we are seeing great customer demand for that. So, customers are really recognizing what an incredible tool this is at the point of care and hospital, to be able to diagnose and help customers. Now, this test here \u2013 and, of course, this always depends on the type of customers. But the 4-in-1 test will be priced right around $55 to $60 per test, and that compares to the COVID-only of about $20 to $40. Once again, depends on the type of customer and volumes and so forth. But that gives you a sense of it. Now, from a reimbursement perspective, we feel very good about this for a number of reasons. As the 4-in-1 test is a multiplex test and that is going to be so useful for clinicians to determine what type of treatment will be suitable for that particular patient. And then \u2013 so, as you think about that, today already there are multiplex tests being used for respiratory type ailments and they are used all the time. And so, we see that our customers are very familiar with the reimbursement dynamics here and don\u2019t see any issues as it relates to the Cepheid 4-in-1 multiplex test. Derik de Bruin : Great. Matt McGrew : Derik, maybe just to give you a little bit of context, sorry as well on some numbers on that, on that 4-in-1, obviously, it\u2019s got a higher price point, like we talked about. But just to make sure that we kind of level set on how we think about when that will come online. So, I think in Q4, thinking about maybe 60% of our test volume in Q4 is going to be COVID-only. And then the other 40% would be the 4-in-1. And I think the way to kind of think about that is that when you think about \u2013 we are still going to be producing COVID-only, and the kind of staggered adoption because \u2013 one, you have got high growth markets that really don\u2019t experience seasonal flu. So, the demand for that is just not going to be as high if any. And Europe is going to be more of a staggered adoption. It is going to be country by country, it\u2019s not going to be kind of uniform like it might be in the U.S. So, just maybe to think about from a modeling perspective, that split would be the way I think about that. Derik de Bruin : Great. And the \u2013 I guess on that one \u2013 well, actually, let me follow-up on something else. And so, I guess, can you talk a little bit about the pacing in SCIEX and academic labs? I mean \u2013 and basically the \u2013 talk about are you see any signs of any increased activity in terms of like a fourth quarter budget flush? Just sort of like the end market dynamics and sort of what is going? I mean, you talked about labs being open, but what is really the spend potential there, and just sort of like what does the, sort of, customer spending environment look like? Rainer Blair : Sure. So, Derik, we have seen lab activity around the world pick up. As we mentioned, we see China nearly at or at pre-pandemic level. And I would say in North America and Western Europe, we see those lab capacities at about 70% to 80%, which is a sequential improvement, and we saw that. And so, our teams are able to now get in to see the customers to install the systems, provide the services and so forth. But we still see some capacity limitations, as I mentioned earlier, related to social distancing measures and so forth. Now, having said that, in Q3, our tools business grew 10%, we are very happy about that. And that was driven certainly by IDT and Beckman Life Sciences, but also by new product launches which were incredibly important for us and our customers, for instance the Echo MS, which is the high throughput screening tool used in front of mass spectrometers which has been seeing an extraordinary uptake. The launch of the Triple Quad 7500, I mentioned that. That is the most sensitive Triple Quad on the market, seen great uptake for that. And that\u2019s driving \u2013 that actually drove a positive low-single digit growth already for SCIEX in Q3. And then at Leica Microsystems, we had recently launched the Stellaris, a confocal microscope, which is the most versatile and powerful confocal microscope in the market. So, this combination of certainly sequential improvement in the marketplace, more labs being accessible, us being able to get in and install and provide services, has been helpful. But I think we have also been buffeted by these aggressive new product introductions that we have invested in here too for the future. Derik de Bruin : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Rainer Blair : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : Good morning. Good morning, Rainer. Welcome. Rainer Blair : Thank you. Scott Davis : Hey, Rainer. Anything the board wants you to do kind of differently than your predecessor, anything to focus on differently? Rainer Blair : That is a great question. And right now, I would also like to take this opportunity to start out with thanking Tom and the Board and all the associates for the fantastic transition that they have provided me here over the last months and getting me off to what is a great start here for Danaher in Q3. So, I have worked for Tom a decade, and with that, of course, also with our Board. And what you can expect there is a great deal of consistency and continuity for sure. And my plan, of course, is to build on the fantastic foundation that Tom and the board, have laid and making us a stronger science and technology company, and you will see that I am very passionate about the topic of innovation. You heard me comment on that today already as well as talent. And so, you will see us to continue investing here quite significantly in innovation and in our talent, in our scientific capabilities, whether those be internal or external, as we continue to chart our course here forward as a leading science and technology company. Now, having said that, with all the similarities, you can also expect to see no change as it relates to our capital allocation bias, which will continue to focus on M&A and, particularly, on making us a stronger innovation and growth company as we continue to move forward. And when I started this role, just after we had closed the Cytiva deal, I thought that perhaps I would be sitting here with the ability to make some smaller deals, but certainly, initially with the balance sheet, I mean, some rebuilding. And we find ourselves here in a great situation and that \u2013 one, our free cash flow is stronger, Cytiva\u2019s performance is even better than expected and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how the team is transitioning and being a part of Danaher. And then you add the equity raise to that, and that\u2019s really put us into a situation where we just have more degree of freedom. And so that from an M&A perspective also puts us in a position of being able to do certainly small and medium sized strategic deals, and then as we go forward, get back into a stronger position pretty quickly. Scott Davis : That\u2019s helpful, Rainer. Is Aquatic the type of deal that we should expect going forward? I am not sure you guys sized that. Maybe you could help us understand if that\u2019s material or not? Matt McGrew : So, yes, Scott, \u2013 I can give you a little color on at least the size of it. I mean, this is a deal in water for the Informatics, and Rainer can talk a little bit about it. But it\u2019s a pretty small deal. I mean, it\u2019s a sub-$20 million in revenue and profitability, call it, $80 million to $100 million type deal, kind of deal for us. So, it\u2019s not huge. Rainer Blair : But it is exemplary of the deals that we continue to like. It\u2019s nothing new. You have seen us do technology deals here that strengthen and round out our portfolio and we like Aquatic Informatics positioning and capability. So, certainly, you will see more of those types of deals and we consider that a smaller one. Scott Davis : Perfect. Well, good luck to you Rainer. We wish you well. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Rainer Blair : Hi, Doug. Welcome. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to go back to Tycho\u2019s first question on capacity build out. How do you balance the desire to fulfill acute RX and vaccine development demand related to the pandemic with the outlook for post-pandemic demand? I mean, I guess to be more to the point, do you believe the capacity you are building today will continue to be used even post-pandemic and thus, should we view the elevated revenue levels associated with your build out as being durable even after the surge in pandemic-related demand subsides? And I guess well on this topic along those same lines, you are placing a lot of GeneXperts today. They are going to be used for the foreseeable future as much as people can get those, at least in our opinion just given what\u2019s going on. But post-pandemic, how do you think about the durability of these placements and the associated revenue potential? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Doug. What I would like to do is take your question and even broaden it a bit to let you \u2013 to hear how we think about the long-term here. And the way we frame that is, what does the world look like post vaccine versus what the world for Danaher looked like pre-vaccine or pre-COVID, call it. And let me start with our base business, through the portfolio moves that we have made and the investments, have already been transitioning to a higher growth and earnings profile with a higher degree of recurring revenues. And so, we feel very good about the growth profile that we had pre-COVID where we were already a 5% to 6% grower. And to your point, it\u2019s included in that with Cepheid growing at low-double digits at the time, representing about 5% of our portfolio. And at that point we didn\u2019t even own Cytiva yet, although we were thinking, as we were diligencing and going to close that this would be about a 6% to 7% grower. So, as we think now about a post-vaccine world, we actually really believe that our core growth is going to improve. And why is that? Well, first of all, our base business will continue to improve as activity picks up and markets recover and our innovation investments, some of which I talked about earlier, start paying off even more. But then also to your point, Cepheid, it might be back to low-double-digit and it will represent 10% of our portfolio in 2020, with what we think are some of the most durable testing revenues in the marketplace. Because we are at the point of care, because our workflow is so easy, because of the menu breadth we have with both multiplex or COVID, we really see this point of care positioning as unique. And then you add on top of that, and you mentioned this, our increase in the installed base, 35% increase over prior year just in 2020, we really see this as a long-term improvement. Then you add to that Cytiva, which we are seeing now with the leading positions in cell culture media, single use technologies, including bioreactors, filtration process chromatography and many more things, that we are getting so many add backs with these over 400 vaccines and therapeutics in the pipeline that we see an extraordinary potential there for the traction and the capacity increases that are needed for the future, independent of the type of vaccine that will ultimately receive approval. And so, we think that that 6% to 7% growth assumption that we had here prior to the pandemic was likely conservative, and that for the long-term we really can think high single-digit there as well. Then lastly, you see our capital allocation strategy which is biased toward M&A. You add that on top here. And we really do believe that our growth profile as a result of the pandemic and the durability of our positioning in the aftermath of all of that is going to result in a higher growth profile. Now, there\u2019s lots of things here to consider in terms of macro risks, think of government spending, taxes, there are a number of variables here. So, it\u2019s a little bit early here to be conclusive. But what we see here is fundamentally stronger and more durable growth profile going forward. Doug Schenkel : Super helpful. And then just one more quick follow-up on, I think, it was one of Derik\u2019s questions. Just keeping in mind how strong your business has been this year, it seems pretty clear that you are going to be in a position to get your debt-to-EBITDA ratio down in the neighborhood of 3x by the end of this year. You referenced M&A here in answering my last question. How ready is the organization for M&A given everything that\u2019s going on? But \u2013 the balance sheet is clean, but there is just a ton of demand on your infrastructure. So, I am just wondering how you would characterize your M&A readiness right now? Thank you. Rainer Blair : It\u2019s a great question. First of all, speaking to the balance sheet, I think you are in the right neighborhood there, that those are numbers that we could confirm based on the free cash flow and the EBITDA that we see in our current debt profile, that our balance sheet is in a very good position. I would also say, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the progress that we are making in the transition of the GE Biopharma business, now Cytiva, into Danaher, and they are firing on all cylinders and we continue to extricate ourselves there from the transition services that GE provides us and standing up this organization and see just extraordinary, not only efforts but real results there. So, we always, at Danaher, maintain leadership and management capacity to ensure that the opportunities that we generate, that the market provides us, we can take advantage of. And so, while we are transitioning Cytiva into Danaher and nearly complete with that, that doesn\u2019t keep us from being ambidextrous here and keeping our eye and being able to take advantages \u2013 take advantage of the opportunities that market provides. Doug Schenkel : Okay, great. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter here. Rainer, maybe a question on our Cytiva, no surprise, but if I look at how the Q played out, so Cytiva was 500 basis points of contribution in 3Q and I am looking at the order trends which is accelerating. Maybe talk about the Q4 guidance here, which implies a modest step down here for Cytiva. Is that a timing element or perhaps flesh out why contribution perhaps steps down in the context of accelerating orders? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Vijay, and good to hear you. So, Q4 Cytiva, perhaps it\u2019s helpful to back up and come back to what Matt was talking about earlier. It\u2019s really important to see that we continue to expect a similar growth tailwind from COVID in Q4 as we did in Q3, and we expect our base business to perform similarly or incrementally better. But it is important to keep in mind that we had three working days less, and particularly for the consumer-oriented businesses that\u2019s been impactful in the calculation. And having said that, if you think about the bioprocess industry today, already these companies are producing vaccines. So, if you think about operation work speed and where BARDA is involved, not only are the biopharmaceutical companies producing clinical trials quantities, they are already ramping up capacities for those vaccines that they see \u2013 vaccines and therapeutics that they see very near to approval and are hopeful for. And of course, this is financed oftentimes through the federal government. And so, there\u2019s a great deal of aggressiveness there. And so, that\u2019s already happening here at the back end of Q3 and you will see that also in Q4. And then as approvals start coming in, and we are hopeful that that happens at the end of the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, then I would expect to see an additional ramp there as well. Matt McGrew : Vijay, maybe just as a kind of some context around it, I mean, we have talked about sort of year-to-date we have got north of $1 billion of COVID orders between Cytiva and Pall Biotech. The way to think about that is that those are orders that we have already gotten, that are booked, probably 50% of those orders are going to ship here in 2020, but the rest are going to move to 2021. Just to give you some idea of sort of how that order book is played out and it\u2019s going to move its way through the P&L, like Rainer was just talking about. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful, Matt. Rainer, one more follow-up on that, you spoke about the order book. As vaccine manufacturing ramps up, do you need to make incremental investments? And I am just thinking about incremental margins here. It\u2019s been really strong the last two quarters, mid-40s, well above historical trends. How should we be thinking about spend levels and incremental margins? Because I am assuming travel steps up as the economy reopens. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Yes. So, Vijay, I will start here and then I will pass it on to Matt. So, first of all, we absolutely are and continue to invest in capacity expansions. In fact, we were in the capacity expansion program at Cytiva as we brought the company into the Danaher fold and are, of course, accelerating that. And you can expect additional investments here in Q4, that are capacity related certainly but also related to standing up the organization. And then as we continue to go into 2021, you will see continued investment, and of course that has \u2013 that plays out in our margin assumptions as well. And I think, Matt, you were just about to jump in on that. Matt McGrew : Yes, I think for Q4, I think you are right, Vijay. We have seen sort of Q2, Q3, we have had really good fall through on the growth. I think as we sort of look at Q4 though, I think probably a 30% to 35% fall through is a better number to use. Like you said, we kind of, as we look at where that\u2019s come from in Q2 and Q3, and we have had some really, really good mix, on where the growth\u2019s come from Pall Biotech, think about Cytiva and Cepheid. And now that some of the other businesses are contributing more, I think we are going to have a bit of a mix impact. And then as you mentioned, the lower OpEx and less travel and trade show is certainly a part of it. Things are sort of getting going again as you saw with the growth rates. And then, Rainer talked about the accelerated growth spend we are going to do that in Q4. We have got some projects already that we have got underway. I think that will have an impact on it. And probably lastly frankly, we are \u2013 given where we have seen some of the growth and we have got some pretty outstanding growth in, for example, Cytiva, for example, Cepheid, there is going to be some sort of year-end accruals, if you will, on around bonuses and things like that. It will be a bit of a headwind year-over-year for us. So I think it probably moderates a little bit here, as we get into Q4 from where we have been, but still feel even with that, I still think we are going to be able to put up some pretty good EPS growth here. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful context. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Dan Brennan : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So I know you just kind of outlined the $500 million plus or so for the vaccine opportunity or therapeutics for your biologics business, I am just wondering if you can kind of raise the scope up a little bit higher and just help us think through ultimately like the addressable opportunity for Cytiva and Pall just given the magnitude of therapeutic and vaccine development that\u2019s ongoing. So, it\u2019s nice that you got the orders in hand, but kind of how big is the market you feel that you are addressing as we look out for both vaccines and therapeutics related to COVID? Rainer Blair : Dan, that\u2019s a great question. And let me refrain just a little bit and give a little bit of background on this topic. It\u2019s so important to remember that there are very different types of vaccines. In fact, there are a number of unknowns here that still makes very solid and defined projections, pretty challenging. You know there is a lot of questions around which kinds of vaccines and therapeutics ultimately get approved and we have seen more recently with Lilly and J&J that these approvals are not given, these are rigorous processes that these companies go through with the FDA and there are number of wildcards, including adverse reactions and so forth, that at any given time can derail efforts that we think are very close to the finish line. So, it\u2019s really important to understand that prior to approval, picking what are the future \u201cwinners\u201d is very difficult. The other thing that\u2019s also hard is that these vaccines are produced in very different ways. While there are a number of similarities, how they are produced is very, very important in terms of the amount of doses that you get per batch as an example, which can materially and by orders of magnitude change the kinds of inputs that are required for any production. We also have a lot of questions around the number of doses. Is it going to be a one-time shot with a booster for life or is it going to be much like we see for influenza, an annual type injection that everybody needs, these are big questions that of course affect any kind of estimates that you make. And then lastly, there is a great deal of discussion about to what degree will the population actually accept vaccines and use them and get vaccinated in order to get to that ultimate goal of herd immunity. So, we see that \u2013 we see that it\u2019s very, very challenging to come to a good number there. But having said that, as we get closer here in the next month and perhaps quarter or so, we will start seeing approvals were very helpful. And this picture will become much more clear as we get the data out of the clinical trials, know about doses, whether booster shots are required and that sort of thing. And then I come back to what Matt said, if you look at the $1 billion that we have year-to-date in orders, we see that prior to FDA approval, so we certainly feel very positive about what the future holds here in the next year or so, but again coming down to hardcore and highly defined numbers, it\u2019s tough. Matt McGrew : Well, and remember too, Dan, that, that 1 billion is for orders that we have got today as of the end of the third quarter. So while Rainer sort of talking about you guys are talking about what\u2019s the opportunity as we go forward sort of longer term, anything that we have here in the short-term in Q4 from an order perspective, we will just keep adding to it. So sort of the near-term, I think we still have some upside here as we get kind of into Q4 and then as the vaccines get approved and then as we start to learn some of these unknown variables that we can start to give you guys a bit better kind of view of it. But so far, I think it gives you a frame of what we have got. We have got the Q4 how that plays out. And then as we know more, I think as we get into early next year, we will probably have a better frame for you hopefully to get some clarity on that. Dan Brennan : Great, thank you. Thanks for that. And then maybe just one more on Cepheid, I know you have kind of addressed it a couple of times, but I think there is similarly a moving target to figure out how testing evolves, particularly related to COVID as we get into 2021 with a vaccine and as potentially, there is a lot more testing done as point-of-care and you know the kind of the rapid antigens and much cheaper faster alternatives. So anyway, to give us just an early sneak kind of framework to think about how we should be contemplating Cepheid as we look out to \u201821 under some of those scenarios, because I think you are in the interesting position where you are not the kind of batch-based [indiscernible] kind of sitting between two different areas. So any color on that would be great? Matt McGrew : Yes. Sorry, go ahead, Rainer. Rainer Blair : Yes. I was just going to say that, Dan this is a really critical question, right. Lot of people talk about the antigen tests and most of those are used in different care settings are the Cepheid solution, GeneXpert that is used at the point of care in critical care environments and in the hospital when speed, workflow and accuracy really count. So, those clinicians on the basis of that test are going to make a call as to what therapy they prescribe. So, it has to be right, it just has to be right. And so that\u2019s why the GeneXpert and the Cepheid testing approach is the gold standard. And that\u2019s why we see that really as a very, very durable testing modality that is at the right place at the right time with the right answer at the right cost for the system. And we expect independent of the number of infections that we see other types of modalities really breathing either higher or lower depending on the infection rates. But as you think about the point-of-care hospitals, in particular and other point-of-care settings, that\u2019s what we see this gold standard, along with this multiplex 4-in-1 test to have an extraordinary amount of durability. And we see that right and you see us continuing to ramp up from 6 to 7 in the fourth quarter, 8 million and you can expect more tests per quarter as we go through 2021. So I feel very strongly about the unique and durable positioning of our Cepheid, GeneXpert approach. And add on top of that is the fact that we have increased the installed base by 35% this year, that really puts us in a very strong position and that installed base continues to grow. Dan Brennan : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Rainer Blair : Hi, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good morning. I am not going to ask about COVID testing or bioprocess just to be clear. I was going to ask one on China and one on Beck Dx, I will just ask both here and then jump back in queue. One is I wonder if you can put more granularity on the growth in China, how it progressed through the quarter and any areas of comparative strength and weakness of acknowledging of course that it\u2019s all recovering right here, it would be helpful just to get that regional perspective and to the extent you are comfortable talking about where that might sit in 4Q? And then I will go ahead and ask my second question, which was actually on Beck Dx, which we generally touched on here in the Q&A. I wonder if you could talk about the capital side, what your expectations are given DxA is now available in some regions I believe how you think about capital in Beck Dx prospectively? And then to the extent you have a window on it given that you have that business in the broader diagnostics platform, how are you planning for, for the fourth quarter and next year, as it relates to some of the specialty testing categories that are so important in hospital settings both for this business and then for just getting folks back into the hospital to get the kind of care they need, whether it\u2019s related to cardiovascular or other specialty settings and I will apologize now for the very longwinded two questions and get back in queue? Thank you. Rainer Blair : No worries. Thanks, Steve. Well, let\u2019s start with China. China has been an extraordinary story as you all know in terms of the speed of the recovery and what we see as unique with China is the breadth of that recovery. So, not only do we see of course extraordinary return to lab capacity, which are nearly or at a pre-pandemic level, we also see the return of patient volumes and to some degree approaching normality. And what\u2019s unique about China is that we also see this in our more industrial businesses. So, the recovery in China in contrast to North America and Western Europe is broader based. And so as you think about our EAS portfolio or some of the businesses we have industrial businesses we have with Pall, we are seeing very nice recovery there. And like we said, in China we saw, essentially, 10% growth here in Q3, and we expect to see acceleration of that here in Q4 as well, as that economy continues to build momentum. And that\u2019s really across the portfolio. Now, as we think about Beckman Diagnostics and our business there, we\u2019re really pleased by the performance and the return of patient volumes here in the developed market. Those have really exceeded our expectation, and the team has done very, very well in continuing to grow that business, innovate in that business. You heard about the IL-6. You heard about IgM on top of IgG. So, we have a great deal of momentum here and our innovation cycle times have been shortened and accelerated very significantly. And as we think of capital, we\u2019re starting to see our funnel pick up in the discussion also around capital equipment placement. No doubt they are not yet at the level of what we saw prior to the pandemic, but they certainly are better than what we saw in Q2 and earlier in Q3. And so, those conversations are starting to happen. Also differently to what we saw in Q2, and this will be something to monitor, as we see COVID hotspots continue to pop around \u2013 pop up around the world, is that for now we haven\u2019t seen anything that on the margin impacted in the patient volume return; meaning, that we see wellness testing and elective type procedures continuing to ramp and not be significantly impacted yet by some of these hotspots, so cautiously optimistic here that the progression that we have seen for Beckman Diagnostics and more generally with patient volumes, continues to move forward positively. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks for the perspective there and welcome to the call here, Rainer. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Steve. Appreciate it. Operator : We have reached the end of the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back to our presenters for closing remarks. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Crystal and thanks everyone for joining us today. We are around all day for questions. Rainer Blair : Thanks everybody. Stay safe and healthy.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well, thanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. Before we go through our fourth quarter and 2020 financial results, I wanted to take a moment and reflect back on the past year. As we all know, 2020 was the year that brought many unforeseen challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While our contributions and testing, treatment and vaccination have helped with the global effort to combat COVID-19, there is still much more progress to be made to overcome the pandemic. It's also not lost on us that part of our financial performance in 2020 was driven by the work we're doing to tackle a health crisis which has had such a devastating impact on so many around the world.  That being said, we're also very proud of our contributions to fight the pandemic. And we'll continue to work tirelessly to support these global efforts in 2021 and beyond, as necessary.  So, as I look back on 2020, I'm most struck by our associates' teamwork, dedication and invaluable contributions during these difficult times. They are truly making a difference in the world. And since the onset of the pandemic, our team has met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to help our customers, patients and the global community. Their efforts have been both humbling and inspiring.  I'd also like to recognize and thank our customers, suppliers, and business partners, many of whom we called upon for additional support to continue meeting demand throughout this pandemic. We're incredibly grateful and won't forget their collective efforts over the past year.  One of our five core values at Danaher is the best team wins. And I believe we truly saw that in action in 2020.  So with that, let's turn to our 2020 financial results. For the full year, we delivered nearly 10% core revenue growth, 170 basis points of core operating margin expansion, 43% earnings per share growth, and over $5 billion of free cash flow.  We also closed the largest acquisition in our history, welcoming Cytiva team to Danaher in March of last year. Cytiva is a global leader in bio processing and has played a major role in supporting the development and production of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics. In 2020, the business generated more than 25% core revenue growth and over $4 billion of revenue. We couldn't be more pleased with Cytiva's early results, all driven by a highly talented, engaged and innovative team that has embraced the Danaher business system.  So, now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results. We generated $6.8 billion of sales with 15.5% core revenue growth and believe we continued to capture market share across many of our businesses through accelerated investment and new product innovation, enhanced commercial execution, and by deploying new engagement techniques, new customer engagement techniques during the pandemic. COVID related revenue tailwinds contributed approximately 1,200 basis points to core revenue growth, while our underlying base business was up approximately 3.5%. Geographically, we saw broad-based and consistent revenue growth during the quarter. Developed markets were up mid-teens, with similar growth in both the US and Western Europe. High growth markets were up low double-digits, driven by another excellent quarter in China.  Our gross profit margin was 58.5%. And our operating profit margin of 23.7% was up 390 basis points, including 360 basis points of core margin expansion. Our outstanding margin performance was driven by a combination of higher core revenue growth and the impact of the Danaher business system on productivity and operations across all of our platforms. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.08 was up 63% versus last year. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.4 billion for the full year, up 134% and 79%, respectively.  Our free cash flow to net income conversion was 149% for the full year and marks the 29th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher. The combination of our cash flow generation and strong balance sheet gives us more degrees of freedom earlier than anticipated after the Cytiva closing and positions as well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. Given our strong margin and cash flow performance, we took the opportunity to accelerate investments and high impact growth initiatives across Danaher, including innovation and collaboration projects.  We're also expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand for COVID-related testing and treatments, while positioning the businesses for continued long-term growth.  So, now let's take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences reported revenue increase as a result of the Cytiva acquisition, with core revenue of 18.5%, led by core growth rates of 30% or more at Cytiva, Pall Biotech, Beckman Life Sciences, and IDT.  We continue to see strong demand from our biopharma customers during the quarter and our non-COVID related biopharma business was up double digit, and we also saw an acceleration in activity focused on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. We also saw customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities to support the development and production of COVID-related tests and treatments.  In our more instrument oriented Life Science businesses, order trends and installations improved as academic and research labs continued to reopen.  SCIEX benefited from this uptick in activity and delivered mid-single digit core revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by demand for new products, such as the 7500 Triple Quad and the Echo MS.  Moving over to diagnostics, reported revenue was up 23.5%, with core revenue up21.5%, led by more than 100% core growth at Cepheid, driven by elevated COVID-19 testing demand and GeneXpert Systems placement. Cepheid achieved a significant milestone in December, the passing $2 billion in annual revenue just one year after hitting the $1 billion mark. It's a tremendous accomplishment by a fantastic team. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, both delivered high single digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks steadily resumed through the quarter.  Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue was up 2% and core revenue was up 1%. Our water quality platform delivered low single-digit core revenue growth and product identification was down slightly. Across our water quality businesses, we saw solid demand for our consumables and chemistries as we continued to support customers day-to-day mission-critical water operations.  Equipment declines moderated as more customer facilities got back up and running. And by end market, municipal activity and project continued to resume and industrial declines moderated. ChemTreat delivered its 52nd consecutive year of core revenue growth in 2020, an impressive accomplishment in any year, but even more so given the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic.  Across our water quality platform, the team's focused execution, combined with our innovative offering and the positioning of our portfolio, enabled the water quality platform to achieve positive core revenue growth for the full year. At our product identification platform, positive results in our marking and coding businesses were offset by moderating declines in packaging and color management. Consumables and services held up well globally as we continued to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic.  So, with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let me give you some color on the trends we're seeing across our end markets and geographies.  Customer activity around the world remains broadly consistent with what we saw back in October and through the fourth quarter, and we expect this relative stability to persist near term.  Despite rising COVID infection rates and new targeted lockdowns in certain regions, customers are adapting to working in this new pandemic environment and we have not yet seen a material impact on demand. Within Life Sciences, COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity continues to drive record bioprocessing demand. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise most of our bio processing exposure, and their combined order growth in the quarter was up more than 50%.  As a market leader across the bio processing workflow, our teams are playing a significant role in the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, while working to ramp up manufacturing capabilities on a massive and very compressed timeline.  We are involved in the majority of more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects underway globally, including all of the vaccines in the US that have recently received FDA emergency use authorization or are in late stage clinical trials. We're very proud of our team's tireless efforts which will directly impact the lives of so many people around the world. From where we stand today, we estimate the 2021 revenue opportunity associated with COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics at Cytiva and Pall Biotech will be approximately $1.3 billion, roughly twice the amount we recognized in 2020. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity remains strong and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters. Turning to our other life science end market, and as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs are continuing to reopen, albeit at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people in the lab at any one time.  In clinical diagnostics, heightened demand continues for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point of care settings. Since launching the first rapid molecular tests for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped approximately 9 million test cartridges in the fourth quarter. As anticipated, approximately 60% of the respiratory tests shipped in the fourth quarter were COVID-only tests and 40% were four-in-one combination tests for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV.  The team also placed a record number of new systems in 2020, increasing Cepheid's installed base by more than 35% year-over-year to over 30,000 instruments globally, and reinforcing its market-leading position in molecular diagnostics.  Cepheid's differentiated offering and leading presence at the point of care position the business to help meet customers testing needs in 2021 and beyond. As a result of this strong positioning and the elevated COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates we are still seeing today, we expect to ship at least 9 million tests per quarter for the duration of 2021.  Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes remained steady as elective procedures and wellness checks continue at a similar pace as we saw through Q4. We're closely monitoring patient activity in areas that have recently implemented new lockdowns, but we've not seen any material impact at this point.  During the quarter, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics expanded its COVID-related test menu with the addition of a high volume antigen test. This automated test is designed to run on Beckman's immunoassay analyzers and can help address the challenges associated with scaling up antigen testing to make higher volume mass testing possible.  Beckman's automated antigen test is another important addition to our COVID diagnostics offering and a testament to the Beckman team's strong cadence of innovation, having launched six new COVID related tests in as many months. Finally, in the applied markets, consumables remained solid as customers sustain essential business operations, like testing and treating water and safely packaging food and medicine. And we're encouraged to see sequential improvements on the equipment side as customers initiate new project and capital investments.  Looking ahead now to the first quarter and full year 2021. We expect to deliver mid to high teens core revenue growth in the first quarter. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will contribute approximately 1,300 basis points to core revenue growth, with mid-single digit core revenue growth in our non-COVID related businesses.  For the full year 2021, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth, with growth moderating sequentially in the second half of the year as a result of tougher prior-year comparisons. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will contribute approximately 500 basis points to core revenue growth for the full year, with mid to high-single digit core revenue growth in our non-COVID related businesses.  So, to wrap up, 2020 was an exceptional year for Danaher. Our team took the challenges presented by the pandemic and turned them into opportunities to support customers across all of our businesses and also directly contribute to the fight against COVID-19. We're all humbled by our associates efforts and believe that Danaher's future is bright, thanks to their dedication.  2020 was also a transformative year for Danaher, with the addition of Cytiva. This was one of several strategic portfolio moves we have made over the last few years to build a better, stronger company, and establish Danaher as a global science and technology leader.  Looking ahead, we believe the combination of our talented team, excellent portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher business system, positioned Danaher to outperform in 2021 and beyond.  So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Maria, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of J.P. Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Nice quarter. Rainer, I'm curious if you could talk about the sustainability of the Pall, Cytiva order book as you lap tougher comps. I know you talked about the $1.3 billion in revenues tied to COVID vaccines, but question is more on kind of the order book and then timelines for the manufacturing capacity expansion you alluded to. Rainer Blair : In terms of the sustainability of the order book, the way we're thinking about this, and we've mentioned this at J.P. Morgan as well, is about \u2013 we're looking at a backlog here of about $1 billion coming into the first quarter and we expect the total year to have COVID-related sales of about $1.3 billion. And that's really based on the approved vaccines that we see out there in the marketplace, as well as the volumes that we see related to clinical trials as it relates to other vaccines. So, we think that we have good sustainability and strong backlog here to be able to make sure that we cover that $1.3 billion. Additionally, and coming back to your capacity point, we have been expanding capacity continuously, even prior to the close of the transaction we had agreed with GE to continue capacity expansion. We had then, after the close, continued to invest whether that with Cytiva, Pall Biotech or elsewhere in order to make sure that we are able to meet our customers' demand, and that will continue to occur here through the year 2021 and beyond. Tycho Peterson : For McGrew, one on just the margin dynamics here. As we think about Cepheid, 9 million tests a quarter and then Cytiva, Pall continued to kind of trend at these levels, what were the margin implications between these two tailwinds in your view for the year? Matt McGrew : Tycho, maybe the way to think about it is that it helps to kind of sustain a similar margin profile to what we've seen before. So, maybe if you think about from a fall through perspective on the core growth here for 2021, and frankly for Q1 as well, we are sort of assuming we are going to see about a 40% or so fall through, like I said, for both Q1 and 2021. Now, that's down slightly from what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters. But I think we want to stay aggressive in what we've been doing on the growth investment side, one. And two, we are starting to see a little bit of inflationary pressure, particularly around freight and a little bit in the supply chain as well. And then, China also is \u2013 we've got some targeted lockdowns, as you know now. But in the fourth quarter, we really saw China sort of having inter-country, if you will, travel be pretty significant. They're moving \u2013 they're moving around quite a bit and getting back at it.  So, I think we're sort of thinking instead of maybe the levels of fall through we've seen, it might be more like 40%. But again, I think we will be able to hopefully sustain something like that, given what you talked about, which is pretty good margin profile, both those businesses that will continue to be pretty strong here next year. Tycho Peterson : If I could ask one more before I hop off just on M&A. Rainer, it seems like you're telegraphing a desire to do something more meaningful. Any incremental color you could provide on willingness to do a larger transaction and any framework you can talk about? Rainer Blair : It's great to be able to talk about M&A here in January of 2021 having just closed the Cytiva deal. And no question, between the better performance that we've seen out of Cepheid \u2013 I'm sorry Cytiva, as well as the equity raise that we've done and the free cash flow that we've seen, we definitely see more degrees of freedom here earlier than we've had. But we still have work to do here with Cytiva, standing them up as an operating company, and we'll always be in the game, but likely more focused on smaller to mid-size deals here for now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : I guess just following up on Tycho's question on the margins and just sort of thinking about the bottom line. You didn't give an EPS guidance for 2021, but is there any reason to think that something in that $1.90 to $2 range on a quarterly basis isn't sustainable for the rest of the year? Matt McGrew : I think I'd kind of go back to take your 40% VCM and the fall through and whatever revenue assumptions you sort of put in, I think the math would kind of take care itself. Derik De Bruin : One big question that's coming up from investors is thinking about instrument placements in the diagnostics area. Obviously, not only has Cepheid placed a ton of instruments, but a lot of your competitors, all your other companies selling molecular diagnostic tools have placed enormous numbers of instruments. Are you worried that there is going to be a glut of machines out there that don't get used, or are you being very selective in sort of like where you're placing it? The question is like, what's going to be the follow-on demand once we're sort of past COVID for your installed base? Rainer Blair : Our instrument placements as we think about Cepheid, we have placed now and have an installed base of over 30,000 instruments, growing that over 35% here in the year 2020. And we've been very thoughtful about the placement of those instruments. First of all, and helping here during the pandemic and making sure we have those at the point of care where diagnostic decisions are being made and the answer has to be fast, and it has to be right, and the Cepheid GeneXpert is just a perfect solution for that.  At the same time, we've been thinking about those placements for the long-term. You may be aware that Cepheid has the largest molecular diagnostic menu in US with over 20 tests and outside of the US with over 30 tests. And so, we've placed those instruments primarily there, where we see that even in a post-COVID world, they would find great utilization based on the full testing menu. Derik De Bruin : Just one cleanup question or just one follow-up question. How should we think about the EAS segment in 2021? Rainer Blair : The EAS segment has been improving sequentially here throughout 2020. And we're really pleased with the fact that water quality in particular has had positive growth, but also PID was essentially flat here in 2020 as well. And so, we see that recovery, and we will continue to see that recovery here as we go through 2021 and expect them to be in the mid-single digit range, not only as the consumables remain solid as they have been, but as those instrument placements which have been in moderating decline start picking up, as we've seen these customer projects in our funnel. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a solid print here. Rainer, maybe I'll start with some of the base business here, right? The assumptions here for the guide in a base business at mid-singles and obviously the comps were pretty easy in 2020 given the disruptions. And I look at the Q1 guide here, mid-to-high teens, you guys just at mid-teens inclusive of days impact. Correct me if I'm wrong. It feels like the base business is accelerating here in the Life Science, particularly it seems to be growing double-digits in the back half of 2020. I'm curious what's driving that acceleration in base Life Sciences in the back half of 2020 and why is the guide assuming mid-singles for 2021? Rainer Blair : Vijay, that's right. We have seen a sequential acceleration of our more instrument-related life science businesses as labs have continued to open. They've been able to work out their social distancing protocols. They are not up to full capacity yet, but they certainly have been improving and that's given us more lab access to continue installations and of course bring the service business back online. So, that's been continuously improving and we would expect that trend to continue here in 2021.  Now, as we think about the guide here, mid-to-high teens, look, we have our base business there at mid-single digits, which is 100, 150 basis points acceleration as well as the COVID tailwind accelerating here to 1,300 basis points. So, we think we're well placed there.  And just as a reminder, we've got a couple of working days less also in the first quarter of 2021.  And then lastly, as it relates to the COVID tailwinds, keep in mind that Cepheid already last year in the first quarter had a very strong quarter as physicians were trying to rule out flu, if you will, with more flu testing in the absence of an actual COVID test. Vijay Kumar : One for Matt. Matt, I know you said the 40% incrementals, we can do the math, but I just want to clarify, I'm getting to north of 28% operating margins for fiscal 2021. Does that seem ballpark \u2013 in the right zip code for you guys? Matt McGrew : Yeah. Again, if you think about the fall through at kind of 40%, there are some moving pieces here below the line, but they largely offset each other. So, I think it is pretty straightforward that whatever your revenue assumptions are going to be that that should be a pretty good way to think about. Where we land on that I think will dictate where you come out on the bottom for sure. Vijay Kumar : Rainer, one last quick one for you, please, on the high volume antigen test. I know you sort of mentioned in your press release about screening opportunity. Is that an upside in the model here for the guide or how should we think about up high volume antigen tests? Rainer Blair : The high volume antigen tests, you're right, we just launched that here in December. And in fact, that will be available on our installed base of about 16,000 instruments. So it is a broadly applicable test for us here in our installed base at Beckman.  Having said that, we've been very moderate in our planning assumptions here as it relates to including higher volumes of antigen test until it becomes much clear on how those will be applied here, not just under the Biden administration in the US, but throughout the world as people start setting standards as to what the test results for antigens mean from a diagnostics perspective, but also in terms of how you might think of large volume serial testing for schools opening up and other institutions. Vijay Kumar : Congrats again guys on the impressive print here. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Just one nitpicky question. On E&AS, is there a meaningful difference between the incremental leverage on the recovery in water versus product ID? Rainer Blair : Not really, Scott. Those businesses are pretty similar from a fall through perspective. Scott Davis : Like 35% to 40% ballpark? Rainer Blair : I think that's a great place to be. Scott Davis : Okay. And then when you guys were thinking in terms of like the four-in-one versus \u2013 the four-in-one take rates, the 40% number, is that kind of uniform around different geographies or is there a particular higher take rates in different geographies around the world? Rainer Blair : Scott, so it actually does differ by geography. Let me see if I can do something about the echo here. Can you hear me okay now? Scott Davis : I can you hear you fine. Rainer Blair : Okay. So, that differs by geographies, particularly in the US, you are looking at 60% COVID-only and 40% of the four-in-one. In Asia, in fact, there is a real pressure for the COVID-only test as the flu is not as prevalent there and as seasonal. As you go to Europe, here we increased adoption of the four-in-one, but that's a little staggered as the improvement by country roll in. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Maybe just a quick follow-up on an earlier guidance question. It looks like you're assuming a two-year stack base business growth of around 5%. That doesn't seem to imply a full recovery as we think about the steady state for your portfolio. So, just to be clear \u2013 and I think we know the answer to this, but I just want to confirm it, seems like the philosophy for this year embed some assumption for continued recovery in line with recent trend that's based on backlog, but not a full reopening over the course of the year. Rainer Blair : Doug, that's exactly how we're thinking about it. We are still in the middle of the pandemic, as we all know. And while we're hopeful that things get better as the vaccines rollout and the adoption there improves, we are not expecting 2021 to be a year that is, if you will, a post-COVID herd immunity year. This is going to continue to be a transition year and probably not quite back to the pre-COVID rate. Doug Schenkel : Pivoting quickly back over to Cepheid, I believe, Rainer, that you said that the guidance assumes Cepheid should continue to sell around 9 million assays per quarter in 2021. It doesn't seem like that's reflecting any potential capacity increases. I just want to make sure that's the case. And if so, why? And then kind of building off of that, is the expectation that the mix of kind of COVID only and four-in-one test will remain kind of in that 60/40 ratio? Rainer Blair : Let's start with the first one. And as you may know, we in Q2 of last year shipped 6 million, 7 million in Q3. We were planning to ship 8 million cartridges here in Q4 and we were able to exceed that by shipping 9 million. So, as we think about our capacity improvements, which we continue to work on, we do not yet have those in place. And in view of the pretty dynamic situation, also as it relates to the actual pandemic, we think it's a good planning number to take the 9 million cartridges here per quarter for the full year. And of course, as we continue to work on, and we are working on and investing in capacity increases, we'll provide further updates.  Now in terms of the mix, I think that is a good planning assumption, the way you're thinking about that, with 60% COVID-only tests and about 40% of the four-in-one test. That's how we're thinking about it as well. Doug Schenkel : Just one last one. I just want to dig in on your comments regarding capacity expansion within bio-processing. Presumably, at some point, you're going to be well positioned to transition-out the building COVID-19 capacity over to other large molecules. You were building that out even in advance of the pandemic, as you've mentioned in your prepared remarks. So, do you think that bio-processing revenue can be sustained at 2021 levels even when we look forward to the day where vaccine and therapeutic tailwinds related to COVID-19 abate? Do you think there is an air pocket or a sustainable demand that trends enough to support revenue at least at 2021 levels? Rainer Blair : Well, when we look at that pipeline of drugs and vaccines, so therapeutics and vaccines, that are not COVID-related as well and it's chockfull, it continues to grow and that business has been very, very solid. So, there's a couple of things here, Doug. One we expect that pipeline to be very relevant to the capacity that's being traded today. In fact many of our investments are nearly pulling forward things that we had planned for several years down the road. That's kind of one point. But the second point is that, it also looks as though vaccine manufacturing will be with us for some time, not only as it relates to COVID, but as you think about the bolus of investment that is now gone into biotech companies that are looking at new vaccine technologies to get at diseases where we've yet to develop vaccines. We do see increasing number of projects there as well. So, as it relates to this incremental capacity, we feel really good about where we're positioned, got the right portfolio and we think our utilization is going to be very strong. Matt McGrew : Yeah, just to give you a little bit of color around kind of the capacity side and maybe tying that back to how we're thinking about the sustainability of what we're seeing today, I think as Rainer said, as everything he just kind of laid out, when you think about what we've seen in the core base biopharma business, we've seen last three or four quarters here where we've got a low double-digit kind of core growth, and that's even probably a little bit above where it was a couple of years ago, given everything Rainer just said.  Now when you put on top of that what we've seen here on the vaccines and therapeutics, still lot of unknowns obviously going forward, but you're looking at, as we talked in Q2 and Q3, the order growth at Cytiva was well north of 50 and it was north of 50 again in Q4. So, I really think we've got good sustainability as we head into 2021, given the backlog, given what we saw in order growth in Cytiva in Q4 and given the base business, sort of going low-double digits. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Steve Beuchaw : I actually wanted to rewind almost all the way back to the beginning of your prepared remarks, Rainer, and a point that you made about accelerating investments in innovation and collaboration. It's one of the sort of high-quality problems that has emerged for companies that are part of the solution around COVID. I wonder if you could talk us through how you've gone about identifying areas to make those investments. And if you could flag for us any particular areas of emphasis, I'd really appreciate it. And I do have one follow-up. Rainer Blair : The way we've been thinking about these growth investments is very broad across our portfolio. We've always looked at this as an opportunity to strengthen our capabilities and exit the pandemic stronger than we entered, whether that's in businesses that are benefiting from COVID tailwinds or businesses that are not in that particular application. And so, what we do is we work together with our teams to identify where the most attractive projects are, not just on a return perspective here in the near-term, but also strategically positioning us for competitive advantage and then we will invest aggressively in those and that's been the case here for several quarters now. So, we'll continue to do that. Steve Beuchaw : Look, a lot of good questions have been asked about margins, earnings and the businesses. I'll try to round it out a little bit and just ask about core Beck Dx. I wonder if you could give us a perspective on where you are with the DxA rollout in the replacement cycle and to what extent COVID has impacted that. I could see it having some puts and takes. So any perspective on how that's going and what you're thinking about for core Beckman \u2013 core Beck Dx, I should say, for 2021, would really appreciate it. Rainer Blair : I was just going to say, we've just launched the DxA and we couldn't be more pleased with the initial interest in that. But if we back up to the Beckman Diagnostics business for a second and see how that's been performing, we've continued to see sequential improvements here quarter-over-quarter and practically every region and couldn't be more pleased with the way, in fact, that business has positioned. You were speaking earlier about these kinds of growth investments that we're making. Well, we've just launched the hematology analyzers along with the DxA for the DxH's 9000 and 5000, as well as just launched six new COVID-related tests. So, that's just an example of your first question also as it relates directly to Beckman Dx. So, we've been tracking exactly what we wanted to hear with the DxA and that's been really going well for us.  Matt, did you want to add anything there? Matt McGrew : Yeah, I just wanted to sort of address the question of what we thought they'd do from a growth perspective here in 2021. And I think we're sort of thinking that as the rebound continues a little bit with the patient volumes, we expect them to be up sort of high-single digits here for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on expectations around capital equipment. So, you obviously ended the year on a strong note, but just given some of the recent flare-ups, do you think that sustains as you go into the first half of the year? Rainer Blair : Jack, you are right. We have seen the capital equipment purchases picking up here. As labs open up, that's increased. And then we close very strong here. We saw that in many of those instrument type businesses in the end of Q4, with some high-single digit performance there. In fact, we continue to see that. We've pulled our businesses and customers and they're learning to work around the pandemic with the necessary social distancing measures. And we continue to see that accelerating here going into 2021 and we see that also reflected in our guide here for both Q1 as well as at a low double digits for 2021. Jack Meehan : I know you've given a lot of color already on bioprocessing, but one follow-up just on the expectations built into the guidance. So, you have it roughly doubling the $1.3 billion from COVID tailwinds in 2021, but that kind of looks like you're annualizing the benefit you saw in the second half. So, is there anything \u2013 maybe just talk about how you see the demand playing out throughout the year. And is there anything tailing off maybe on the therapeutic side? What are you assuming there? Rainer Blair : As we think about the bioprocess order book, recall that we had orders growth at Cytiva and Pall Biotech of over 50% here in Q4 and that was a further acceleration from what we had seen and we expect that acceleration here to continue. So, our backlog position is really strong. We entered the year with $1 billion and we are confident that that $1.3 billion of revenue are really solid.  But that also had some assumptions behind it, which is, here we are supplying the approved vaccines, as well as those that are in clinical trials. And you know we're well positioned not just on the vaccines in Project Warp Speed, but the over 400 projects that you have both vaccines and therapeutics. So, as you think about 2021, while we do expect a moderation in the second half of the year, that's entirely related to more difficult comps as opposed to a trailing off of the actual absolute demand. So, we believe that that will continue. Matt McGrew : To give you some sense, Jack, on how that order book is going to flow through, we saw at Cytiva and Pall Biotech, in the second half of the year, we grew, call it, north of 35%. We've got that backlog position now. Some of what you said, some of it came in during the year and booked and shipped in the year to give us 35%, but we're going to get off to a pretty good start here at Cytiva. Q1 core growth in Cytiva is going to be probably north of 50%. So, I think we'll have a good strong start. Let's see how that order book sort of develops through the year as more vaccines and therapeutics sort of make their way through the systems to the approvals. But that's sort of how we've framed it as we stand now with kind of the $1.3 billion opportunity. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe just a quick one, more high level on a geographic basis. China, I think was low double-digits in the quarter on a core growth basis. Can you just talk about the pace of the recovery there, which markets are growing strongly? And then also, just the expectations baked in for 2021 on that front? Rainer Blair : As you say, we did see a very nice recovery in China here, both in Q4, as well as what we're planning here going forward. So, low double-digits in China in 2020 and that's really across the businesses. So, we saw that both in our Life Science and Diagnostics businesses as well as in EAS as China has really ramped here, not just in the healthcare sort of related businesses, but also in the applied markets.  And as you look forward to 2021, starting with Q1, we expect our businesses to be over 50% in China in terms of the growth in Q1. So, really getting out of the gates there very strongly. Of course, they had a lower comparison there in Q1 of 2020.  And as we think about the full year, we really see China in the mid-teens. So very solid performance, very strong recovery after a full year, which really came in at the low-single digit. So, 2020, China low-single digit; 2021, mid-teens, speaks to a strong recovery there. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe just one more on Cepheid. I know it has been touched on a few times. But I guess as you think about kind of the sustainability of that $9 million a quarter, how are you thinking about the overall, I guess, COVID testing market in the back-half? Are you assuming that shrinks and Cepheid gets a bigger piece?  And then, on the back of that, do you see point-of-care becoming more and more important as we go here and maybe this ends up being a positive inflection point for this as a piece of the market on the go mode? Thank you. Rainer Blair : Looking to point-of-care here, and COVID testing in general to the second half, it's very hard to forecast right now how COVID testing will play out in the second half. Just because as we think about vaccines rolling out, we're already now talking about a variant, who knows how many more of those will occur. And of course, often the dialog tends to be about what's happening in the US, but, in fact, other places around the world are not vaccinating yet at that rate or even don't have vaccines yet. So, we think that that planning assumption of 9 million per quarter is a very solid planning assumption.  And then, as it relates to Cepheid in particular, at the point-of-care, you may have heard this concentric circle metaphor, but point-of-care is really at the center of that in terms of the durability of that testing for the long-term because that's where the doctors need fast turnaround time, that's where they need an accurate result because they're going to make a therapeutic decision. They're going to make a decision as to what happens next. And the outer portions of those concentric circles are the ones that have increasingly less durability as the general public becomes vaccinated and, over time, although it's going to be interesting to see whether that's achieved in the second half of the year, whether herd immunity is even relevant.  Keep in mind, herd immunity is not something that happens in a country. The whole world is a petri dish here. And if we continue to travel, interact with each other, there is a high likelihood that high testing volumes will continue for some time. Operator : And that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. Thanks, Matt. Thanks everyone for joining us here today. And we'll round our day for questions. Rainer Blair : Thanks, everybody. Thanks, Maria. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Lori. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until May 6, 2021. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the first quarter of 2021, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices, which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile, we're presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. References to core revenue growth includes Cytiva sales and the calculation of period-to-period sales growth comparing the current period Cytiva sales to the historical period Cytiva sales prior to acquisition. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of 2021, we got off to a very strong start, delivering better-than-expected core revenue growth across our portfolio. Our broad-based performance was driven by double-digit core revenue growth in our base business, our ongoing contributions to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics and strong demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular diagnostic tests. Our record top line performance also contributed to outstanding earnings per share growth and free cash flow generation. Our well-rounded first quarter results are a testament to the unique positioning of our portfolio and our commitment to continuous improvement. We have an exceptional collection of market-leading franchises and technologies all powered by the Danaher Business System, that serve attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term competitive advantage. So with that, let's turn to our first quarter results. We generated $6.9 billion of sales in the first quarter with 30% core revenue growth. All three of our reporting segments delivered better-than-expected growth, led by Life Sciences and Diagnostics. We believe we continue to capture market share, particularly at some of our larger businesses, including Cytiva, Pall, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, Hach and Videojet. Over the last several years, we've prioritized high impact growth investments in innovation, sales and marketing, to ensure that we're well positioned both near and long term. Through new product introductions and the impact of our Danaher Business System growth tools, we've enhanced our competitive advantage and believe we've achieved notable market share gain. Geographically, revenue growth was broad-based across both developed and high-growth markets. We saw over 20% growth in the developed market, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up more than 45%, largely driven by the recovery in China. Our gross profit margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 62% in the first quarter, largely due to higher sales volumes and the positive impact of higher-margin product mix. Our operating profit margin of 29.1% was up 1300 basis points year-over-year, including more than 900 basis points of core margin expansion as a result of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses, as we continue to see limited travel and other related costs. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.52 were up 140% versus last year. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 135% year-over-year. Now in the first quarter, we deployed more than $400 million of capital towards mergers and acquisitions across all three segments. Most notably, IDT and Cytiva completed their first bolt-on acquisition with IDT adding Swift Biosciences, which brings complementary capabilities and a broad portfolio of next-gen sequencing library preparation and enrichment solutions for DNA, RNA and methylated DNA samples. And Cytiva acquired Vanrx Pharmasystems, which provides innovative, automated aseptic tolling technologies used to fill vials, syringes and cartridges, a critical final step to complete the bioprocessing workflow. We also continued to make significant organic investments and high-impact growth initiatives across all of Danaher. Over the past six months, we've invested in a meaningful expansion of production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva, Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences. Near term, these investments will support COVID-related demand, but they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses, where we see tremendous runway ahead given the underlying growth drivers and the durability of the markets they serve. Between these four businesses, we're investing more than $1 billion in 2021 to continue to meet our customer\u2019s needs today and well into the future. So now let's take a look - a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 115% as a result of the Cytiva acquisition, and core revenue was up 41.5%. We saw strong double-digit core revenue growth across all of our largest operating companies in the platform, led by Cytiva, Pall Life Sciences, Beckman Life Sciences and IDT. In our bioprocessing businesses, accelerating demand for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutic development and production drove a combined core revenue growth rate of more than 60% at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Excluding the impact of COVID-related activity, our underlying biopharma business grew in the low 20s range. We believe that our ability to continue meeting customer\u2019s needs across their bioprocessing workflows enabled us to gain market share in the quarter, particularly within our cell culture media and single-use product line. Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 34%, and core revenue grew 31%. Each of our largest operating companies in the platform achieved high single digit or better core revenue growth, led by Cepheid, which achieved more than 90% core revenue growth. In response to the unprecedented demand for Cepheid's rapid point-of-care molecular test, the team again increased production capacity and shipped over 10 million respiratory test cartridges in the first quarter. Roughly half of the tests shipped were COVID-only tests, and the other half were 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19 Flu A, Flu B and RSV. We also saw increasing demand for non-respiratory tests across Cepheid's market-leading test menu, including sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and urology, demonstrating the broad applicability of Cepheid's molecular diagnostic offering. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 6.5% and core revenue was up 3.5%. Our Water Quality platform was up slightly and product identification was up high single digits. Our Water Quality businesses support customer\u2019s day-to-day mission-critical water operations, providing water testing, treatment and analysis across a variety of applications around the world. We saw good underlying demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables during the quarter, and we're encouraged by the improvement in equipment sales, which returned to growth as customers got back up and running at more normalized levels. In Product Identification, we saw mid single digit core revenue growth in our marking and coding businesses and double-digit growth in packaging and color management. Esko and X-Rite benefited from the underlying market recovery and saw good momentum from customers initiating new projects and investments in the first quarter. So with that context from what we saw by segment during the quarter, let's take a look - walk through some of the trends we're seeing across our end markets and geographies. Customer activity around the world is approaching pre-pandemic levels as we all collectively adapt to working in this new environment. We're seeing this in the form of strong sales funnels and order book growth. Service levels at or near pre-pandemic levels and an uptick in equipment revenues. While some of this dynamic is a result of pent-up demand in the wake of widespread lockdowns, we're starting to see underlying recovery across most of our end markets that were impacted. Now if we take a closer look at these dynamics by geography, China appears to be the furthest along in terms of reopening, with activity levels largely back to normal. The US is not all the way back just yet, but is moving in the right direction. And an increase in vaccination rates across the country appear to be driving some of this progress. Europe is improving broadly. And while certain areas have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, we've not seen any material impact. In Life Sciences, activity in the broader biopharma market remains robust. There has not been any slowdown in the double-digit growth trend we've seen over the last several quarters across non-COVID-related biopharma activity. Within COVID-related biopharma activity, the significant ramp-up of vaccines and therapeutics is driving record bioprocessing demand. We're involved in the majority of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic projects underway around the world today, including all of those in the US that are currently on the market or in later-stage clinical trials. Our operating companies are playing a significant role in the development and production of new therapies and vaccines across the biopharma pipeline. And given the breadth of our offering and the production capacity we're adding in 2021, we're uniquely positioned to support our customers in their mission today and well into the future, which is to make more life-saving treatment available to more patients faster. In clinical diagnostics, we continue to see heightened demand for rapid point-of-care molecular testing. As we look across the COVID-19 testing landscape and consider the durability of the demand that we're seeing, we believe that Cepheid's positioning is the strongest amongst the various testing modalities and settings. Cepheid's leading presence at the point of care, combined with the speed, accuracy and workflow advantages of their molecular offering, uniquely positions the business to support customer\u2019s testing needs, not only for COVID-19, but beyond the pandemic as well. Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes are at or near pre-pandemic levels in most major geographies as elective procedures and hospital visits have rebounded from last year. Consumables growth is accelerating as a result, and we're encouraged by the momentum of instrument placement. Finally, in the applied market, consumables remain solid across essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food and medicine. And growth is picking up on the equipment side as customers get back to more normal operations and initiate capital investments. Now let's briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver second quarter core revenue growth in the mid-20s range. We anticipate low double-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a low double-digit core growth contribution from COVID-related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to have operating profit fall-through of approximately 40% in the second quarter and for the remainder of 2021. For the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver high teens core revenue growth. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will be a high single-digit to low double-digit contribution to the core revenue growth rate. This would include an estimated $2 billion of 2021 revenue at Cytiva and Pall Biotech associated with vaccines and therapeutics, which is higher than our previous expectation of $1.3 billion. And at Cepheid, we'll continue ramping capacity through the year and now expect to ship approximately 45 million tests in 2021 compared to our prior estimate of 36 million tests. And in our base business, we now expect that core revenue will be up high single digits for the full year. So to wrap up, we had a very strong start to the year and feel good about the momentum we're seeing across all of Danaher. Our first quarter results are a testament to the commitment and capability of our team and a durable, balanced positioning of our portfolio. We believe this combination differentiates Danaher and sets us up well to outperform in 2021 and beyond. In our pursuit of continuous improvement, we'll strive to keep building an even better, stronger company and to positively impact the world around us in meaningful ways for all of our stakeholders. We see tremendous opportunities ahead to do just that. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Lori, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, good morning. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : I'll start with bioprocess. Obviously, very strong numbers there. Did you give the Pall, Cytiva order number? I didn't hear that, if you did. And then as we kind of think about the durability of the trends there, I appreciate your kind of raising guidance here for both the vaccine and the testing tailwinds. But how do you think about kind of the durability? And then also, was there any stockpiling? We've heard from one of your peers about customers building inventory given supply chain concerns? Thanks. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Tycho. So as it relates to orders growth for our vaccines and therapeutics businesses we're talking primarily here, Cepheid and - I'm sorry, Cytiva and Pall Biotech, first quarter orders growth was over 60%, just to give you a sense of the strength of that. And as we look towards the rest of the year here, you heard us talk about the fact that we're confident now that our total business for the vaccine and therapeutics for 2021 will be $2 billion rather than the originally estimated $1.3 billion. So we continue to see that order build here, as noted here in the first quarter, and that's really continuing to drive strength here for the full year. Now as it relates to stockpiling, we occasionally hear about that on certain and limited products. But in general, and certainly, as we run our business, we're in constant communication, both with our customers and our suppliers to ensure that we don't have pockets of inventory, either a finished product or raw materials sitting idly by holding up any manufacturing of vaccine or therapeutics. Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on margins. Obviously, good upside here as well. In particular, on the Life Science side, you had 24% last quarter, now you're 33%. Can you maybe just talk to how you think about the durability of that margin improvement? Rainer Blair : Well, certainly, the volume ramp here has given us a great deal of volume leverage. And we also, of course, see through the increased consumption of our consumables, a skew in the mix towards the positive. So the margins are very strong. And as we look forward and the comps change and we continue to invest in our businesses, as well as we expect some costs to come back as we get to a more normalized travel situation, I would expect those margins to moderate a little bit. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then before I hop off, just one last one on capital deployment. You mentioned the bolt-ons for IDT and Cytiva. Obviously, we're seeing M&A pick up in the space more broadly. Just curious your thoughts on the landscape appetite for something more meaningful? Rainer Blair : We continue to be excited about our balance sheet and how quickly we've been able to rebuild that. Now having said that, it's just a year ago that we actually closed the Cytiva acquisition, and there's certainly plenty of work to do there. But having said that, our funnels are very active across all four of our platforms, and we think that we have plenty of opportunity ahead of us. Matt McGrew : Tycho, its Matt. I just want to get - kind of going back to your first question, just to give you some numbers around sort of the order growth. You had asked about sort of, I think, kind of the continuation of it. Maybe the way to think about it, at least how I think about it is in - for Pall and Cytiva in the vaccine and therapeutics, we did, call it, $500 million in Q1. I think that's going to be pretty consistent here, Q2, 3 and 4. So I think we'll probably do $2 billion for the full year in the vaccines and therapeutics, which will be, like I said, pretty consistent. And then I think when you think about maybe sort of the rest of it, the Cepheid part, that's going to ramp up as we go through the year, given the fact that we've talked about we're going to be doing a little bit more kind of volume here than we initially thought. So that's probably another $2 billion revenue. So total revenue, $4 billion for kind of that COVID tailwind. And one piece, the Cepheid piece will ramp up and the other piece, the vaccine and therapeutics, pretty steady through the year. Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's helpful. Should we assume some of that vaccine work also spills over into 2022? I know it's only the first quarter of '21, but that's the obvious question we're all going to get is what we set up for 2022 looks like? Rainer Blair : Yeah. So I think the way we're thinking about that is that we continue to build and ramp on orders growth here. And after the $2 billion, again, vaccine and therapeutics, we expect to have $1 billion of backlog vaccine and therapeutics going into 2022. And that's assuming, right now, with the approved vaccines that are in the various jurisdictions, which are eight currently. So that's the assumption there. And that's not assuming any booster shots or vaccinations of kids under 16. So we do expect to see further vaccine and therapeutic production well into 2022. Matt McGrew : Yes maybe, Tycho, a simple frame on the numbers of that, too, just to kind of give you a sense of it because I know Rainer mentioned it was $1 billion backlog. But the way that I think I'd frame it is, if you think about '20 and '21, we're probably going to see orders of, call it, 3.6, 3.7 billion cumulatively. I think we did $650 million in sales last year. We think we're going to do $2 billion in sales this year. So that $3.6 less, call it, $2.6 billion in sales is why we end up with a backlog at December of this year to take into '22. And like Rainer said, that really sort of doesn't kind of - that's just where we stand today with the assumption, as Rainer mentioned, that we are not really assuming kind of a fall booster/third shot. We're not assuming that vaccines are going to be out there for kids at this point either. So that's really just what's on the market now, the eight that are cleared and the ramp that we're seeing here in the developed markets largely. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll let others jump in. Rainer Blair : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Rainer Blair : Hi, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hi, Rainer. Congrats on a pretty solid print this morning. Just to follow up on that last question. I appreciate all the color. So you guys did $650 million of revenues, vaccine and therapeutics in 2020, cumulative of, call it, $2.6, $2.7 in 2020 and '21. And that does not include children or booster. Just assuming booster, I think most people are leaning towards a third shot. Given that we've recognized about $2.7, a booster third shot would imply another $1.3, like half of the $2.7 as potential incremental perhaps in 2022. Would that math make sense? I'm curious. Matt McGrew : Yeah. I mean Vijay, I think it's a little early to tell. I mean I think you're right in the assumption that most people, I think, are assuming there's a third shot or a booster. But again, I think it's - the timing and the amount and what it looks like is just a little early to tell. So that's why we sort of wanted to kind of give you what we're seeing now, the framework that doesn't really include it because that's still a bit of an unknown, but just so that you know sort of how we're thinking about where we stand here early - still pretty early in '21. But as that plays out maybe in the second half and in '22, kind of give you an update, but that is not inclusive of the numbers that I just laid out for you. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then I did have one follow-up on how to frame what the future could look like. And I'm not asking for guidance in fiscal '22. It's more perhaps broad strokes. And I think the debate has been for some of your peers with the exposure to COVID tailwinds. The debate has been whether companies can grow earnings in '22. I think you guys could end up being one of the few companies that can grow earnings off of fiscal '21 levels. I think Rainer, some of your comments on gaining share in biopharma. And you alluded to the fact, Cepheid, really strong demand. It looks like that increased installed base should flow through to other tests in post-pandemic. Am I right in thinking about some of those broad strokes about '22 earnings being above '21? Rainer Blair : So Vijay, let me lay out how we're thinking about '22 on the back of '21. And as Matt was just saying, it's a little early to get into specific specifics, as you can imagine. 2022 in this dynamic environment is a ways away. But having said that, we feel confident around the durability of our COVID revenues. So let me try and lay this out a little bit. As I mentioned, we think we entered 2022 with $1 billion in vaccine and therapeutic backlog. And the potential upside that we talked about based on the assumptions, not including boosters, not including kids being vaccinated, nor including at this point, other vaccine programs that might be earlier stage in the pipeline. If you think about that in our very, very broad portfolio, both in terms of upstream and downstream solutions, independent of the vaccine or therapeutic modality, we really see that we're very well positioned there. And that $1 billion backlog is sort of the beginning of that story. Now as we think about testing, so diagnostic testing for COVID, COVID is going to be or is already endemic, and we'll be testing at the point of care for a long time. And so while some folks are talking about 2021 being a peak year for testing for the market, we think Cepheid is uniquely positioned. You recall my example of the concentric circles with the highest durability tests being in the center, representing really Cepheid's point-of-care workflow. And as you think about Cepheid expanded installed base, the very strong menu that we have, we believe that we'll do roughly the same number of tests in 2022 as we are doing in 2021. And you'll recall, we just raised that from 36 million to 45 million tests. And then if you think about our base business, here, we really are and continue to be exposed to a number of attractive secular growth drivers. Biologics, more generally in life science research, along with molecular diagnostics and the decentralization of health care. And then, of course, environmental sustainability as you think about our water quality group and packaging needs continue to proliferate. So net-net, we feel we're uniquely positioned to outperform in 2021 and beyond. Vijay Kumar : Well, that is impressive. Thanks for the comments, guys. Congrats. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Rainer Blair : Hi, Doug. Doug Schenkel : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I just want to go back to guidance. And I think it's a math question. I'm just wondering if you could help us bridge essentially the delta between your prior core revenue growth guidance for low double digits and the updated range of high-teens growth? More specifically, I'm wondering where you're seeing the most improvement from a business perspective relative to where we were at your last update. And along those lines, what are you now assuming for the core operating environment, particularly as we look ahead to the second half of the year? Rainer Blair : Sure, Doug. So let's come back to the full year guide going from mid to high teens. And a simple frame if we start at the top there would be that we see the full year base business now at high single-digit core growth and full year COVID tailwinds to be in the high single, low double digits. Now if we start with the base business, we see that sustaining certainly at the current levels with customer activity around the world continuing to resume and approaching pre-pandemic levels. And then, of course, customers are adapting to this new work environment, and we see that in the form of strong sales funnels and our order book growth. Even service levels are at or near normal as we have much better site access than we have had for more normalized operation. And we're also seeing an uptick in instrument revenue as customers are starting to initiate new projects, upgrading and doing some capital investments. Now as I've mentioned here just a minute ago, from a COVID testing perspective, we still see the point-of-care testing at Cepheid easy workflow, the right answer being in short turnaround being the solution, the durable solution. And we see Cepheid actually accelerating here to 45 million tests versus the 36 million tests that we've spoken about. So we're seeing no falloff in demand for Cepheid tests. And the way to think about that is we did about 10 million here in Q1 and expect to increase by one million about each quarter. So 11 million in Q2, 12 million in Q3 and 13 million in Q4. And an important point to recognize here is our mix in Q1, COVID only versus foreign one was 50-50. Now as we go into the summer months here in the Northern Hemisphere, we see that mix going from 50-50 in Q1 to 80-20, 80 COVID, only 20 for 1 [ph] for Q2 and Q3. And then for Q4, we see that going back to - as we enter flu season and so forth, back to 50-50. So keep that in mind from a mix assumption perspective. Now if you look at this by segment, we see the Life Sciences growing over 20% here for the full year. Of course, bioprocessing that's non-COVID related, remains robust in the low double digits. As we've talked about, we're seeing our instruments improving. So if you think of like a microsystem, think about SCIEX, trends improved through 2021 as these projects are resuming as we speak and return to work. And then of course, the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics revenues we just talked about of about $2 billion. As you think about Diagnostics, here, we see ourselves in the high teens. Point of care, I talked about the expected 45 million tests at Cepheid as that capacity continues to build here through the year. And in our core and reference lab businesses, we see the volumes continuing to recover and the lockdown is really not having a material impact. So thinking about Beckman Diagnostics, Leica Biosystems in the low double digits here for the full year. And then from an EAS perspective, we see that in the mid single to high single digits as the consumables demand remains solid as it has been, but now we're starting to see equipment placements improving as well and in positive growth territories. And then lastly, if you build it out by geography, China, up over 20% for the year with a very strong recovery. North America, also in high teens, with Western Europe at low double digits. So that's how we're thinking about the frame here, by business as well as by geography, as well as base and COVID tailwind. Hopefully, that helps with that. Doug Schenkel : Yes. That is super helpful, and that's a lot of great detail. Maybe a very quick follow-up. And I think you sort of alluded to this or referred to this at the end, Rainer. But in terms of just high growth markets, growth was extremely strong in the first quarter. Some of that, I think, was just fundamental improvement. Some of that was favorable comps. But just kind of your last point, it does sound like you're expecting some sustained improvement in high growth market growth over the balance of the year, that kind of what we saw in Q1 is expected to be sustainable. Rainer Blair : We do. As you correctly point out, China, in particular, Q1 last year essentially was shut down. So the first quarter numbers we're very, very high. But having said that, not only in the market but also in our businesses, we see sustained, very strong growth in the high-growth markets, China being the best example of that with growth over 20% for the full year. Doug Schenkel : Great. okay. Thank you, again. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Rainer Blair : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : Good morning, Rainer and Matt. And Matt, good morning. Yes. Can you hear me, guys? Rainer Blair : Yes. Matt McGrew : Yes, we can hear you. You're good. Scott Davis : Okay. Okay. Good. I have a new headset, so I'm not sure if it works or not. So hopefully, it works. But anyways, Rainer, you talked a little bit about the capacity adds. Can you give us a little sense of the kind of the scope, how - I mean, you're talking about adding new lines in existing facilities? Are you talking about new facilities? And are you in process on this? Or is it done? Just a little bit of color around that would be helpful. Rainer Blair : So we are talking about all of that, Scott. We are opening up new facilities. For example, we're starting up a new plant in South Carolina. That will be targeted initially at single-use technologies, will be coming online, supporting both Pall Biotech as well as Cytiva. We've recently completed a small deal in China, buying out our joint venture partner and are expanding our single-use technology capacities on the ground in China as well. And then we have additional lines going in, in several facilities throughout the developed market. Once again, for single-use technologies, but also other biopharma-related portfolio increases. So all of the above and coming online here in the shorter term. Scott Davis : Now to the 40% incrementals that you're guiding to, which obviously seems conservative based on your history, is the new capacity - I mean, it probably comes in at a fairly low profit level at first. Does that play into this guidance at all? Or is it not really a big issue? Matt McGrew : No, Scott. It's not a huge issue for us in this year. I mean a lot of the stuff, too, when you think about what's coming online, think about capacity at Cepheid, that's pretty good margin for us. So if anything, it's probably on the margin, helpful, but it won't be a big drag. Scott Davis : Okay. All right. Good luck, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Matt McGrew : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks for the questions. And congrats on the quarter. Maybe a two parter on COVID. So it's interesting, the outlook for 2022 that Cepheid will remain consistent with '21. Can you just share some of your assumptions around that? Like what's kind of implied here are you thinking? And how are you thinking about the overall testing market that kind of gets you to that number? And then b, just on the vaccine therapeutics. I know kind of maybe dovetailing on kind of Scott's question in terms of capacity. Just what - can you share with us kind of where you are today from a total capacity in terms of being able to meet the demand that you see? How tight things are? And then as eventually COVID flows with the additional capacity building out, kind of how does that filter into the base bioproduction business? Rainer Blair : So let's start with COVID testing and the durability of that, Cepheid coming back really to what we're seeing today. We see no slowdown in the demand for Cepheid tests for COVID. So while the market, as I mentioned earlier, might peak this year in terms of testing, and we'll see if that's the case. But if we take that assumption, we continue to see that the value proposition that Cepheid offers at the point of care and as those tests wander from more distant testing setting back to the point of care that Cepheid's value proposition there in terms of workflow, speed and accuracy are really in the center of that concentric circle, and it's really - that's so important here to keep in mind. Also, we've increased the installed base of the gene experts now since the beginning of last year by over 40%. So a significant installed base increase. And that's actually the largest installed base of molecular diagnostics point-of-care test around the globe. At the same time, our broad menu, 30 tests approved outside the US, 20 inside of the US, is getting us into a care setting that we expect to provide strong durability here for the future. So that's what allows us here as we continue to increase capacity quarter-over-quarter to continue to increase our shipments. And as you think about 2022 going forward, first of all, the vaccines will take likely years to roll out to the entire world. Secondly, their effectiveness is on a continuum, some of them as high as 95%, others in the mid-60s. And so we're already seeing breakthrough infection. And there's also a number of people around the world who prefer not to get vaccinated. So testing will be continuing and very likely so at the point of care. And that just gives us the confidence based also on our conversations with our customers who are giving us outlook here for the next 18 to 24 months, that we're going to be able to maintain in 2022, the level of test shipment that we had here in 2021. So 45 million is what we're looking for, for 2021. Now as we think about - to your question on total capacity, is capacity tight? I think certainly, we are running very hard. But as I've mentioned in other settings, we have invested continuously here over the last 18 months in expanding our capacity. If we think about Cytiva in particular, even prior to the close with GE, we had an arrangement where we continued to increase capacity, and we've continued to invest very significantly in those capacity increases. So we're working together with our customers and our suppliers to make sure that we're able to supply the needs here in 2021 and going forward. Now to the other aspect of your question, once you have this capacity online, should vaccination and therapeutics peak, how do we think about that capacity going forward? And here, again, we're very bullish based on the development pipeline of biologic drugs, which continues to grow significantly. So even if you put COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics aside, the capacity requirements going forward continue to be significant. We're very confident that the capacity investments that we make today and tomorrow are very much needed here to supply the future needs of our customers. And they're certainly in dialogue with us specifically on that point. Dan Brennan : Sounds terrific, Rainer. Maybe just one quick follow-up. Just on Cepheid, I know it's been asked in the past, but we did, did a survey that showed there's likely to be a continued high usage level for a lot of these boxes that are placed. Just as we get beyond COVID, just any way to think about what Cepheid was like the growth rate you were thinking about before COVID and what that could be now given this dramatically larger installed base in the sense of how much of these boxes going to continue to get used beyond COVID? Thank you. Rainer Blair : Well, you've heard us speak about our frame of pre-pandemic and sort of post-herd immunity or post vaccination, where we saw Cepheid really growing in the low double digits pre-pandemic based on the menu at that time, which we've since expanded and will continue to expand going forward. And so the way we think about it is, at the very minimum, we should be able to drive continued low double-digit growth at Cepheid on the one hand. On the other hand, we do have now an endemic disease, COVID-19, and you really need to layer that type of testing on top of sort of this base testing rate that we have seen in the past. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that's what gives us confidence in the durability here, both in the near term and in the future. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you, Rainer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Rainer Blair : Hi, Dan. Dan Leonard : Hello. So a few questions. First off, on the guidance, I appreciate all the line item detail. But at a high level, how much conservatism do you think is still baked into that high single-digit view on the base business outlook given all of your commentary in the low single-digit comp? Rainer Blair : So as we look at our base business, we really see this as an appropriate view of what remains here of the year, and there's good reason for that. We continue to see labs opening up, patient volumes return. In the base business, we see in our Environmental & Applied Solutions business activity levels continue to pick up with our consumables running at a good strong rate and instrument continuing to be placed here as capital project go forward. And this is why we've increased that forecast on the base business from mid single to high single digits, and we think that's appropriate. As we look for the year, we still have a good part of the year ahead of us and think that's the appropriate way to think about it. Dan Leonard : Okay. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up. How are you thinking about prospects for inflation and your ability to offset inflationary pressures, maybe even from incremental efficiencies you've learned from operating during a lockdown? Rainer Blair : We've been in these kinds of environments before, and the Danaher Business System and the tool set that we apply every day really helps us to offset this. On the one hand, we're working closely with our suppliers and ensuring that we are working our price performance variations and the tool sets that we have there. Of course, we value engineer every day of the week. And then going forward, we also work on the pricing side to ensure that we're able to protect our margins and ensure that we capture the value of our differentiated and oftentimes IP-protected solutions going forward. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Rainer Blair : Hi, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Hey, how are you guys? Thanks. Rainer, you touched on it a little bit a couple of questions ago, but I wanted to drill in on the bioprocessing piece outside of the vaccine. Obviously, vaccine demand gets a lot on the headlines understandably. But can you just talk about what you're seeing in the market, kind of the underlying demand in the bioprocessing, bioproduction world? What do you think that market growth rate looks like over the next few years? And then to your point, how confident you are in that demand being enough to kind of fill the capacity that you're building out in the post-vaccine world, which, again, to your point, feels like it's multiple years away? But just wanted to talk about that market a little bit Rainer Blair : Sure, Patrick. There is a number of data points to consider here. Let me start with the fact that biologic drugs are highly efficacious and in very great demand, and that the penetration of these drugs throughout the world is still in the single-digit percentages, again, speaking now outside of COVID vaccine. So the penetration of these highly efficacious drug is still relatively low. On the other hand, when you look at the surge of capital investment that we see going into drug development, whether that be in traditional pharma or small biotech and throughout the world, we see that the drug pipeline and the associated number of drugs in the clinical - in clinical trials continues to ramp very significantly. And even if you apply sort of traditional success rates to the number of projects in those pipelines, you have to expect a very, very solid and continued growth here for the future, and we certainly do. And we expect that growth to be in the low double digits here on a sustained basis. And if you have any sort of additional leverage here as it relates to the transition from, for instance, stainless steel manufacturing solutions to single-use technologies for greater flexibility and ease of use and lower risk of cross-contamination, that provides additional impulses and catalysts to the growth rate, which will require the capacity that you see coming online. So we're very confident that the capacity that we're putting in place for our customers and to support their future growth is required here in the future. Patrick Donnelly : That's really helpful. I appreciate it. And then I just wanted to follow up on one of the cap deployment questions from earlier. We've seen some peers kind of step into other industries like the CRO world. I know you've talked a little bit about your interest or lack thereof in that type of space previously, but some thinking has evolved in other places. So I was wondering, is that a market that you'd be interested in getting into? And just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Rainer Blair : So we obviously don't want to comment on specific things happening here in the market. But what I can say is that we're really happy with the approach that we've taken with the acquisitions of Cytiva, Pall, IDT and Phenomenex. We're providing very specific practical and material solutions to our customer\u2019s pain points. These are all companies that are in the forefront of technologies with proprietary solutions, with high number of touch points and high customer intimacy and very importantly, recurring revenue, which is exactly the kind of businesses that we want to be in. And once again, coming back to the nature of this industry, in this industry, more often than not, scientists are making - or at the very minimum, heavily influencing the purchasing decision as opposed to economic bundles really being a point of leverage. And why is that? Because the value in getting a, for instance, biologic drug to market faster by just one week, if it's a $1 billion drug a year, is $20 million. The value of increasing your yield by 2% to 5% is several tens of millions of dollars. So that's how we think about the fact that our strategy and the way we're focused is, is the way to be. Patrick Donnelly : Very helpful. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. I will now return the call to Matt Gugino for any closing comments. Matt Gugino : Thanks, Lori, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We're around all day for questions. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Danaher Corporation's first quarter 2021 earnings results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Crystaal and I'll be your conference operator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Crystaal. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until August 5, 2021. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance.  Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the second quarter of 2021, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices, which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile, we're presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. References to core revenue growth includes Cytiva sales in the calculation of period-to-period sales growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well, thanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We're very pleased with our strong start to the year with another terrific results in the second quarter. We saw broad-based strength across the portfolio, which helped us deliver over 30% core revenue growth, more than 70% adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding free cash flow generation. This well rounded performance is a testament to the positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team who are committed to leading and executing with the Danaher Business Systems every day.  During the second quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through significant high impact organic growth investments and enhanced our portfolio with strategic growth accelerating acquisitions.  We prioritized innovation across Danaher and increased our production capabilities, all of which we believe contributed to the market share gains in several of our businesses.  We also announced our pending acquisition about Aldevron, which will expand our presence into the fast growing and important frontier of genomic medicine. Putting it all together, we believe the combination of our leading portfolio and DBS driven execution differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable long-term outperformance.  So, with that, let's turn to our second quarter results. Our sales were $7.2 billion and we delivered core revenue growth of 31.5%, with strong contributions from all three of our reporting segments.  Geographically, high growth markets grew nearly 35% and developed markets were up more than 25%. Revenue in each of our three largest markets, North America, Western Europe, and China, was up 30% or more in the quarter. Our gross profit margin increased by 710 basis points to 60.9%, primarily due to higher sales volumes, the favorable impact of higher margin product mix and the impact of prior-year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021. Our operating profit margin increased to 27.8%, including 775 basis points of core operating margin expansion, primarily as a result of higher gross margin and continued lower operating expense as travel and other related costs remained below pre-pandemic levels.  Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.46 were up to 71% compared to 2020. We generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up over 40% year-over-year.  In June, we announced our intention to acquire Aldevron, a producer of high quality plasmid DNA, mRNA and protein, serving academic, biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers. The addition of Aldevron will expand our capabilities into the important field of genomic medicine, where we're seeing the accelerated adoption of gene and cell therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines and gene editing technology.  We anticipate Aldevron will be accretive to Danaher on multiple levels as we expect the business to generate $500 million of revenue in 2022, with more than 20% annual revenue growth and a strong margin profile. We look forward to welcoming this incredibly talented and innovative team to Danaher once the transaction closes.  In addition to announcing Aldevron acquisition, we also accelerated several organic growth investments across the portfolio. One of our core values at Danaher is innovation defines our future. And we have made a significant commitment toward our research and development efforts, increasing our research and development spend by more than 30% year-over-year to bring more impactful solutions to our customers.  At SCIEX, we launched the ZenoTOF 7600, a high resolution accurate mass spectrometry system that enables scientists to identify, characterize and quantify molecules at previously undetectable level, helping to advance the development of new biotherapeutics and precision diagnostics.  At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, we recently introduced the DxA 5000 Fit, a compact automation solution designed for small and mid-sized laboratories that reduces up to 80% of the manual steps typically required for sample preparation.  These are just a few great examples of how we're continuing to invest for growth across Danaher to support our customers and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation.  Additionally, we're making substantial investments to expand capacity across our bioprocessing businesses and Cepheid. Near term, these investments are supporting existing customer demand, driven by both the market and meaningful share gains. But they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses where we see tremendous runway ahead, given the underlying structural growth drivers in the market they serve.  We expect our total capital expenditures across Danaher to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021 as we continue to invest in support of our customers' needs today and well into the future. We believe the strategic combination of these organic and inorganic investments across our portfolio will reinforce our competitive advantage and accelerate our growth trajectory going forward.  Now, let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segments. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 41.5%, with core revenue up 35%. This growth was broad based, with most of our major businesses in the platform delivering 30% or better core growth. We continue to see strong demand for our bioprocessing solutions with combined core revenue growth of more than 40% with Cytiva and Pall Biotech.  Our non-COVID related bioprocessing business was up low double digit, where we saw robust customer activity and order rates. COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenues were consistent with the first quarter and exceeded $1 billion over the first six months of the year. So, I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to reflect on Cytiva's fantastic first year as part of Danaher. We've established a new company with a new brand name, added more than 1,500 associates and made substantial progress in the transition to Danaher, all while maintaining world class support of our customers, significantly ramping production capacity and growing revenue by more than 50%.  When we announced the acquisition, we talked about the strategic and value creation opportunities we saw, and we're excited to welcome such a talented and engaged team to Danaher. I think it's fair to say they've exceeded our expectations in every way. And that's really a testament to the Cytiva team who've embraced Danaher and the Danaher Business System and continued to execute exceptionally in support of our customers. Moving to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 40.5% and core revenue grew 37%, led by more than 50% core growth at Cepheid. Beckman Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems each grew more than 30% as patient volume and clinical diagnostic activity approached pre-pandemic levels around the world.  At Cepheid, growth outside of respiratory testing was led by our sexual health and hospital acquired infection assays, particularly among newly acquired Cepheid customers. In respiratory testing, we believe we continued to gain market share as expanded manufacturing capacity enabled the team to produce and ship approximately 14 million cartridges in the quarter.  As expected, COVID-only tests accounted for approximately 80% of these shipments, while our four-in-one combination test for COVID-19 Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 20%. This broad-based performance across Cepheid was driven by the team's thoughtful installed base expansion over the last 15 months and is evidence of the significant value Cepheid provides to clinicians with unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results, and the best-in-class, easy-to-use workflow at the point of care.  Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 15.5% and core revenue was up 13%. Revenue growth accelerated across both platforms with water quality up high single-digit and product identification up approximately 20% in the quarter.  In our water quality businesses, demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by improving activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end markets. Equipment order rates accelerated as customers got back up and running and began to invest in larger projects. In product identification, Videojet was up mid-teens and our packaging and color management businesses were up more than 25% in the quarter. This acceleration reflected a broad-based recovery with growth across most major geographies and end markets.  So, with that as a backdrop for what we saw this quarter, let's spend some time going through trends geographically and across our end markets. Looking at conditions around the world, most major regions and countries have broadly returned to or are approaching normal operations. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen across the US, Europe and China. That said, we're mindful of the emerging COVID-19 variants driving further outbreaks, and have taken action to help minimize the potential impact on our respective businesses. And at this point, we've seen no material impact from recent variants or selective lockdowns. We saw positive momentum across our businesses with order growth trending above revenue growth. Most of our end markets have largely recovered, with growth rates at or above pre-pandemic levels as customers have adapted to the new environment.  In-person commercial activity continues to rebound, and we're seeing our teams spend more time on site with their customers, a trend we expect to continue as we move through the year. Across Life Sciences, we're seeing healthy demand in most of our end markets, led by biopharma where the pace of customer activity remains elevated. Biotech funding levels are robust and the number of lifesaving biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise, and it's further augmented by the work around COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.  Today, there are over 1,500 monoclonal antibody-based therapies in development globally, which is more than 50% increase from just five years ago. We also see over 1,000 gene therapy candidates in development today, a tenfold increase over the last several years as these technologies mature and therapies gain regulatory approval. Given that many of these candidates are still in early stage research, we expect the growth rate of this market to remain strong for many years to come. In addition to the growth in biologics and genomic-based medicines, there is significant demand related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, both on the market and in development today. Given the interest we're seeing from customers looking to address emerging variants and increased global supply, as well as evolving vaccination guidelines globally, we expect to see durable growth in this segment of the biopharma market for the foreseeable future.  At the current pace of vaccination, it's clear that vaccine demand will continue well into next year. We expect to recognize $2 billion in COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue in 2021 and anticipate entering 2022 with approximately $1.5 billion in COVID-related backlog. These assumptions do not include the potential contribution from booster shots or an expansion of availability to populations under 12 year old due to the level of uncertainty around each of these scenarios. Given the growing numbers of drugs being developed and the increasing scientific sophistication required to discover and manufacture these complex therapies, customers are looking to partner with vendors who can reliably supply them with solutions for their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale.  Our comprehensive bioprocessing portfolio and scientific expertise positions us well to do just that. And we're confident our proactive investments in innovation and capacity will help us meet this growing customer demand now and far into the future.  In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes are at or near pre-pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness check, routine screening and other elective procedures.  In molecular diagnostics, while PCR respiratory testing volumes in the US have declined, we're seeing persistent demand for Cepheid testing at the point of care. Outside of the US, which makes up approximately half of Cepheid's revenue, we continue to see strong demand for our testing as vaccination rates lag and emerging variants drive outbreaks.  Now, as I mentioned earlier, we shipped approximately 14 million respiratory tests during the second quarter, up from 10 million shipped in the first quarter, and we now expect to ship approximately 50 million tests in 2021.  Looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be an endemic disease, we believe that the point of care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. And given Cepheid's leading positioning around speed, accuracy, and the ease of use workflow advantages, we believe we'll continue to gain market share.  The combination of these market share gains, the expansion of Cepheid's leading global installed base and the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market creates significant opportunities ahead for broader utilization and demand for Cepheid point-of-care molecular testing solution. Moving to the applied markets, we're seeing a continuation of the steady improvement over the first half of the year. Customer activity is accelerating in line with broader economic activity, which we see in healthy order rates for consumables and increasing investment in equipment.  Across municipal markets globally, consumable demand remains solid as customers continue to test and treat water and instrument-oriented project activity is accelerating with the improving funding environment.  Now, let's look ahead to our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver third quarter core revenue growth in the mid to high-teens range. We anticipate high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of approximately 40% in the third quarter and for the remainder of 2021.  For the full-year 2021, we now expect to deliver approximately 20% core revenue growth. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwind will be an approximately 10% contribution to the core revenue growth rate. And in our base business, we now expect that core revenue will be up 10% for the full year, an increase from our prior expectation of high single-digits. So, to wrap up, we've had a great start to the year and we've seen meaningful opportunities across Danaher to build upon this outstanding performance. Our second quarter results reiterate the power of our portfolio and our exceptional team, a unique combination that differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable long-term outperformance. With that, back to you, Matt. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Crystaal, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Congrats on the quarter. Rainer, I think one of the debates around the stock is still around the testing outlook, in particular around 2022 for Cepheid. I know you came out in the first quarter and talked about the fact you thought trends would be sustainable heading into next year. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the field, how you're thinking about variants in the near term and what gives you confidence in the outlook for 2022? Obviously, you're more hospital with PCR, not antigen. So, we get all those dynamics. But I think there's still some debate as to whether testing could drop off more significantly next year. Rainer Blair : As we think about the remainder of 2021 and how that sets us up for 2022, just a couple of things to sort of set the baseline here. First of all, we now expect to ship 15 million tests in 2021 for COVID, either COVID only or four-in-one. And we've taken that up from the 45 million test guide before. And the confidence that we gain here is really through what we've seen. As we've ramped up our capacity here and shipped 14 million cartridges in Q2, you'll recall we originally expected to ship 11 million in Q2. 50% of that outside of the US, 50% of that inside the US. That really has given us the confidence that there's still plenty of demand for our solution at the point of care.  And here's why? We're really not perceiving a slowdown currently in our testing demand, and we're shipping everything that we're producing. So, while it's true that we see core lab tests trending downwards, we continue to see strength in the demand for our testing solution.  The other thing that we are considering here is we're a bit concerned about some of the RSV breakouts that we're seeing in the US, but also elsewhere in the world, which makes us think that we'll start seeing testing skew more towards the four-in-one solution which, of course, tests for RSV in addition of Flu A, B And COVID-19. So, as we think about where we sit today, we feel comfortable that we'll see 50 million tests this year, and we don't have anything that would indicate that our previous guide for 45 million tests in 2022 would be materially different. We continue to see plenty of opportunity. Keep in mind, we've increased our installed base by 40% since the beginning of the pandemic, and of course, have the largest testing menu with 30 plus tests outside the US and 20 plus tests in the US. So, we feel we feel strongly that that demand should be available to us once again because of that unique value proposition at the point of care. Tycho Peterson : A follow-up on Aldevron. I think you mentioned when we spoke on the deal that you've been looking at this asset for about five years. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about synergies? I know there's capacity expansion that's coming online next year. So, if you could talk to that. And then, I think to get to half a point of growth, the implied growth rate is closer to 35%. Definitely greater than 20%. But I'm just curious how you're thinking about growth outlook and synergies with Pall and Cytiva, in particular. Rainer Blair : As we look at Aldevron, we really see it as our entry into the genomic medicine market, and are seeing it really as a standalone in that regard, specifically with plasmid DNA, protein and mRNA, and are really not looking initially here at synergies related to Cytiva or Pall. There's plenty of opportunity inside that scope to invest, expand capacity in the existing product lineup, as well as to globalize that. The great majority of Aldevron's revenues are actually in the US. So, we see great opportunities to globalize that. And from a growth perspective, like we said, this is in 2022 going to be $0.5 billion business growing at 20%, adding about 50 basis points to Danaher's overall growth profile, as well as adding $0.20 of EPS in year one and $0.30 EPS in year two. Matt McGrew : Tycho, they have a little bit better growth historically than kind of that 20%. But I think, again, just sort of from our perspective, to be prudent from a planning perspective, that's sort of what we've laid out. I think we've had a lot of success with that type of setting up, if you will, for acquisitions in the past. That's sort of why we've kind of come to there versus where they have been a little bit more historically higher. Tycho Peterson : Matt, can you just comment on the bioprocessing order book? I think you said bioprocessing up 40%. I assume that was revenues. What was the order book up? Matt McGrew : It was north of 60%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Hey, this is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. A couple quick ones. Just to clarify, on the COVID contribution for the fiscal year, it sounds like you're saying 10%, which is roughly unchanged from prior, but you're seeing a lot more cartridges coming out. The four-in-one solution should have some better pricing if you're going with that versus the COVID-only. And the COVID vax is doing better and the order book is strong. So, are there some other moving pieces there? Or is this just some uncertainty back half of the year? Just want to reconcile that. Matt McGrew : I think the way to think about the COVID tailwind is we sort of took up the number for the full year, Mike. And I think what I would kind of think about that is that most of that is the $200 million better cartridge performance that we saw here in Q2 sort of rolling through for the full year. So, if you think about the COVID contributions, I think we're up $200 million versus where we thought we would be. All of that is just going to be sort of rolling that Q2 beat through to the full year for the COVID. side. As far as the four-in-one goes, as we think about the contribution kind of going forward, we still think Q3 is probably going to be pretty close to what we saw here in Q2, which was \u2013 80% of that was COVID only, 20% was the four-in-one.  Given what Rainer said and what we saw last year as well, but what Rainer said around the RSV sort of outbreak here that we're seeing in the south, we think we might have a little bit of a different or more of a respiratory season than we did last year. So, sort of as we move forward, we're sort of thinking, Q4, that split moves more to kind of a 50/50, 60/40. We'll see where it comes out, but something more like that in the fourth quarter. Michael Ryskin : Could you comment a little bit on instrument trends in some of the analytical markets? I didn't get a clean SCIEX number. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in LCMS markets as far as base business recovery? Rainer Blair : If we start with the topic of customer activity in these analytical markets, they're really at or very near pre-pandemic levels with the underlying recovery well underway. And we're seeing the customers adapting readily to new work environments that we're in there where it's still necessary or are fully back to normal where the infection rates are really low. So, that manifests itself in better order rates, our funnels are stronger, we see higher instrument and service sales. Keep in mind, SCIEX over 30% core growth here in Q2, just as a marker. But really, all of our major life science operating companies were at or over 30% core growth for the quarter. So, we're seeing some very nice momentum there.  And if you look at the two-year growth stack there, we're really at or very near to pre-pandemic growth rate. While this is driven by more customer activity, but we also have to say, in our instrument areas is a place where we have been accelerating R&D investment and we've seen great traction for some of our new product introductions. I mentioned the SCIEX ZenoTOF, but we've also introduced the 7500. And at Beckman Life Sciences, we introduced the CytoFLEX cell sorter. So, those are all things that contribute to what we think is outperformance here in the instrumentation market. Matt McGrew : Mike, just to give you a sense, outside of life sciences, just overall, equipment was up north of 20% and consumables were north of 30%. So, just to give you a sense of \u2013 that's not all that different from what we saw elsewhere as well. Michael Ryskin : One last quick one if I can squeeze it in. I think you called out CapEx of $1.5 billion for the year. That's a pretty nice step up even with Cytiva in the numbers. Just wondering how much of that is specific to more cartridges for Cepheid, for COVID or more on the bioprocessing side? And is this a fair jumping off point for 2022 and beyond? Rainer Blair : I think, Mike, normally even inclusive of Cepheid or Cytiva, we'd probably be more like $850 million in CapEx. So, I think you can kind of size the delta on that $1.5 billion with that. I would say that the preponderance of the increase that you're seeing there is going to be at Cepheid and Cytiva as at Pall on the bioprocessing side. So, those would be the three big ones that will be sort of driving that increase. I suspect \u2013 you'll see that, obviously, this year. I suspect we might be at something in between those two numbers. Maybe we're at the higher end of that number, the $850 million and the $1.5 billion as we head into next year. But I think, over time, that probably does start to come down a touch. As we've talked about, we've been pulling forward a lot of the capacity increases that we were already planning for all of those businesses, just given the demand now, plus the longer-term secular growth drivers. This is sort of more of a pull forward is the way I think about it, and I think you'll have a little bit of a bolus [ph] here for a couple years and then probably come back down to a lower landing level. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congratulations on a solid print this morning. Maybe one on vaccines and bioprocessing, Rainer. The commentary around backlog, exit backlogs stepping up for the year in light of 2Q, it feels like maybe the order conversion, maybe that's stepping down in back half. And is that the right way? This is just more of a timing thing that we're thinking about on the vaccine side when you think about the revenue cadence? And then, ex vaccines, when you think about pace, bioprocessing, we just had a major Alzheimer's drug approval. I'm curious what it does to either industry growth or perhaps at your business. Rainer Blair : Let's start with bioprocess and how to think about that. So, just to level-set, we expect to do for vaccines and therapeutics this year $2 billion in revenue, and that second half is going to be consistent with what you saw in the first half. And so, the activity level remains elevated. And any decel that you're thinking about is purely related to comps. And now more broadly speaking, speaking really for total Danaher, the Q2, Q3 prior year step up is over 1,000 basis points. Right? So, if you keep that in mind, I think that characterizes the activity level appropriately. We continue to see strength in vaccine and therapeutic. Orders, Matt has talked about it with Tycho, 40% plus on the revenue side in Q2, 60% plus on the order side. So, the activity level remains very high. And we expect that this will continue, which is why we're confident in talking about $1.5 billion of backlog for 2022, which sitting here on July 20 looking forward is a good place for us to be. And it gives us, as you think about 2022, a number of quarters to continue to strengthen that. So, there's a great deal going on in the vaccine and therapeutic space. Keep in mind, the rollout that we've seen has been primarily a developed market story. We're starting now to see some of the emerging market vaccine manufacturers kicking in and ramping up. There's three in China to say an example. Another one in Russia, of course, and several more. And they're just starting to kick in. So, we expect that all to provide really some sustained strength for some period of time. Matt McGrew : Vijay, maybe just a 100,000 foot view, just to kind of think about \u2013 in each of the last five quarters in biotech, the bookings have been higher than revenue. And that was also true in Q2, just to kind of \u2013 there's all kinds of numbers and comps and everything else, just take a step back and just kind of keep that in mind as we head into the second half here. Rainer Blair : Now coming back to your Alzheimer drug question with Aduhelm, first of all, we can't comment specifically on any particular drug. But we're absolutely delighted to see that science and the pharmaceutical industry is making progress on this disease. Alzheimer's, as you know, afflicts so many around the world and there's a real need for a solution. At this point, it's early days. As you know, there's quite a bit of discussion around the efficacy of the drug, the size of the target population, reimbursement, and a number of other questions.  But I might say that this is one drug. There are several others that are in late stage qualification and approval processes. And so, we do see here this indication of Alzheimer's disease becoming more and more relevant for monoclonal antibodies. Awfully early to say what impact it has, but we can say that with the breadth of our portfolio, the capability of our team and the penetration that we have in the market, it's fair to say that we're represented on all of those projects and are confident that we can supply those, should there be an elevated need. Vijay Kumar : Matt, one quick one for you. Appreciate you're trying to simplify the numbers. A lot of numbers flying around. With orders above revenue for five quarters, I think that's straightforward. Assuming mix is \u2013 ignoring the mix impact for 2022, any comments on margins or incremental margin for fiscal 2022 as expenses come back? Matt McGrew : Vijay, I'd love to have the crystal ball for 2022 for you, but I'm just still hoping to get some insight into the second half, frankly. Like you said, besides the mix, we are starting to \u2013 as we got into the quarter and we had pretty good fall through here in the quarter again, but we are starting to see activity resume a little bit, especially late in the quarter. A little bit more travel activity, a little bit more kind of people doing in-person things. And so, I think, in my mind, there's two things. It's when do the costs come back because I do believe we will have some costs come back, and how fast that happens. So, it's just really kind of balancing those two. And I think there's still enough uncertainty out there that it's difficult to pin that down. I'm hoping that as we get into the fall here that we get a bit more color on that, and hopefully be able to provide a little bit more when we talk about 2022 later in the year. But unfortunately, I think it's a little early for us to think about it. But that's where we are today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : I was really surprised. I thought you might mention labor and logistics costs and some challenges there, particularly in E&AS. Is there a meaningful impact on margins, more broad based in E&AS, if so? I'd just leave it there. Matt McGrew : It's a fair point. We have definitely seen it. I think, again, similar to the travel sort of as we've moved through the quarter, I think we are definitely seeing inflationary pressures here and supply chain pressures. I would say that, right now, for us, it is modest. And we're able to manage through it, some of that with better price on our side and some of it just being able to on the daily work, if you will, from a DBS perspective, but we are definitely seeing that. We are seeing it in resins, in plastics, in metals. Again, not a huge part for us, but we do see it where that happens. I think the two biggest pieces for us, Scott, our freight is definitely an issue. Fewer cargo flights obviously means it's a little bit more expensive to move things by air. And then, I think as everybody has read and saw, electronics, particularly the supply chain around the chips globally, has been a challenge for us as well.  So, again, haven't seen material impact. I do believe that as we move forward into the second half that that probably does not abate, if anything might step up a little bit and clearly a challenge here for us. But so far, we've been able to work through it with some hard work and a little bit of price and some PPV. Scott Davis : Just to follow-up on that, Matt. Does times like this really make looking at things like on-time delivery kind of wonky and hard to even think? Can you still use that metric with any real sense of confidence since orders are so high? Rainer Blair : We don't compromise on that. The core value, customers talk, we listen. And our focus on quality, delivery, and cost remains our Northstar. And we drive our processes. And with that, anybody who's associated with that, starting with what we can control internally, but also our supply partners who have been stepping up to the plate supporting us here and making the necessary investments. But we're not going to compromise on on-time delivery and meeting or exceeding our customer's expectation. Scott Davis : Well, congrats, guys. And congrats on a great start, Rainer, in your CEO tenure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel : I want to go back and try to kind of take a different angle on some of the questions regarding durability of growth when it comes to all things post-COVID. So, on Cepheid, there was an earlier question on the outlook for testing volume in 2022. You've noted before, your GeneXpert install base increased by about 40% since the beginning of the pandemic. You've also previously talked about your efforts to be as smart as you can about where you place boxes. Essentially, the goal has been to as much as possible pull forward placements, especially in areas of the world where you may have been under indexed in an effort to make sure that these instruments are used durably over the long term. I was wondering if you could share some specific data on how you're having success with newer accounts driving utilization of these boxes for non-COVID-19 purposes? And additionally, is it possible that there are some new assays coming over the coming quarters that might move you into additional testing categories that also boost your confidence in the outlook for durability? I ask because right before the pandemic got going, we had picked up on some signs that there were some notable advancements being made on assay development initiatives, including some of those talked about in the past by old Cepheid management, which would greatly increase the TAM for the company. I think a lot of lingering concerns about this category would be further assuaged by combining what we saw in Q2, which was really strong with the outlook for assay menu expansion and some positive signs in terms of what's going on with newer accounts. Rainer Blair : I think you're on to a strong point here, which is \u2013 and we saw this in Q2, but just to level-set for everybody here on the phone. Once again, we've increased our installed base here since the beginning of the pandemic by 40% plus, and that's with thousands of instruments in places where they haven't been before. And we've tried to do that very strategically, always, of course, wanting to help with the COVID pandemic and the near-term requirements and needs, but also looking beyond that to see whether those care settings would be able to use the menu that we have available today and the one that, of course, we develop every day in order to launch new assays. And we have seen that starting to play out in places where perhaps the COVID need is not as strong and particularly at new customers. And that's manifested, for instance, in our sexual health or hospital acquired infections assays, which are up 30% plus, here in the second quarter, and provide us with an additional pillar of strength. And so, we're very pleased with that. And we expect that to continue here as we not only made progress in the US, but in the rest of the world. So, very important point. The menu is gaining traction, and we're starting to see that play out here in the second quarter and expect that to continue to be the case going forward.  Now, as it relates to new assays, please know that we are working on new assays every day. And you can expect that, over time, to continue to broaden that lead in menu breadth, as well as depth over time. So, that's absolutely a part of our daily activity here. Doug Schenkel : Hopping over to really the Pall and the Cytiva side of the equation, as we've talked about it a few times, the expected backlog heading into 2022 is $1.5 billion. The potential for upside, I think, seems pretty clear specific to COVID. That said, there is still some investor uncertainty with regards to what happens if demand were to slow in this category. A basic but important question is if demand were to slow for COVID related products and services in this category, is it fair to say that you're comfortable that there was enough demand more broadly across biopharma to essentially compensate for that? Our thinking has been, this has been an area where there just hasn't been enough good supply of products and services, and that's presented you with a fantastic opportunity to basically solve that problem. Even if the COVID demand were to slow, presumably, you're still going to be able to essentially reallocate these products and services for other purposes. Is that a fair way of thinking about things? Rainer Blair : I think so. And before we move on to the non-COVID strength out there, let's reiterate in relation to that backlog number that we talked about what assumptions are in that and which assumptions are not in that number. So, in that $1.5 billion backlog, that's in addition to the $2 billion that we're shipping this year, that includes all the approved vaccines, whether those are approved in the US and Europe or elsewhere, as well as those in late stage trials, which you can imagine we're very close to. So, that's absolutely a part of how we're thinking about that. And it includes these emerging market vaccines that I was talking about. But what it doesn't include is the booster shot. And we know from Israel, we know from the UK, we know from China that those countries are now moving to booster shots, but we have not assumed that to be a part of our numbers here, nor have we included the younger kids, 12 and under, in a vaccination schedule, which you can imagine on a worldwide basis is a pretty big number. So, we've kept that out. And we think that that's an appropriate assumption. Now as we look to the non-COVID demand, which has consistently been in the low double digits here, with one or the other quarter perhaps even above, we feel very confident that the number of projects in the pipeline, we talked about it, over 1,500 monoclonal antibodies in the development pipeline, over 50% more than just five years ago. And then you add, related to that, the gene and cell therapies and genomic medicines where you have over 1,000 projects in the pipeline, which is an order of magnitude more than just five years ago, we feel quite strongly that the capacity utilization will remain very robust here for the mid and long term. Operator : And your last question will come from the line of Daniel Leonard with Wells Fargo. Daniel Leonard : Two, if I may. The first one on bioprocessing. We're still hearing about supply shortages in the market for filters and such. When do you think we're going to see more of an equilibrium, when supply catches up with demand? Is there any change in your thinking on customer inventory dynamics around stocking and such? Rainer Blair : Let me start with this. I think that, in general, there is a strong supply of filters, as you mentioned, perhaps single use products and such in the market and that there might be pockets where there's some shortages, but I think I would prescribe those to individual type product shortages as opposed to a broad-based shortage as the industry and, particularly, Danaher has continued to ramp capacities with some of the investments that we made. So, I think that what the industry has been able to do is accompany the growth here and continue to support that.  Now, as it relates to your inventory question, here we have been very, very rigorous in our interactions with our customers who we've asked and encouraged to give us their orders as early as possible to give us the visibility that we need to ensure that they get what they need. And as such, we don't believe that there's pockets of inventory that are sitting here in the industry. You can never ignore that there might be one or two places that perhaps that might be the case, but it's really not material in the overall size of the industry. So, we think that the industry is tight on supply. Everybody is working through it with each other, we with our customers with a great deal of visibility, but of course also with our suppliers who we mentioned earlier, who have also had to ramp up to support us and the value chain. Daniel Leonard : My follow-up question is similar to Vijay's earlier on the margin side. Could you perhaps maybe bridge the expense base today when you have these COVID sales tailwinds to a world where those tailwinds might abate? Are there any expenses that that go away? Or just maybe the rate of expense increase starts to moderate? Matt McGrew : I think maybe the way to answer that is, today, we've been sort of seeing in the last, I guess, five quarters, our VCM has been kind of 50%. And as I look forward and think about the expenses coming back, and it's not just COVID, I would say it's kind of broadly speaking across the business, we think it's going to start to ramp here in the second half and be in the sort of 40% fall through. Dan, if you think about where we've been more historically, it's probably been more like 35%. And so, I think what we'll see is that the expenses \u2013 and here again, the uncertainty in the timing is what I'm still not sure on, but I think what we'll see is that that expense base will come back a little bit more closer to that normal, longer-term 35%. And part of that is not only are we \u2013 we're sort of seeing the benefits, I think, of the investments that we continue to make and we have been making in innovation and kind of go-to-market. And I think with that, if you think about today, our base business on a two-year stack for this year is going to be 6% to 7% core growth, which is 100 basis points plus where we were in 2019. And so, I think the investments that we're making are paying off on the growth side. And I think both Rainer and myself are inclined to want to kind of keep making those investments, while recognizing that we're going to have some costs that come back as we get back to the office and we start to travel again.  So, maybe, Dan, the way to bridge it would be 50% today, I think, probably is a little bit more like 40% in the second half, and over time, I think it probably is something more like 35% if I had to guess. Operator : We have reached the allotted time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Gugino for closing remarks. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Crystaal. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. And we're around all day for questions. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Matt, thank you and good morning everyone. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our team delivered another outstanding result in our third quarter with over 20% core revenue growth, nearly 40% adjusted earnings per share growth, and strong free cash flow generation. This well-rounded performance is a testament to the unique positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team who are committed to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System every day. I'd like to thank all of you who joined us last month for our Virtual Investor Day, where we had the opportunity to showcase the strong foundation we\u2019ve built for generating sustainable, long-term outperformance. We highlighted our fantastic portfolio of market-leading franchises in highly attractive end markets, the exceptional team we have out on the field every day, and how we differentiate with the Danaher Business System. And we certainly saw this powerful combination in action during the third quarter as our results attest. Now we also talked about our sustainability efforts. And just last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report. This year's report reflects the measurable progress we've made across the three pillars of our sustainability program, which are innovation, people, and the environment, and how we use the Danaher Business System to execute on this increasingly important strategic priority. Now, I hope you all get a chance to read through the report and learn more about the important work that we're doing across Danaher, to positively impact the world around us for generations to come. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. Our sales were $7.2 billion and we delivered 20.5% core revenue growth with portfolio-wide strength led by Diagnostics and Life Sciences. Geographically, high-growth markets grew approximately 25% and developed markets were up nearly 20%. In fact, revenue in each of our three largest markets; North America, Western Europe, and China, was up approximately 20% or more in the quarter. Our gross profit margin increased by 550 basis points to 60.3% primarily due to higher sales volumes, the favorable impact of higher margin product mix, and the impact of prior-year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021. Now, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.39 and were up 39% compared to 2020, and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 5.2 billion, which is up 46.5% year-over-year. We continue to accelerate organic growth investments across the entire portfolio, and increased our research and development spend by approximately 30% year-over-year. At our Investor Day recently, we highlighted how we use DBS growth tools and processes to accelerate innovation and bring more impactful solutions to our customers faster. In fact, recently launched products like the SCIEX, ZenoTOF 7600, and the Triple Quad 7500 and Beckman Life Sciences, CytoFLEX SRT Benchtop Cell Sorter are just a few great examples of how we're driving market share gains through proprietary innovation and enhancing our growth trajectory going forward. We're also making substantial investments to expand production capacity across our bio-processing businesses and at Cepheid. Near-term these investments are supporting existing customer demand and driving meaningful share gains. But they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses where we see significant runway ahead given the underlying structural growth drivers in the sectors they serve. And we expect our total capital expenditures across Danaher to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021 as we continue to invest in support of our customers' need today and well into the future. So, now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segments. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 24.5% with core revenue up 20%. This growth was broad based across the segment with most major operating companies achieving high teens or better core growth. Now these strong results were led by continued demand for our bioprocessing solutions as in Cytiva bioprocessing and Pall Biotech, both grew more than 30% in the quarter, including low double-digit, non-COVID related core growth. COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue continued to be strong and now exceeds $1.5 billion year-to-date. At Cytiva, we passed an important milestone last month when we exited the last of our transition services agreement with GE. We successfully completed this process ahead of schedule, which is a testament to the entire Cytiva and integration team and their collective commitment to the Danaher Business System. Cytiva also added more than 1,500 new associates to the global team since joining Danaher to help ensure that we are supporting our customers today and continue meeting their needs well into the future. Now, in August, we successfully closed our acquisition of Aldevron, and we're thrilled to officially welcome the team to Danaher. Aldevron is a leading producer of high-quality plasmid DNA, mRNA, and proteins, and provides a fantastic beachhead for us in our genomic medicine enterprise. We're seeing the rapid development of gene and cell therapies, DNA, and RNA vaccines, and gene editing technologies, and Aldevron expand our capabilities in these areas to ultimately help our customers bring more life-saving therapies and vaccines to market faster. We're really excited about the quality, the scale, the turnaround time, and the reputation that Aldevron brings to the Danaher portfolio. Now in Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 28.5% led by more than 60% growth at Cepheid. Each of our other major diagnostic businesses, Beckman Coulter, Radiometer, and Leica Biosystems grew low-to-mid teens in the quarter as clinical diagnostic activity and patient volumes around the world largely returned to pre -pandemic levels. In respiratory testing at Cepheid, we further expanded manufacturing capacity, which enabled the team to produce and ship approximately 16 million cartridges during the quarter. COVID-only test accounted for approximately 80% of those shipment, and our 4-in-1 combination tests for COVID-19, Flu-A and B, and RSV represented approximately 20%. In non respiratory core growth, Cepheid was up double-digits as well, led by demand for hospital acquired infections, sexual health, and urology testing. We also saw strong growth in our installed base, as system placements continue to exceed pre -pandemic rate. And we believe the team's thoughtful placement of the GeneXpert and Infinity systems over the last 18 months is setting up Cepheid very well for future growth opportunities. First move to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 7% with core revenue up 7.5%. Water quality grew mid-single-digits, and our Product Identification platform was up low double-digits. Across our water quality businesses, we saw good underlying market strength, particularly in food and beverage and various industrial applications as activity returned to more normal level. Municipal projects picked up given the improving funding environment and as more customers return to in-person work. Now on product identification, both VIDEOJET and our packaging and color management businesses were up low double-digits in the quarter. Comparable stirrings across consumables, service, and installed base growth was driven by more normalized levels of customer activity and investments. We believe that our ability to meet our customers needs, particularly on the equipment side at VIDEOJET, enabled us to gain market share and expand our industry-leading installed base printers. So with that as a backdrop for what we saw this quarter, let's spend some time going through regional and end-market trends. Most major regions and countries around the world are largely back to pre -pandemic activity levels. Customers have adapted to the current operating environment and protocols and broadly resumed in-person commercial activities and site access. Now this is reflected in the strong results we've seen across the U.S., Europe, and China. And this momentum is also reflected in our strong order book growth w which is trending above revenue growth. Now we're mindful of potential COVID-19 variants or outbreaks and selective lockdown. But we're not currently seeing any material negative impact from these scenarios. And while we are seeing some global supply chain constraints, we're leveraging the Danaher Business System tools like daily management and actively working with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate any impact. Across Life Sciences, we're seeing robust customer activity and demand across all major end market. Lab and other site access is largely back to pre -COVID levels, and we're seeing this through more normalized productivity levels, installations, and project initiations driven by a strong funding environment. Now, Biopharma continues to lead the way as the number of life-saving biologic and genomic-based therapies and development and production continues to rise, and it's augmented by the ongoing work around COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. And at our recent Investor Day, we spent time covering how well-positioned we are to support this complex life changing work that our customers are pursuing. Our combined bio-processing portfolio across Cytiva and Pall Biotech is the broadest offering in the industry with leading positions in upstream and downstream applications. And we further support our customers with best-in-class scientific services, partnering to solve their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale. And our global reach enabled us to reliably and consistently meet our customers' needs. Now, in addition to the industry-wide opportunities in biologics and genomic -based medicine, we continue to see significant demand related to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Our customers are working to address emerging variants and increased global supply. And given that only about a third of the global population has been vaccinated, we believe we'll see durable growth in this Biopharma segment for the foreseeable future. We continue to expect about $2 billion of COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue in 2021. And since we spoke at our Investor Day, we now expect to enter 2022 with approximately $2 billion in COVID-related backlog versus our previous expectation of $1.5 billion of backlog. This increase is driven by the recent enhanced visibility for booster shots and the likelihood of vaccine availability for children under 12 years old in the US. Moving to the clinical diagnostic market, non - COVID testing volumes are essentially back to pre -pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening, and other elective procedures. In Molecular Diagnostics, strong global demand persists for Cepheid point-of-care PCR respiratory testing, as a result of the Delta variant and outbreak, along with lower vaccination rates in many regions. As I mentioned earlier, we shipped approximately 16 million respiratory tests during the third quarter, and we now expect to ship approximately 55 million tests in 2021 versus our prior expectation of 50 million. As we head into the traditional respiratory virus season, we're hearing from customers that they expect this to be a much more active season than last year's, in preparation their preferences for our four-in-one combination tests. So we're seeing an uptick in demand for those cartridges, particularly given the recent outbreak of RSV across the U.S. Cepheid 's 4-in-1 test was also recently approved with a third gene target for SARS-CoV-2 detection, ensuring it can continue to accurately detect future COVID-19 viral mutations and reinforcing Cepheid's competitive advantage in the respiratory testing market. Now moving to the applied market. Customer activity has largely rebounded to pre -pandemic levels, which we see in robust order rates across both consumables and equipment. In the global municipal market, consumables demand remained solid and the pace of instrument oriented project activity continues to pick up with the improving funding environment and broad return to work. Now, let's look ahead to our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver fourth quarter core revenue growth in the low to mid-teens range with high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business, and a mid-to-high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall through of approximately 40% in the fourth quarter, a similar level to what we achieved in the third quarter. Now for the full-year of 2021, we now expect to deliver more than 20% core tail wind and our base business will each contribute more than 10% to our 2021 core revenue growth rate. So to wrap up, we're proud to deliver another terrific results here in the third quarter. Our performance is a testament to the power of our unique portfolio, the strength of our end markets and our team's commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. And this unique combination differentiates Danaher today, and it reinforces our opportunities ahead for sustainable, long-term, outperformance. So with that, back over to you, Matt. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Emma, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Rainer Blair : Hey, good morning, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Hey. Rainer, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more on China. There seems to be growing noise on pressure, local competition. It seems to particularly be impacting some of the Diagnostics tenders with that process getting pushed out from the provinces. Are you seeing anything there for Beckman or Cepheid? I know China was up 20% overall, but I'm just curious if there's any pressure on the Diagnostics business based on what you're seeing? Rainer Blair : Sure. So let me start with -- we are not seeing any material impact related to some of the tenders or some of the other things that we hear out of China. In fact, the Anhui Province tender is really an exception in diagnostics and actually more common in other industries, and we'll see this kind of thing from time-to-time, but it's neither unexpected nor do we see it as material. But what we're seeing generally in China is really very consistent with what we've seen over the past several years. China has been very forthcoming with its Made in China 2025 Initiative as well as several others, all of which we see quite aligned with our strategy. Starting with our portfolio, which is clearly aligned with the healthy China 2030 agenda, where you see the need for both improved Diagnostics solutions as well as Life Sciences research and bioprocessing, as well as the desire to protect the environment where water quality really plays big, as well as the desire to improve and protect the food supply where we see PID playing large as well. We think we're really ideally positioned here to meet the needs of where China is going. Now, at the same time for years, we have been investing in China as our business gains scale to ultimately localize our production. And that's been the case here for some time, positioning us very well in China, and that will continue to be the case going forward as our businesses continue to gain scale there. Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's helpful. Supply chain, you flagged some constraints, obviously, you guys are generally very good at kind of mitigating any impact here. But I'm curious as you look out over the next couple of quarters, are there areas where maybe you are more or less concerned around supply chain that you might flag? Rainer Blair : We haven't really seen a material impact on our ability to meet our customers' demand, but we are seeing some modest inflationary and supply chain pressures in certain areas just to name a couple, of course, electronic components, freight, and logistics and some labor shortages. But really this is where the Danaher Business System is a differentiator for us in this environment. In fact, despite the additional work that ensues, we see this really as an opportunity for ourselves to differentiate with our DBS toolset, for instance with daily management, which brings our cross-functional teams together on a daily basis, drive disciplined execution and accountability, as well as the sense of urgency in real-time problem solving. And at the same time of course, we're qualifying additional suppliers and building safety stocks. So, this is how we make sure that Danaher continues to not only meet its customer expectations, but also has opportunity to gain share. Now at the same time, of course, we see some inflationary pressures and we're offsetting those with more active cadence, of price increases, and those would also be incrementally larger than in the past, as well as freight and fuel surcharges. So, on the one hand, we're driving as always to reduce our cost of goods sold. At the same time, we take additional offsets with moving on some of these surcharges and price increases I mentioned. I think also importantly, to note here that this is not a top down process. The Danaher operating companies have this process muscle and are able to execute effectively whether that's ensuring the security of the supply chain or whether that's ensuring that we can offset cost increases via price and other methods. And ultimately, we think that differentiates us and we think we are gaining share as a result of that in PID water quality, Cytiva and Pall, Radiometer and elsewhere. Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's great. And then before I hop off, just one on Cepheid , you're exceeding your targets here in the near-term. Should we assume your estimates for 2022 are still intact? I think you talked about 45 million tests before or have you kind of revisited those as well? Rainer Blair : That's correct, Tycho. We're really pleased that the team was able to ship more again here in the third quarter with the capacity increases, and demand still exceeds our ability to supply. But for today's view, 45 million cartridges for 2022 is our point of view. Tycho Peterson : Perfect. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Tycho. Operator : We'll go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Good morning, Rainer. Congrats on another impressive print here. Just one on testing here. I think I heard the number 55 million tests for '21. The implied Q4 number, I think is about 15 million. That's a sequential step-down from 3Q. I'm curious, just given the testing trends, whether that step-down makes sense and any change to your -- I think your prior expectation was 45 million tests for fiscal '22. Is that still relevant given the current run-rate? Rainer Blair : Sure. Thanks Vijay. So, the way to think about the fourth quarter here in terms of testing, is we would expect also 16 million cartridges in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw in Q3. While we're always working to increase capacity, we think 16 million cartridges is the right way to think about it. And of course, if you add up the quarters, let's call it about 55 million, I wouldn't want you thinking about a step down here in Q4 for Cepheid. That's not the case. Now as you look forward to 2022, we still think that 45 million cartridges where we sit today, is the right way to think about it. And as we come to our fourth-quarter earnings call in January, we'll revisit the topic then. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And now my second question, Rainer. This is maybe a bigger picture question. I think at your Analyst Day, you updated Cytiva outlook as high singles. Now, when you look at your peers in the Biopharma space, most of them are in the double-digit range. Is there anything different about your Cytiva business mix versus your peers and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Cytiva gaining share versus peers? Rainer Blair : So to start with, the Cytiva and the Poll Biotech businesses together are by far the most complete portfolio in the marketplace. And we continue to see pockets where we're taking share because we've been able to invest not only in capacity, but our customers really appreciate the scientific capability and the help that they get from Cytiva and Pall in solving the challenges that are associated with making biologics of high-quality with high yields at the targeted costs. So we really see ourselves in an advantage position here and believe that we continue to take share whether that's on a quarterly or on an annual basis, that's for sure the case. Now, as we think about the long-term growth, and perhaps our timelines needs to be aligned here. As we think of long-term growth, you might recall, when we acquired Cytiva, we thought this was more of a fixed percent type of growth business. And what we've seen here is that certainly the growth of this business is rerated higher. And certainly in the pandemic, it's quite a bit higher. Once again, as we think about the long term, we think it's prudent to think about a business at that scale in a high single-digit. And we think that will compare very favorably with any other business out there in the short, medium, and long term. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Rainer. And just to summarize that, there's no reason to think Cytiva growth should be below market. Is that a fair summary? Rainer Blair : We continue to believe that we'll take share now and in the future. Vijay Kumar : Thank you, guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : We'll go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Rainer Blair : Derrick, good morning. Derik De Bruin : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I have a couple of ones. Can we talk a little bit about operating leverage as we go into '22 and '23? You guys are investing really heavily in R&D. You're doing a lot to drive innovation in the business. How can we think about OP leverage as we go in there and then, just to get a sense of where the margins are going to come on? Rainer Blair : Sure. Derrick, as you know, we have been and as you just mentioned, investing very significantly in the business. This is not only the case in capital expenditures, where we're investing in our manufacturing network throughout the world. But we've also been investing significantly in research and development in feet on the street to drive proprietary innovation in the short and long-term, as well as to ensure that we can continue to drive share gains with our direct business model. Now as we think about the operating leverage, you know that our fall through here had been in the 40% range. And we think that's a good way to think about the quarter here as well. In the long term, historically, our fall-through has been more in the 35% range. And we think that's probably the better way to think about fall -through for the long term, just because we want to find that balance of reinvesting in the business, as well as driving profitability expansion. And we think that Flywheel works for us. Mid-single-digit plus growth on the one hand; on the other hand, 50 to 75 basis points of operating margin expansion, free cash flow conversion over net income over a 100%. All of that then to drive double-digit plus EPS growth. And when you couple that with our current balance sheet of positioning with our bias to deploy capital towards M&A, we think that sets us up very nicely here, both from an operating leverage perspective, as well as driving our growth franchise forward. Derik De Bruin : Great. Can we talk a little bit about the analytical instrumentation sales? I'm curious just on how SCIEX is comparing to 2019 and some of the other instrumentation. And specifically, I'd like to know developed world versus China and what that is -- just trying to gauge overall, are we seeing accelerating analytical demand from 2019 versus where we are today? Rainer Blair : Well, let me start with that. We are seeing accelerated analytical demand versus prior year today. That's the case in all of our more instrument bias -- businesses and that is certainly the case for SCIEX as well. We do see that the funding environment labs opening up are helpful here and have accelerated instrument demand going forward. And SCIEX has done very nice here with over mid-team core growth in the quarter and that also read through to China as well. SCIEX in particular, as you know, has been on a great streak of -- and continuous streak of innovation launching at the ZenoTOF 7600, as well as the 7500 Triple Quad an d Echo MS, and is not only benefiting from the tailwinds of and attractive funding environment, which we see here in this year and certainly in the second half of 2021. But they're also benefiting through this innovation that is really allowing our scientists to answer new questions and that's resulting in share gain. Matt Mc Grew : This is Matt. Just to put some numbers to what Rainer said. I mean, if you look at SCIEX in particular, on a two-year stack, you're talking about high single-digits here in ' 20and '21, which is that's actually better than where they were in '18 and '19 on a two-year stack. So I think like Rainer said, we're seeing some pretty nice acceleration, really new product-driven as well, but it's been a really good story here for the last couple of years. Derik De Bruin : Great. And if I can sneak in one more. The COVID vaccine backlog for '22. Is there even some additional upside there? Is that already committed orders, or is that more tied to your instrumentations on [Indiscernible] etc. Rainer Blair : We are close to those $2 billion of backlog and for the bio-process business for 2022 today and certainly expect to be there by the end of the year. We think that sets us up pretty well. We will see what 2022 brings and we'll talk more about that in January. But the fact that we've up that backlog by 500 million here going into 2022, we think is a good sign for things to come. Matt Mc Grew : Derik, so definitely, those are committed orders. That is not a -- Derik De Bruin : Great, Jack. Thank you. That's what we're working. Thanks. Matt Mc Grew : Yes. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Good morning. Rainer and Matt and Matt and John. Thanks for taking my question. I am kind of curious. I mean, logistics, prices, and labor cost, inflation or challenges and all the stuff doesn't seem to really have impacted you guys much. Maybe a little bit at ENAS. And you've made a comment, Rainer on capturing price, but it looks like price was sequentially flat. Is that something that you would expect price to be a little bit more dynamic going forward or is it just kind of a mix impact to some products where priced just doesn't need to go up? Rainer Blair : We're about a 150 basis points up year-over-year and we continue to move price increases through the system. So I think you're going to continue to see that filtering through here going forward, Scott. So mix plays a role as you suggest; timing is another one, but all of these actions are in the works and it takes some time to get through the system. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And the R&D -- the spend up 30%, is that -- is it headcount up 30% too or people are costing you more? How do you think about that and how do you think about getting productivity on that spend as making sure projects are focused and there's some sort of return on that investment? Rainer Blair : Scott, that's a great question. And the 30% increase is primarily related to a number of points. One, of course, you have more people working on more projects. But in terms of the productivity, the way to think about that is any project that we do, has its business case and we ensure that that productivity to the delivery of that business case makes sense for us. So we view this, of course, as an investment in the future that ultimately drive defensible proprietary share gain through research and development. And the increased comes in terms of people that comes in terms of additional equipment, testing equipment that's required. It comes in terms of additional alpha and beta system that are out in the field with our customers. So myriad ways that we invest that in order to drive innovation. Scott Davis : Okay. Good luck, Rainer. Thank you and congrats on a great year so far, guys. Thanks. That's [Indiscernible]. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Scott. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Brennan with Cowen. Rainer Blair : Morning, Dan. Dan Brennan : [Indiscernible], thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions here. I wanted to ask as a follow-up to the first question on this bio process. You maintained the outlook for vaccine therapeutic contribution this year. Just wondering, is there capacity for you to exceed that in terms of is there demand for that or your capacity constrained for 2021? And then related to that, as we think about 2022, you've already discussed the 2 billion firm order book, but how do we think about the contribution within that from boosters and from kids to that. I think that in previously, you had boosters included in that. So maybe that's the first question. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Very good. Well, let's start with the topic of the contribution that's in the 2 billion. In fact, we did not include the kid 12 and below into our $1.5 billion original backlog estimate for 2022. That and, of course, now the approval of boosters for various groups of the population is really what is driving that increase from $1.5 to $2 billion of backlog for 2022. What it doesn't include is the approval of these vaccines for kids 12 and younger, for example, outside of the US. That's something that is still in the future, and there's not sufficient clarity for us to start thinking about that in quantitative terms, but that's something that would be excluded in that. Now coming back to your capacity question, as you likely are aware and as we talked about also in our Analyst Day, we have been investing in capacity expansions in the biotech business now, for some time. In fact, we ensured that the investment continued even prior to the closing of the acquisition from GE and we have continued with those investments that have come online here, nearly in a continuous fashion through the second half of 2020 and 2021. And we expect those capacities to continue to increase here going into 2022. So we feel very comfortable that we're able to meet our customers' requirements here now and going forward, and we think that differentiates us in the marketplace. And why, among other reasons, we are confident that we are taking share. Dan Brennan : Great, thanks, Rainer. And then as a follow-up, I know Matt discussed previously, a stack growth on, I believe is on Cytiva. I just wanted to understand a little bit in terms of stack-free overall business. I know the commentary throughout the conversation reflected business largely back to normal, which is great. But when we look at like the base growth ex - COVID then we consider like a stack, and this is clearly very imprecise. But in Q3, that base growth on a 2-year average basis was around 4, maybe a little bit below that. And I believe in Q4, the high single-digit base guidance implies like a 2-year stack that might be closer to 3. And this is compared against what we consider Danaher 's underlying growth rate probably somewhere in the 6% to 8% range when things get back to normal. So just trying to reconcile some of this underlying stack and is it just conservatism right now? Are things back to -- Rainer Blair : Yes. Dan Brennan : -- normal or maybe it's just too imprecise to do this analysis with COVID? Thank you. Matt Mc Grew : Yes. Dan, let me just give you the numbers because I think may be disconnect here. I think the simple frame for Q4 is like we, talked about, we increased our expectations from low double-digits to low to mid-teens. And like you said, we are up in the base business. We think the base business is going to be high-single-digits in Q4, which as you said, was probably a little closer to 10% here in Q3. And I would look at that delta between kind of high-single-digits and 10 and say that that's really just more a function of kind of prudent planning given the current operating environment and some of the things we've talked about. In particular, you think about Q4 and logistic challenges, etc. that might be there. So I think we're just trying to give a little bit of -- from a planning perspective, high-single-digits from about the10% we've seen, but really not much of a change here in the environment. Dan Brennan : Okay. Great, thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Jack Meehan with Nephron. Rainer Blair : Morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to a little bit more color on the funding environment, was curious as you look into the fourth quarter, what customers might be telling you around the potential for a budget flush and what is the guidance assume versus historical patterns? Rainer Blair : So Jack, first of all, we see the funding environment across the board improving. So if we start with yes, we do see customer activity increasing, we do see more work occurring at the workplace, and with that, more projects being tackled both in the capital as well as operating investment categories. And we would expect that to continue to improve here going forward as the economy continues to pick up speed and return to normality. As we think about Life Sciences, research funding is up, whether that's government funding, whether that's venture capital funding, or whether that is Biopharma funding from the pharmaceutical companies. We've see n a step-up here in an effort to take advantage of the opportunities that new breakthroughs and technologies that you're all aware of, as a result of COVID, all -- creating a great deal more awareness of the possibilities here in therapeutics. We see, generally speaking, a great environment in the Life Science area. Bioprocess, we talked about with continued capacity increases to meet the needs of the very fast-growing therapeutic pipeline. We talked about the fact that monoclonal antibody pipeline is up 50% in terms of the number of projects over the last five-years. Genomic gene cell therapy pipeline is up an order of magnitude to 10x versus 5 years ago. That's creating very healthy drive here whether that's in the research - side of Life Sciences or in the bioprocessing. And then when you come back to diagnostics, patient volumes are nearly at full rate pre -pandemic rates, if you will, in nearly every geography. And we continue to, of course, the COVID driving additional diagnostic demand and so across the board a very positive funding environment. And we would expect that the one of the other budget is going to be taken advantage of here in the fourth quarter. We'll see. There are a number of different perspective there but the environment is generally very positive. Jack Meehan : That's great. And then as a follow-up, just curious on Aldevron on how the early integration feedback's going. And as I look at the fourth quarter, you've given us the core guidance. What do you have M&A contributing? 2.5 points or so? Does that sound right? Matt Mc Grew : Yeah that would be probably -- sorry. Go ahead, Rainer. Rainer Blair : No, go ahead. Go ahead, Matt, please. Matt Mc Grew : The M&A contribution is probably going to be about -- it was 40 here in Q3. But I think you're probably pretty close with what you've got, 40 million. Rainer Blair : So we -- actually coming back to the front end of your question there, we couldn't be happier with both Aldevron as an entity, but even more importantly, the team in Aldevron that have embraced joining the Danaher family are embracing and pulling hard on the Danaher Business System and are really focused on driving and growing their business. There's plenty of opportunity as you likely know, in the core businesses of Aldevron. And we see that. We see that in the order book. We see that in revenues. And we will see that also in their earnings contributions, all of which is running as we expected, when we updated during the acquisition. So we expect to see $400 million of revenue this year, growth rate in 20% plus range, and we expect to see $0.20 of EPS in year 1, growing to $0.30 of EPS in year 2. So Aldevron -- incredibly pleased with the motivation and the engagement of the team and the important work that they're doing. And proud to have them as a part of the Danaher family. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Good morning. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow up on Jack's question on Aldevron. You guys had mentioned when you made the acquisition that they were relatively underexposed to international and I know you're -- you've got a lot of things going on with the integration. But as you think about expanding Aldevron footprint internationally, how are you thinking about that and are there any kind of timelines that you have for that? Rainer Blair : Very much a part of the investment hypothesis is to expand Aldevron's activities, as you say, internationally. And we, of course, are focusing first and foremost now on the transition into Danaher and are helping the team with their number 1 priority which are to take care of the expansion that they are finalizing as we speak. And we're already in the process of the next set of those expansions. And so in terms of timeline, we'll talk about that when that becomes something that's on the top of the agenda. But currently it's all about ensuring an effective transition, taking care of our customers, transitioning the team on to DBS and they're incredibly excited about that. And of course, subsequent expansions as we go forward. Matt Sykes : Great, thanks and just maybe just one follow-up. You're obviously generating impressive amount of free cash flow and even very active in M&A, but what are your thoughts in terms of inorganic investments as you move forward, looking at where you are in terms of leverage and what you want to accomplish? Rainer Blair : We really like the way we're positioned. Both in terms of the franchises and the platforms that we have as well as how we're thinking about our earnings Flywheel. I talked about that earlier in the call. Driving that mid-single-digit plus growth, the double-digit EPS expansion, and of course then having a very strong balance sheet position in order to continue to prioritize capital allocation towards M&A. And as we think about our balance sheet position this year, after the Aldevron deal, by the end of the year, we should probably be back to about 2 times net debt -- 2 turns of EBITDA over net debt. And we think that puts us in great position and our funnels are active. And we continue to work as we always have at Danaher to ensure that we have the next deal ahead of us and take advantage of the balance sheet that we have. We're very well positioned there. We feel good about where we sit. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks very much. Rainer Blair : Thank you. Operator : We will take our final question from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Luke. Luke Sergott : Morning, how are you? Thanks for squeezing me in. So just quickly on the backlog, and you think you're raising your guidance there or your expectations of what you're expecting in 20 -- to exit the year. Can you give us a sense of the mix between the vaccine and the therapeutic revenue, or how that order book is shaping up? Rainer Blair : Sure. Sure. So rough numbers here, Luke, thinking about 85% vaccine, 15% therapeutics. That's roughly -- those are the rough numbers there. Luke Sergott : Okay, that's helpful. And then, we were expecting a little more balance between the 4-in-1 and the just pure COVID tests. Can you give us a sense of the order there, the -- how the orders are starting to shape up ahead of the flu season? It makes sense that we haven't had flu season yet, but -- and then really how -- trying to figure out how to think about the first half of '21 through that winter season. Rainer Blair : In terms of the mix here in Q3, we saw 80% COVID only 20% 4-in-1 test. And as you think about Q4 here, we see that heading towards the 50-50. A good way to think about it as 50% of the COVID -only test in Q4 and 50% of the 4-in-1. Now as we think about the first half of next year, I think the best way to think about it right now is the 45 million tests that we've been talking about. And generally speaking, the same kind of mix ratios that we have within flu seasons and outside of flu season. So within flu season, probably around 50/50 is the best way to think about it : 4-in-1 and COVID only. And then if we're outside of the flu season, probably closer to 80-20. Luke Sergott : Got you. That's really helpful. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Got it. Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the program back over to Matt Gugino. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Emma. Thank you, everyone for joining us today, and we are around all day to get your questions. Rainer Blair : Thank you, everybody. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highlighted by outstanding core revenue and earnings growth as well as strong free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the strength of our base business across the portfolio, which was up low double digits for the year. And we believe our accelerated innovation and capacity expansion initiatives has helped us capture market share at a number of our businesses. Now these results are a testament to our team of 80,000 associates and their outstanding execution in what has been a challenging operating environment. Despite the uncertainty that has come to characterize life for all of us, throughout the pandemic, our associates are showing up big every day, working longer shifts, launching breakthrough products in record time and going above and beyond to support our customers, and they remain committed as ever to executing with the Danaher Business System. Really, their dedication to serving our customers and the global community is as humbling as it is inspiring, and we're grateful for their invaluable contribution. The circumstances over the last several years have also shined a light on the high-quality, market-leading franchises and technologies that now comprise Danaher. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action today through higher growth in margins, stronger cash flow and a higher percentage of recurring revenue. We're exceptionally well positioned to continue this trajectory going forward, and we see a very bright future ahead indeed. So with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2021 financial results. We delivered 25% core revenue growth, 560 basis points of core operating margin expansion, nearly 60% adjusted earnings per share growth and over $7 billion of free cash flow. We deployed $11 billion of capital towards acquisitions, closing 14 deals across all four of our platforms. The largest acquisition, Aldevron, joined our Life Sciences segment in August, providing a fantastic beachhead for us in the important frontier of genomic medicine. It's just a great example of how we're using strategic M&A to enhance our capability and bring greater value to our customers. Now throughout the year, we also made significant organic investments to accelerate innovation across our businesses. Our R&D spend was up approximately 30% year-over-year and is now more than $1.7 billion annually. New products, which as the SCIEX ZenoTOF 7600 and Triple Quad 7500 and Leica Biosystems Aperio GT 450 digital pathology slide scanner are driving share gains in their respective markets through proprietary innovation while further enhancing our growth trajectory. Now total capital expenditures were $1.3 billion for the year, which reflects substantial investments to expand production capacity across our businesses, particularly at Cepheid, Pall and Cytiva. In bioprocessing, I'm really happy to report that our new single-use technology plants in South Carolina and Beijing and our cell culture media expansion in Utah all came online in the fourth quarter. And at Cepheid, we more than doubled our production capacity for respiratory tests in 2021. For near term, we believe these investments have been critical to support customer demand, and it helped us achieve meaningful market share gains. And they're equally important in the long term to support the significant growth opportunities we see ahead in these very attractive end markets. And now let's spend some time on the fourth quarter results. Our sales were $8.1 billion, and we delivered 19.5% core revenue growth with strong contributions from all three segments. We saw broad-based strength across our base business, which was up approximately 10% in the quarter. And geographically, both have developed and high-growth markets were up approximately 20% led by nearly 25% growth in North America and high teens growth in China. Gross profit margin was 60.7%, and our operating profit margin of 26.4% was up 270 basis points, including 240 basis points of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.69 were up approximately 30%. And now for the full year, we generated more than $7 billion of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year. In fact, our free cash flow to net income conversion was 112% from the full year and it marks the 30th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher. So now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segment. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 20.5% with core revenue up 17%. Now these strong results were broad-based with most major operating companies achieving low double-digit or better core growth. In fact, Aldevron delivered over 30% revenue growth in the quarter and finished the year with approximately $400 million in total revenue. That business is off to a great start as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance out of the gate. Our core revenue growth in our processing businesses continued to outpace segment level results with Cytiva and Pall Biotech, both up more than 25%. Non-COVID related bioprocessing trends remained strong with our businesses growing low double digits again this quarter. We continue to support significant customer activity across the development and production of COVID vaccines and therapeutics, which drove $2 billion of revenue in 2021. Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 29% led by greater than 75% core growth at Cepheid. Non-COVID clinical diagnostic activity across all our operating companies, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer, and Leica Biosystems collectively drove high single-digit core growth as patient and testing volumes largely remained at or near pre-pandemic levels. And we also saw an acceleration in demand that crosses non-respiratory menu, led by telehealth, hospital-acquired infections and urology testing. Cepheid produced and shipped approximately $19 million of respiratory test cartridges during the quarter. This dropped the total number of respiratory tests shipped in 2021 to approximately 16 million cartridges, more than 10x the number of tests produced and shipped in 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic. In fact, our four-in-one combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 50% of Q4 respiratory test shipments, while our COVID-only test accounted for the remainder. Now let's move on to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 4%, with 7.5% core revenue growth. Our water quality and product identification platforms both delivered high single-digit core growth for the quarter. Now across our water quality businesses, strength was broad-based globally across industrial and municipal end markets. Customer activity accelerated with the support of a strong funding environment and many projects that were put on hold during the pandemic have now resumed. Country delivered low double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out its 53rd consecutive year of growth. This is a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class commercial execution and commitment to continuous improvement, with truly a differentiating combination, which has driven consistent market outperformance. In Product Identification, our packaging and color management businesses were up mid-single digits and marking and coding was up approximately 10%. Videojet had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, led by strong demand in industrial and food and beverage end markets. So with that as a backdrop for what we saw in the quarter, let me highlight the trends we're seeing, both geographically and in our end markets. So a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity is driving healthy customer demand across most major geographies. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen throughout both the developed and high growth markets and our strong order book growth, which continues to trend above revenue growth. While certain regions have implemented targeted lockdowns to address recent COVID-19 outbreaks, we're not seeing any widespread decline in our customer activity. Now given the size and scope of our business, we're certainly not immune to ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, but we're proactively addressing these challenges across Danaher, leveraging the Danaher Business System and tools such as daily management and working closely with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact. We're also using DBS to accelerate price action and manage cost pressures. In fact, we've achieved nearly 150 basis points of price each of the last three quarters, which is approximately double our historical price realization. Now in Life Sciences. We're seeing robust demand across all major end markets. Lab and customer site access is holding at pre-pandemic levels, evidenced by more normalized customer productivity, equipment installations and project initiation supported by a strong funding environment. Biopharma continues to be our strongest performing end market within the Life Sciences business, while shifts in treatment towards biologics as the standard of care and the accelerating focus on genomic therapies are driving significant investments in research, development and production capacity across the sector. And we believe we're well positioned to support this work across our $7.5 billion bioprocessing franchise. Now in addition, we continue see significant demand related to development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. And we expect this activity to persist longer term. Our customers are planning for ongoing production with the assumption that there will be an enduring need for effective treatment and prevention as the world transitions to approaching COVID-19 as an endemic virus. And more broadly, our customers increasingly view the potential applications of new mRNA modalities, including vaccines and other therapeutics as an important area for future investments. In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes remain at or near pre-pandemic levels. Our customers have largely adapted their protocols and procedures to manage through recurring outbreaks, allowing them to continue wellness checks, routine screening and other diagnostic procedures. While selective lockdowns are causing modest disruptions in certain regions like pockets of China and Europe, we're not experiencing any material widespread negative impact from these measures. In Molecular Diagnostics, global demand persists for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR respiratory test further heightened as a result of the recent global surge of the Omicron variant. Additionally, we're seeing a more active respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, driving customers' preference for our four-in-one combination test, and we expect both of these trends to continue into the first quarter. Now in light of these dynamics and conversations we're having with our customers about their expectations for the upcoming year, we anticipate shipping the same number of respiratory tests in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter and approximately 50 million sets for all of 2020. In 2021, Cepheid placed a record 10,000 new GeneXpert system bringing the total install base to more than 40,000 systems worldwide. The team's thoughtful approach to placing systems throughout the pandemic is focused on both the near and long-term value this technology can bring to our customers. More recently, we've seen several existing health care system and integrated delivery network customers adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to their patients, facilitating faster diagnostics and treatment decisions. The scalability and unique architecture of the GeneXpert where the same test cartridges are used on higher and lower throughput instruments with the broadest test menu in the market provides our customers with the confidence that they will achieve consistent reference lab quality results, whether they're testing in an urgent care clinic or a central hospital lab. So now looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be in an endemic disease, we believe that the point-of-care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. Given Cepheid's leading test menu and install base, combined with an advantaged positioning around speed, accuracy and workflow, we believe Cepheid will continue to gain share in an endemic environment. So moving on to the applied markets, customer activity is largely back to pre-pandemic levels, which we see a robust order rates for both consumables and equipment. In fact, project-oriented activity is accelerating with an improving funding environment and more normalized site access has prompted the resumption of many projects and installations that were put on hold in the throes of the pandemic. So now let's look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we will now include the impact of COVID vaccine and therapeutic-related revenue as part of our base business core revenue growth. This change is driven by our greater confidence in the durability of our COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue as the virus turns endemic. So now for the first quarter and full year 2022, we expect our base business core revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of 35% to 40% in the first quarter and for the full year 2022, up from historical and pre-pandemic rate between 30% and 35%. So now to wrap up, 2021 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to deliver outstanding financial performance, all while supporting our customers and directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action through faster growth, expanded margins, stronger cash flow and higher recurring revenue. We're a better, stronger company today and there is tremendous runway ahead for us to continue building upon this foundation. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force, our talented team and resilient portfolio of businesses, we believe Danaher will continue generating sustainable long-term shareholder value for years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Thank you. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Ashley, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Rainer, you guided for the base business to grow high single digit. Can you maybe just give us latest thoughts on vaccine and therapies? I know you previously talked about this $2 billion backlog heading into the year. So have any of the assumptions around vaccines and therapies changed? Rainer Blair : So just to confirm, that's right. For 2022, we're guiding the base business to high single digits. And no, our assumptions as it relates to the vaccine and therapeutics business have not changed. We saw continued strength in our orders. In fact, orders exceeded our sales here in Q4, and we continued to build backlog. At the same time, we have to say that from a roughly 70% comp, we were down about mid-teens in terms of the orders growth. Nonetheless, orders still outpace sales. We built backlog and we're looking forward to roughly flat sales in the bioprocessing business for vaccine and therapeutic revenues in 2022. Now the core business, so in other words, the non-vaccine and therapeutic-related business for COVID, we expect that to continue to grow, of course, in the low double-digit area as has been the case here for many quarters. Tycho Peterson : And have any of the Aldevron assumptions changed? I know you previously talked about $500 million this year, growing greater than 20%. Rainer Blair : They're right on the mark $500 million is a good number. That's kind of growth and slightly better than we expected here, closing the year off right around $400 million. So, Aldevron is right where we think we should be and performing at our expectations. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Maybe last one for McGrew. Environmental and applied operating margins were down quite a bit, I think, 410 basis points. Can you maybe just touch on what drove that decline? Matt McGrew : Yes, sure. Like you said, it was down 410 here in the quarter. It's probably three things. I would say, first, that's probably the area that we accelerated the investment spend the most in the fourth quarter, given obviously, a pretty strong print here across the entire portfolio. I think we took an opportunity in the fourth quarter to kind of overcharge a little bit of the investment there at EAS. So I think that's probably the first thing. I think the second thing is the supply chain. The challenges I would say there are probably modestly more pronounced at than they are elsewhere, Tycho. There's a kind of a high number of legacy products here that probably, I would say, have more components. And really what's happening is kind of the specialty components are a little bit harder to procure, especially in this environment that we're seeing. So largely offsetting that with daily management and doing some spot buys and some other product redesigns, et cetera, but I think a little bit more kind of supply chain issues there. And then lastly, I think if you think about -- there was a bit of mix issue here, too, with Trojan, which is a bit lower margin business being up, I think it was even north of 20% in the quarter. And so, I think despite that though, the good news is, like I said, I think teams doing a pretty good job using DBS to drive it from what we think and what we've seen here, it looks like even because of all that, I think we took some share here in Q4 and definitely in Q1, and that's really a result of being able to get through those challenges and still meet customer demand. Operator : And we would like to take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Thanks for taking my question. This is Mike calling for Derik. First of all, focus on Cepheid, both in '22 and post-pandemic. Given you're saying 19 million tests again in 1Q, it seems like you're assuming a pretty short drop off in 2Q, 3Q. And then you set up pretty confident duration, the COVID being endemic now, the POC market expanding spiffy going forward being to keep market share. So could you give us some more color on continued market share gains, the 10,000 boxes you place this year, so what are your expectations going forward? And just is that $50 million testing, does that sort of assume that that's going to be the run rate beyond that? Or do you expect continued sort of deterioration in COVID revenues offset by the other [indiscernible]? Rainer Blair : I'll start with, as you know, the situation around COVID is incredibly dynamic, right? It started with the assumptions that we made around Delta and then Delta spiked, and we thought that might become the dominant variant and then Omicron came 60 days ago, spiked. So the environment is incredibly dynamic. But in the discussions that we have both with public health officials, but also with our customers, I think there's a couple of takeaways. The first one is that we do think that COVID is going to turn endemic and a lot of public health officials will talk about the end of 2023, perhaps the beginning of '24, being that time frame when we call it endemic with greater confidence. As we look at our customer feedback and what they see happening here, that's where we're triangulating for 2022 into the 50 million test area. And as we've talked about, we see our base business in 2022 growing at high single digits and eventually having as a result of a step down from to 60 to 50 in 2022, at 200 to 300 basis point headwind there. Now as you think about that going forward beyond 2022, we think there's -- and once again, in the discussions with our customers that there's still a likelihood that there will be a large respiratory testing business, much larger than pre-pandemic in '23 and beyond. And once again, in the early days, and this could change. It's so dynamic. But we're thinking that, that probably steps down again in 2023. And our working number there for now is right around 30 million tests. So, as we think about the year 2023 and COVID testing, we see that going from 50 million in 2022 to perhaps 2023, 30 million. But that's a number that, of course, there's a lot of dynamic. There's a lot to happen between now and then, but that's sort of the planning number that we're working with. And at the same time, as you think about 2023, we see our base business, of course, the primary aspect of our total business continuing to grow off the strength of our portfolio. We've rated our growth rate and discussed that at several occasions, so we feel really good about how we're moving forward and like the setup. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Really appreciate the color there. And maybe one for Matt. You had some color on the pricing power going forward. I think you called out 100 basis points price in the fourth quarter and throughout the second half of the last three quarters. Could you comment on how much further runway do you see in '22 if we continue to be in an inflationary environment to pass on price to your customers? Any pushback you're seeing yet in any of the end markets? And just in general, the comments on how the fall-through in the business, labor pressure, logistics, obviously, in the news a lot. So how are you navigating that this year and implications for margins for the year? Matt McGrew : Yes. Sure. No, I mean I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4. And I think that we've seen that for the last couple of quarters, I think that's a pretty good placeholder to put in for '22. Teams are obviously, over the last six months, we've been working harder to get that price. And I think you're seeing it show up. I mean it's basically 2x the price we used to get, kind of, call it, five, six quarters ago. So I guess it's a good place to start for '22. As far as margins go, just kind of maybe overall, I know we sort of put out a guide for '22, I call it, 35% to 40% fall through. And that's down a little bit from where we stand, kind of more in that 40% to 45%. I think that 35% to 40% kind of incorporates a little bit of what you're talking about. I think it's kind of in line with what we thought, frankly, our longer-term outlook was going to be. But if I think about year-over-year from '21 to '22, I think you're right I think a component of sort of the step down is going to be a little bit of the return to work and maybe some of the inflationary pressures that we see offset by price. The other piece really is going to be largely on the volume step-down that we see, and that's mostly going to be at kind of a mix type issue. So throw in some headwinds on share count and lets to sort of I'm thinking about the 40% to 45% in '21 going down to 35% to 40%. But I think the good news is that's pretty much in our long-term framework right where we thought. And I think it's also probably important to think about it. But even though we're seeing headwinds on the testing front this year, call it, 200 to 300 basis points, our COVID testing revenue is pretty much at the fleet average, right, which is why it's not a big step down for us. It's pretty much fleet average from a margin perspective. So I think that helps kind of as we navigate the headwinds. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hi, Rainer. Congrats on a solid print here. I guess one on just the guidance here, fiscal '22, some clarification. So your definition of core now includes vaccines, and I think that's comparable to how your largest peer looks at core organic. But vaccines, if I just understood you correctly, it's flattish year-on-year, which means your base Danaher ex-vaccine, that's really growing at the very high end of high single. Is that right way to think about the guidance here on the base business? And what's driving this trend? It looks like it's assuming perhaps bioprocessing growing double digits, that's well above your LRP. So I'm curious some comments on bioprocessing. Rainer Blair : Sure. So once again, just to level set, the base business includes bioprocessing for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. It's important to note that. And in fact, we see the entire base business growing both for the quarter and the full year at high single digits. And that's driven by a number of factors. One, as you just suggested, of course, the non-COVID bioprocessing business is still growing at the low double digits that we have seen here, and that continues to be strong. We also see our non-bioprocessing business, so as you think about our diagnostic businesses, as you think about our life science instruments and so forth, we see them growing very strongly on the back of the investments that we've made around innovation, additional feet on the street, and really driving the growth here. Keep in mind that portfolio transformation that we've talked about has re-rated our base business growth, and we continue to see that. We saw that here in the two-year stack in 2021, and you're seeing that here in the guide for 2022. Vijay Kumar : Understood. So I guess now we have clarity on what the mid-single digit plus, what the plus means. That's helpful, Rainer. Maybe one for Matt. The 35% to 40% incremental margin share, Matt. Is that sustainable going forward? Should we -- I guess my question is most of your peers who benefited from COVID tailwinds? There is a cliff here or perhaps a transition year. It seems like Danaher does not have a cliff here. Maybe talk about the sustainability of incrementals and why perhaps the all the drop down and co-tails shouldn't be a headwind for Danaher? Matt McGrew : Yes, I mean, I think that's right, Vijay. I think like I just kind of said, I mean, our COVID kind of revenues, both vaccine, therapeutic and the testing, it's more or less a fleet average, right? And so what I think you're seeing here and part of the reason we talked about the re-rating of the portfolio from a growth perspective, as I just mentioned lot, we've also talked about the fact that the portfolio is rerated from a margin perspective, too, right? We used to be more 30%, 35%. Now, we're 35%, 40%. And I think what you see here is that as we go forward and think about kind of what a margin profile looks like, I think I feel very comfortable with the 35% to 40% and the fact that, like you said, we'll have some revenue headwinds. We're going to have some volume headwinds and testing like we sort of laid out, and we can talk about '23, maybe if you're interested. But I think as we get to those headwinds, it won't be above the fleet average headwind, if you will, from a decremental perspective. So while it will be a headwind, and I think you can -- you obviously see that a little bit here in '22, from a margin perspective, it's not going to be overly burdensome. Operator : We'll take the next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Good morning everybody. Congrats on a great year overall. But anyways, Rainer, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about M&A given that growth assets seemingly are out of favor in public markets fairly meaningfully. Is that kind of gone down into private markets at all and helped you out on the valuation side much? If you can talk about that in the pipeline, please. Rainer Blair : Sure. Well, I mean, first to the environment that we see out there, this is an environment that over our history, we have thrived in, whether you want to call that anxiety or uncertainty or even in times of dislocation. We've always viewed this as a time of opportunity for ourselves. And there's examples of that. If you think back to the financial crisis now going back some years, we acquired SCIEX at that period of time. That's turned out to be a fantastic asset. The team has done a wonderful job. Also, if you think about some of the anxiety around Cepheid or the Pall deals there, that has been -- we couldn't be more proud of how the teams have performed there and turn those businesses into really real powerhouses. And so, we sit here in this environment with a rock-solid portfolio, an outstanding team and a strong balance sheet, a great deal of optionality. And we like that set up. And so, as we think about our funnels and to your question, they continue to be adaptive as ever. They cover the gamut, whether that's public or private, and we'll continue driving our M&A strategy and our bias towards allocating capital towards M&A as we have in the past. And that will happen when that attractive end market, that first-class asset with competitive advantage meets our financial hurdles here as has always been the case. So we like where we sit, and we like the set up. Scott Davis : That's helpful, Rainer. And Rainer, you talked about new product launches like Beckman. How has COVID impacted those launches? Is there a -- were these things perhaps that were pushed back a little bit because of COVID? Were they on schedule with the customer response and ability to get out and see the customer with that product? Has that all been altered or changed? And just a little bit of color there would be helpful? And then I'll pass it on. Rainer Blair : Sure. In our case, COVID has actually accelerated innovation for us. Of course, in the obvious sense in that we were able to pull forward the GeneXpert COVID-only test subsequently and very quickly thereafter the four-in-one. Those are sort of the obvious examples. But at the same time, you've noted that we increased our R&D expenditures by 30% up to $1.7 billion, which has manifested in that pulling forward innovation, accelerating it and getting those into the market. And examples were mentioned, the Triple Quad 7500, most sensitive Triple Quad in the market, the ZenoTOF outstanding. And then, of course, the GT 450 pathology slide imaging, fantastic launches here, all of which was accelerated by the pandemic, and we were able to turn that into real opportunity for us. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dan Brennan with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dan Brennan : I guess the first question, just on the vaccine therapeutics outlook now that you're including it in the base. We were assuming our model a pretty steep drop off in '23 and '24 just as we go from initial two dose regimens down to boosters, and booster uptake looks good, probably not going to be nearly as good as the initial vaccine. So I guess, first, first question, I mean is that reasonable to think there's going to be a healthy step down, number one? And then number two, the fact that you're including it in the base, just wondering, I know previously you've discussed IT but kind of high single digits, is that still fair to think about the high single digits now that you've got vaccine and therapeutics in the base? Rainer Blair : Sure. Well, let's start off with the why vaccine and therapeutics in the base. And that just comes from our belief of two things. One, that COVID-19 will be endemic in that there will be a continuous requirement for vaccination, and that is going to be a global requirement. We also think that new age groups will receive vaccination more broadly in the world's kids in particular. And as such, there is a strong recurring demand there, and that was discussed at some of the previous questions. But if we back up a minute here and we think about this longer term, I talked about our '22 guide here with high single-digit growth in our base business, and we talked about the 200 to 300 basis points of headwind coming from testing. As you think forward now, how does all that play out, let's say, in 2023? And once again, it's important to start with the base, which is at the center of your question, which is, okay, well, we have this rock solid portfolio that's transformed over the years, that's going to be mid-single-digit plus growth and is going to have a different earnings profile as well, as Matt just talked about. And then inside of that, of course, you do have vaccine and therapeutic revenues from COVID and that will continue. There are new therapeutics being developed and there are also a lot of additional vaccines that are still in the pipe. And then as you think about COVID testing, as I talked about, we see that stepping down towards, we'll call it, a more endemic look from 50 million tests in 2022 to 30 million tests in 2023. Now when you wrap all of that up, and of course, there's a lot of things that are still up in the air in terms of the number of spikes you might have in between 2023 really looks a lot like 2022 in terms of how we think of the base growth going forward as well as our fall through. Dan Brennan : Excellent. And then maybe as a follow up, just one more on bioproduction, if you don't mind. Certainly, the low double digit is impressive growth, particularly on the side of your business. Some of the CapEx that we've seen in the industry that is really accelerating, Rainer has talked about, I think, the margins 40% cost type of CapEx growth in '22 on top of 40% in '21. So I'm just wondering, could you give a little color or maybe the order book there like on the base business, kind of what you're seeing? And are we in like a period of like hyper investment or maybe that low double digit, could have some upside here over the next couple of years? Rainer Blair : Sure. So we do continue to talk about the low double-digit growth rate for the non-COVID bioprocessing business. That's what we've seen for many quarters. But we also talked about the fact that our backlog continues to build there. And these announcements that you're seeing here out in the market, those are important indications of the strength of the industry and the market in and of itself. And of course, you can imagine with the breadth of our portfolio our global reach that we play, if not on all on the great majority of those kind of investments. And so could there be upside? Sure, there could be. But of course, we're looking at the order book and that's in hand and thinking about how that develops, and we'll continue to update. But for now, low double digits in the non-COVID processing business, is a good planning number. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : So one of the big questions we've been getting is the Fed is looking to start raising rates. Just would be great to get your thoughts around durability demand from biopharma customers? And how much of a factor do you think higher rates could have on demand? And then finally, maybe any color on mix between development and commercial and interplay on those two sides of the market? Rainer Blair : Could you -- I'm sorry, could you repeat the second question, please? It came through a little garbled. Jack Meehan : Sure. Sorry. Just thoughts on how higher rates might influence demand from customers on the development side versus those with commercial products. Rainer Blair : Understood. Well, let's start with the rate. Well, it's early days, of course, and we'll see where those go. As we look at the markets that we play in or broadly, the impact of those rates could be different. But generally speaking, we see our end markets to be able to perform and drive growth even in a market where we see incrementally higher Fed rates. An example of that would be, if you look at biotech and aggregate, you see that the cash positions in these companies, is extraordinarily high. We continue to see investments going in there strongly. And so we don't anticipate any near-term impact due to Fed rate in that particular area. And that would, of course, overlap with the development part of your question. And as it relates to those that are already in commercial production, they are out there driving growth and ensuring the penetration of the incredibly efficacious biologic drugs, not just in the developed markets, but increasingly also in some of the higher growth markets. So we see really the demand drivers here going beyond any one country's monetary policy and continue to see that in a very positive light. So Fed policy is one thing. The specific markets that we play in, we would be less impacted by any of the incremental rate increases that are being discussed. Jack Meehan : Great. And then Dan just asked about CapEx going in on the CDMO side. I wanted to ask a similar question but focused all the CapEx going in from the bioprocessing players. Back at the Analyst Day, you talked about $1.5 billion of your own CapEx. Some of your peers are talking about a lot of more investment going in the single-use and just bioprocessing, broadly speaking. So, as you look across everything going on, just talk about supply versus demand and how you feel whether that -- just your views on that broadly speaking? Rainer Blair : Sure. Well, let me characterize that a little bit. So the large CDMO investments that you see there are really a derivative of what we talked about in your question before, which is the strength of the biotech market. These are typically smaller companies that don't want to invest their precious cash into manufacturing facilities, and we'll outsource that to CDMOs. And as we talked about, if you think about the fact that just in monoclonal antibodies over the last five years, we've seen a huge increase in the number of projects in the funnel. If you think about nucleic acid therapies, there we've seen a 10x increase in the development funnel. And now you're seeing those work their way through the clinical trial process and that requires capacity. So that's what the CDMO investments are about. And of course, the customer -- our customers are also CDMOs and we're helping them build those capacities so that they can take care of those developments going forward. And then we also continue to see drugs going commercial. And as these drugs go commercial, that's a 10 and 100x increase in production capacity requirement. And all of this then, if you aggregate that, is what's pulling on our demand and is why we are so confident in the investments that we've made. And I mentioned this not just for the short term, which, of course, is important to ensure that they're owning the supply bottlenecks as we work our way through the pandemic here, but also for the long term so that we continue to be that partner of choice that has the broadest portfolio, can integrate that portfolio horizontally and can deliver it to the point of impact around the globe with the necessary experts to help our customers get their drugs in the market more quickly and at a lower cost. Operator : We'll take the next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Hi, Rainer. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the bioprocessing piece. I know you touched a little bit about what the cadence could look like going forward. But that's certainly the question I think we get the most from investors. So I just wanted to circle back on it. I mean it sounds like you feel really good about that underlying base business growing in the low double digits. And then the vaccine piece, maybe a little bit more of a variable. But can you just talk, I guess, about the trajectory? It sounded like '22 is a decent proxy where maybe COVID comes down, and you shake out somewhere in the mid-high single digits as a whole for that kind of $7.5 billion business. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes as we go through kind of the next few years. And again, that vaccine piece comes down, but the base business seems like it's good enough to offset that and then some, but just wanted to get a better handle there. Rainer Blair : I think that's right. As we look at 2022, I mentioned the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic bioprocessing business. They'll probably be roughly flat here in 2022. Again, the assumption being that we're starting to see the pandemic going endemic on the one hand. On the other hand, what you start seeing -- you start seeing to happen is, if you will, we're going from 1.0 compounds to 2.0. So some vaccines and therapeutics are viewed as less efficacious in the current environment with the current variance, and so those become less of a factor. On the other hand, you have new monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics starting to be proposed that show much higher efficacy here with the variance that you have. And then for those that are already in market and quite effective, we're starting to see the recurring revenue as those companies are starting to recognize the recurring need for booster shots, not just here but around the globe. So we think that that's a good baseline to move forward with and how to think about it. And we've continued to view, as we've said in our long-term guide around the bioprocessing business, that that's a high single-digit grower. And I think that's the way to think about it in '22. And as we said, we think '23 will look a lot like '22 as well. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Great. No, that's helpful. And I know the order book typically you're taking orders for within a year. Is any of that building into '23 yet? Or should we think about that as mostly a 12-month order book and then maybe conversations beyond that? Rainer Blair : It's a 12-month order book in conversations beyond that. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And last one, just the same topic for Matt. Margin profile, COVID versus not for the bioprocessing, it's pretty similar, right? I just want to double check on that. Matt McGrew : Yes. In bioprocessing, margin difference between COVID and not, is that what you're asking? Patrick Donnelly : Yes, exactly. Matt McGrew : Yes. No. No real difference. I mean we're -- I would say that it's all, again, just depending on mix of what goes in there, product-wise, but no margin profile wise it's the same.. Operator : And this will conclude today's Q&A portion for the call. I'll turn the call back over to Matt Gugino with any additional remarks. Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Ashley, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We're around all day for questions. Rainer Blair : Thank you everybody. Operator : And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well, thank you, John and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We are off to a good start in 2022 with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectations. The team navigated a challenging operating environment to deliver strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. And our performance was broad-based with high single-digit or better core revenue growth in each of our three segments. Now during the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through high-impact growth investments in innovation and bio-processing production capacity, both of which we believe are contributing to market share gains. Now, clearly, our well-rounded results are really a testament to our team\u2019s commitment to continuous improvement and to the unique positioning of our portfolio. We just have an exceptional collection of businesses, all powered by the Danaher Business System that serve attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers and it\u2019s this combination that differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for the future. So with that, let\u2019s turn to our first quarter results. Sales were $7.7 billion in the first quarter and we delivered 12% of core revenue growth. Our base business was up 8% and with broad-based strength across the portfolio and COVID-19 testing contributing 4%. Geographically, revenue in both the U.S. and Western Europe grew mid-teens, while high-growth markets were up low single-digits. China declined low single-digits, but was up high single-digits, excluding the impact of a previously called out significant bioprocessing project delivered in the prior year. The COVID-19 driven lockdowns that began in late March had a very modest impact on our first quarter results in China. However, as these lockdowns extend further into April, we are seeing more of an impact in our businesses. And we anticipate the situation will begin to ease in the coming weeks with an eventual return to normalized activity levels by the end of June. Our gross profit margin for the first quarter was 61.2%. The operating margin decline of 80 basis points to 28.3% is largely due to year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates and product mix, primarily within our Life Sciences segment. Now, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 9.5% versus last year and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. So, now let\u2019s take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we are seeing in our end markets today. Let\u2019s start with Life Sciences where reported revenue grew 9.5% and core revenue was up 7.5% with broad-based strength across the segment. In bioprocessing, we are seeing very robust activity levels. Customers are accelerating their investments in research and production across all major therapeutic modalities. Core revenue in our bioprocessing business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech grew high single-digits and was up low double-digits, excluding the impact of that significant one-time project in China last year. The orders remain very healthy and we continued to build backlog across both businesses during the quarter. Now over the last 2 years, our customers prioritized the development of COVID-19 vaccine and therapies to rapidly accelerate their time to market. Today, these programs require less investment in manufacturing capacity as they mature and become a part of our customers\u2019 core business. And as a result, our customers are starting to reallocate resources back to previously paused and new programs for other modalities, notably monoclonal antibody-based therapies or MAB cell and gene therapies and mRNA-based technologies. In bioprocessing today, monoclonal antibodies are the largest investment area for our customers as they are becoming the standard of care in the treatment of many diseases. Customers are adding manufacturing capacity to support both novel MABT in clinical trials and the rapid growth of approved treatment. Biosimilar development and production are also increasing as patents on higher volume therapies expire. This trend is making life-saving treatments more accessible and helping to accelerate adoption in underserved markets. Now, we continue to make substantial investments in manufacturing capacity to help meet our customers accelerating demand in bioprocessing. An important focus area of our expansion has been with single-use technology which are key enablers to scale the development and manufacturing of biologic and genomic-based medicines. In this first quarter, our newest plan dedicated to the manufacturing of single-use technology came online in Cardiff, Wales. Now, this plant, along with recently opened facilities in South Carolina and Beijing are critical to support our customers\u2019 demand today. Long-term, they provide additional capacity for one of the fastest growing product categories within bioprocessing. So turning to our Life Sciences Instrument businesses, we are seeing strong levels of activity in all major end markets. Demand is particularly robust at our pharmaceutical CRO and academic research customers where a healthy funding environment is accelerating the initiation of new projects. In the first quarter, Leica Microsystems, IDT and SCIEX each grew over 10%. At SCIEX, the ZenoTOF 7600 and Triple Quad 7500 continue to perform well and are great examples of how our investments in innovation are driving market share gains and enhancing our growth trajectory. At Leica Microsystems, Mica is another example of impactful innovation for our customers. Mica integrates wide field and confocal imaging in a single instrument while leveraging machine learning and automation to dramatically simplify the imaging workflow for our researchers. So clearly, across the life sciences portfolio, we are investing in innovation to bring meaningful solutions to our customers and to strengthen our competitive position. Aldevron continued its great start as a part of Danaher, delivering over 40% growth in the first quarter. Since joining Danaher in late August, the team has embraced the Danaher Business System and is putting DBS tools to work. Recently completed Kaizen event which focused on increasing throughput further reducing lead times are already generating terrific results. So we are excited about the early progress at Aldevron and thrilled with the great work the team is doing. So now let\u2019s move to Diagnostics, where reported revenue was up 21.5% and core revenue grew 22.5% led by over 50% growth at Cepheid. Our non-COVID clinical diagnostics businesses collectively grew mid single-digits. Notably, Leica Biosystems delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by strength in core histology, advanced staining and digital pathology. The clinical diagnostic market volumes remain at healthy levels in most geographies as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screenings and other elective procedures. Our customers are effectively managing through periodic outbreaks by adapting their protocols and procedures allowing them to continue providing critical healthcare services. Now in China, we are currently seeing regional lockdowns impact patient volumes and we expect our Diagnostics business to be the most effective in the second quarter. In Molecular Diagnostics, respiratory testing volumes have moderated globally as the Omicron outbreak has subsided in most regions. However, demand for Cepheid testing at the point of care remains very strong and we believe we are taking market share. Our continued growth and share gains are a testament to the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab results and a best-in-class workflow is providing to clinicians at the point of care. So, as COVID-19 moves towards an endemic disease state, we are seeing increased demand for Cepheid\u2019s broader test menu. In the first quarter, non-respiratory testing revenue grew double-digits, led by hospital-acquired infection, urology and infectious disease testing. Customers, including several who initially purchased our GeneXpert system for COVID-19 testing, are expressing increased interest in expanding their menu utilization. As our customers free capacity from respiratory testing, we believe there are significant opportunities to leverage our market leading installed base and testing menu to drive broader utilization and demand for Cepheid\u2019s point-of-care molecular testing solutions. Now, respiratory testing revenue of $900 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations as customers showed an increased preference for Cepheid\u2019s 4-in-1 combination test during the respiratory season. Our combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 65% of the 17 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter with COVID-only tests accounting for approximately 35%. So now, let\u2019s move to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, where reported revenue grew 2.5% with core revenue up 6.5%, including [Technical Difficulty] water quality and mid single-digit growth at product identification. At water quality, ChemTreat delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, accelerating demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end market. The equipment order rate also remained strong as customers are continuing to invest in larger municipal projects. Now Product Identification, our marking and coding business was up high single-digits partially offset by slight decline in our packaging and color management business. Videojet was up high single-digits with strong demand in food, beverage and industrial end markets. So stepping back, our water quality and product identification platforms have done an exceptional job of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve their positioning both from a cost and growth perspective. While supply chain pressures have been modestly more pronounced than EAS, our teams are using DBS tools such as daily management to work with suppliers and ensure production component availability. We are also using visual project management to help us reengineer our products faster with a focus on moving from difficult to source electronic component to newer, more cost-effective next-generation chipsets. Now, we believe DBS enables us to deliver faster and more reliably than many of our competitors. Now, our teams are also using DBS growth tools to accelerate innovation and deliver more impactful solutions to the market, innovations such as Videojet, CIJ 1880 printer and HACH\u2019s HQ series portable meters, are helping our customers solve the many challenges they face from increasing regulatory requirements to skilled labor shortages. And we are seeing the impact in our core growth, which has averaged mid single-digits annually over the past 10 years at EAS. So we believe this combination of the rigorous application of DBS tools, paired with our proactive growth investment is driving meaningful market share gains and enhancing our long-term competitive advantage. So now, let\u2019s briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver mid single-digit core revenue growth in our base business, which includes a headwind of approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the ongoing COVID-19 related shutdowns in China. For the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business as we expect the shutdowns in China to normalize as we move through the remainder of the year. We continue to expect both a low single-digit core growth headwind from COVID-19 testing and overall mid-single-digit core revenue growth. So to wrap up, we had a good start to the year and look forward to building on this foundation as we move through 2022. Our first quarter results are a testament to the dedication of our outstanding team and their commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System. And these results also reflect the unique positioning of our portfolio and the exceptional collection of high-quality franchises that comprise Danaher today. We believe the durability of our businesses where consumables now represent 75% of revenue, positions us exceptionally well in today\u2019s dynamic operating environment. So this powerful combination of our talented team, the strength of our portfolio and the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term competitive advantage. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you, John. John Bedford : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Leo, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Rainer Blair : Hi, Derik. Good morning. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I got just a couple of sort of like incoming from clients. I think, first of all, just a little bit more on the difference between \u2013 I think you mentioned 19 million on the Cepheid guide, and it came in at 17. Just a little bit more color on the volume difference there? And I think also a related question, just are you seeing any sort of stockpiling in terms of either vendors for either bioprocessing or on the diagnostics side? And I\u2019ve got more follow-up. Rainer Blair : 4-in- 1 test : Derik De Bruin : Great. And just can you on the China headwind in the quarter, that 20 to 30 basis points, what\u2019s supply versus demand? Rainer Blair : Well, this is entirely related to supply accessibility of customers. So the demand in China continues to be very robust. As you may have noted, without the \u2013 in the first quarter without this large project in the prior year, China was up high single digits for us, orders very strong. So this is really related to customer accessibility in hospitals, in labs and of course, the one or the other manufacturing plant that\u2019s affected by these shutdowns. Now as we sit here today, we\u2019re already receiving the news from our team that we\u2019re able to open up not just our plant, and so those are starting to open up here as well slowly but surely, as well as we would expect throughout the quarter client \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, as well as lab accessibility to improve already in May and then get back to more normal levels here by the end of the quarter. Derik De Bruin : Great. And if I can sneak one more in, the 2Q hit, nice to see you reiterating the full year guide with that. Is that expected as you expect all that China business to come back? Or do you think you\u2019ll see stronger growth in other regions offsetting it? Thank you. I am done. Rainer Blair : This is mostly about China getting back to normal activity levels and both customers as well as our plants having the makeup capacity to make up for what we think are relatively short shutdown period. Having said that, the business is a large one, and there is always pockets that will grow faster. So between the two things, we feel confident that our guide for the full year holds. Operator : We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Good morning, Rainer. Congrats on a solid Q1 print. Maybe one on the vaccine side. Rainer, I know it\u2019s part of the base. But I guess yesterday, J&J did pull out their vaccine guidance. They are not guiding to vaccine. Not news anymore. Obviously, there is been a lot of questions on the vaccine side and base bioprocessing. So maybe just talk about the bioprocessing trends in the queue. What were order trends were orders above revenues? And are you still confident about the 2 billion of vaccine outlook for fiscal \u201822? Rainer Blair : Well, thanks, Vijay. So let\u2019s just level set on the numbers briefly here. If we think about bioprocessing Q1, and as I mentioned during my opening commentary, we extract that very large Q1 shipment last year in China, our bioprocessing business was up low double digits here in Q1. Very, very strong order activity, and I\u2019ll come back to that in a minute. Now if you look at our first quarter last year, our sales were up over 70%. And so if you look at the 2-year stack for Q1, we\u2019re in the 35% to 40% growth area, which we think is very robust and more than representative of what is going on in the market and think that, that compares extremely well. In fact, we still think that we\u2019re taking share there. So that\u2019s sort of one marker that I want you to have. And then the second point is the order activity continues to be very, very strong. Last year, our orders in the first quarter were up over 90%. And so we anticipated that our orders in Q1 of this year would be down but nonetheless, we continue to build backlog here in Q1 as well in the bioprocessing area. And this is why we\u2019re so confident in our core growth guide here for the year and bioprocessing of high single digit, low double digits between the robust growth that we\u2019re seeing and the backlog that we have, that\u2019s really important. So now let\u2019s unpack that a little bit and think about what\u2019s going on and why COVID is sort of one variable, but that there are other variables here that are incredibly important and explain why we talk about the bioprocessing business and its growth in aggregate. So first of all, as you think about the activity levels outside of COVID in the bioprocessing business, it\u2019s important to see what\u2019s going on in clinical trials. And I\u2019ve talked about this, but you know that the project pipeline for monoclonal antibodies is 50% larger today than it was 5 years ago. For cell and gene therapy, it\u2019s 10x larger, driving extraordinary activity here in the clinical trial area. And what you see, and as I mentioned in the opening comments, you see customers really starting to focus on these new projects across all modalities and not just allocating the resources to COVID, but to these new modalities. So that\u2019s really important to note that customer activity level continues to be very, very high, and that plays through in the clinical trials. Now another point to take here is monoclonal antibodies are becoming the standard of care and the predominant class of biologic drugs. So what\u2019s going on in monoclonal antibodies is the primary growth driver in the market and also for our business and recently launched products that are ramping to new treatment and new indications are driving an exceptional amount of volume here. And then you add to that, that emerging markets and high-growth markets, such as China and India, are starting to have access to these monoclonal antibody treatments that provides additional and significant volume leverage. At the same time, you have biosimilar growth, Vijay. So these biosimilars are leveraging the fact that some of the biologic drugs, monoclonal antibody that are higher volume are starting to come off patent, and that\u2019s increasing the penetration of those drugs throughout the world where the penetration has been lower. And that\u2019s providing another growth impetus. And then lastly, I\u2019ll start with this now. We\u2019ve been talking about single-use technology and their adoption for a while, which is an additional leverage growth vector within the bioprocessing business. So all that helped the activity that we talked about provides for volume, but SUT on top of that is substituting more traditional technologies and is growing even faster. And we have well over $1 billion of single-use technology. And we\u2019ve just announced that our third new plant coming on for single-use technologies in Cardiff, Wales. So we feel very confident on the basis of what\u2019s going on outside of COVID. And that\u2019s why we look at it together because it\u2019s the aggregate that we look at and that really ultimately count that, that will drive that high single-digit, low double-digit growth here for 2022 and also supports our high single-digit perspective beyond that. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful, Rainer. And maybe one quick one for Matt McGrew, I think incremental margins we were looking at perhaps mid-30s. Q1 came in below. Matt, was this was this supply chain inflation impact in Q1 or perhaps FX or maybe just talk about incrementals and have expectations assuming for fiscal \u201822. Matt McGrew : Yes. No, for Q1, I mean, we kind of came through about 25%. I think that was pretty much in line with what we thought, Vijay. So no real difference, I think \u2013 from a year-over-year perspective, the difference between that $35 million to $40 million that we normally talk to in this 25, it was all FX, right? So in the quarter, I mean you think about it, it was kind of like a $0.07 headwind here for us. So I don\u2019t think we saw anything. Obviously, supply chain is what it is, but I think we were able to kind of work our way through that. I really think it was all FX here \u2013 excuse me. In the quarter and first quarter. As far as \u2013 I think you bring up a good point then as far as the full year goes, so I would say there is no change to the full year fall through other than the FX impact that we\u2019re seeing. And just to kind of lay that out. We continue to expect mid-single-digit core growth from kind of the core and acquisitions, and that will have that 35% to 40% fall through. In January, we thought that FX was going to bring that 35% to 40% down to, say, 30% to 35%. But given the currency moves we\u2019ve seen since January, as we sit here today, I think it\u2019s going to be more like 20%, 25% fall-through for the year versus the 30 to 35 that we sort of guided to the last time. So look, it still leaves us, if we deliver that, that still leaves low single-digit EPS growth for the year despite what I think is some pretty significant FX headwinds year-over-year. And maybe just to give you a color on the sizing of that headwind, I mean right now, FX is going to be a $0.35 EPS headwind year-over-year, and that\u2019s a pretty meaningful number for us here during the year. It\u2019s probably half of what we initially thought. So it\u2019s a pretty big headwind here for the year, and it was a little bit here in the quarter, too. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful, Matt. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Rainer Blair : Scott, good morning. Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the detail here. The price dynamic, I mean, I know it\u2019s FX is FX. I can\u2019t do much about that perhaps. But \u2013 do you \u2013 are you still out there capturing additional price to offset the general inflation and general cost and logistics issues that are so prevalent? Rainer Blair : Scott, we have been working price directly and indirectly, and we\u2019re seeing very good traction. Let me lay that out for you here. And let me start off with the fact that there are inflationary pressures out there. We\u2019ve talked about that in the past. And that moves from sort of the classic topics of memory chips and other types of chipsets and freight and perhaps labor to seeing more broadly inflation. But nonetheless, with the Danaher Business System, our teams have been able to do a number of things here in order to contain this. One, of course, is related to ensuring the robustness of the supply. Many of our businesses today are gaining share because we are able to continue our supply, have shorter lead times because we\u2019re able to access and secure the components necessary to drive our manufacturing in our business. So it\u2019s an important aspect to this entire equation of growth and share gain. Secondly, the DBS toolset that we have been putting in place are also helping us offset costs in the sense, and as I mentioned in the introductory comments that, look, we are able to now reengineer more quickly to other types of \u2013 again, I\u2019ll use the example of chipsets to next-gen chip set more broadly consolidate those and not only gain supply, but then also reduce our costs. So there is an entire DBS machine, if you will, that is driving to secure supply and to offset costs. At the same time, of course, we are driving price, and we see strong traction there. In fact, we are well over 200 basis points of price here in the first quarter, and that\u2019s a quarter that still had a fair amount of, if you will, 2021 backlog in it, right. So, we have now worked through the majority of that backlog and expect to see continued momentum there. So, thinking about price at these levels of 200-plus basis points, that\u2019s the right way to think about that. And it\u2019s just another testament to the strength of our portfolio, the degree of differentiation of our product and the leverage that this razor/blade business model provides us with 75% consumables, many of which are specked in or keyed into the equipment or instruments that they supply. Operator : We will move next to Dan Brennan of Cowen. Rainer Blair : Hi Dan. Good morning. Dan Brennan : Good morning Rainer. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter. So, if I could just go back to bioprocess, obviously, a really nice quarter with a high-single digit growth against so extremely tough comp. I appreciate COVID is part of the base, and it\u2019s great about all the robust demand, obviously, ex-COVID, which is a big driver long-term. But given the interest in kind of dissecting COVID at this point from investors, it would be helpful to learn if the 2022 high single, low-double digit guide continues to incorporate $2 billion from COVID. And if it does, any color you can provide there about like how much of that $2 billion is blocked in with firm orders? Rainer Blair : Thanks Dan. Really, the way we are thinking about that business is, again, in aggregate, and we do believe that both the underlying strength of the markets as I just laid out, as well as the strength of our backlog, which continues to grow, support both the high-single digit, low-double digit bioprocessing guide for the year. And as you think about COVID within that, COVID is going to do what it does, but there is a larger market that is growing rapidly and we are going to continue to see fluctuation as it relates to COVID volumes, whether there is a decision on booster for different age groups, whether it becomes part of an annualized immunization regimen. All of these are open questions. And our belief is that COVID is a part of our business, but there is another part of this business, which is larger, it is growing at a faster rate and we are making investments to ensure that we capture the appropriate shares here. So Dan, high-single digits, low-double digits bioprocessing growth for 2022. Dan Brennan : Thanks Rainer. So, I will get on a really strong quarter out of the gate. Maybe can you give us a little color on how the integration is going \u2013 and in light of the really strong first quarter, how do we think about Aldevron for the full year in 2022 and beyond? Rainer Blair : I mean we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the team. I have been up there several times working with the team, seeing how they are growing, bringing on capacity. We continue to invest in expansions there. And that 40% growth exceeded our expectations and gives you a sense of how quickly the Danaher Business System has gained traction. And that\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. The first thing is the leadership and the team at Aldevron that is pulling and open to applying the Danaher Business System as fast as possible to fortify their competitive advantage in lead times, in quality and to ensure that we drive this business to the growth of its potential. And we think for 2022, we continue to think that the $500 million revenue number is a good number, 40% in Q1. We certainly expect to be in the first half year, well over our expectation of 20% plus that we previously talked about. So, $500 million for the year is a good number, and that team is firing on all cylinders. Dan Brennan : And if I could squeeze one more in. Just on China. Obviously, good news that you guys are managing through this and the full year guide is maintained. Maybe if you could just give us an update like in Q2, like what you are actually expecting for China? Maybe you said the number, I missed it. And kind of how do you think about China for the full year since you are expecting a nice rebound beginning Q2? Thank you. Rainer Blair : Sure. So, just to revisit, we have talked about China here. In the first quarter, it was really the end of March when we started to see the impact of some of these larger scale shutdowns, and we continue to see those here in the first week of April, although we have just spoken to the team here yesterday and they received approval to start opening up plants and we also see more activity at our customers. And so we do expect to work through the shutdowns here in the second quarter. Again, that was the 200 basis points to 300 basis point headwind that we included in our Q2 guide of mid-single digits. So, as we think about the quarter here and for China, remember, we had a very strong activity level in Q1, high-single digit growth minus that large transaction last year. And we expect that in China will probably be down in Q2, mid to high-single digit percentages for the quarter. Now once again, we expect that to unwind in Q2 and then continue to catch back up here through the year where we continue to see China as a high-single digit market. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Rainer Blair : Good morning Jack. How are you? Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good. Good morning. So on Life Sciences, I wanted to turn to some of the capital heavy businesses, SCIEX, Leica Micro, Pall Industrial. Can you just talk about the durability of the growth you are seeing there? How are order trends \u2013 and any change to the growth expectations for the year? Rainer Blair : So, in Life Sciences, if we now pivot from bioprocessing and more to the life science analytical businesses, as you suggest, Jack, we are seeing very strong underlying activity in the various sectors of the business. If you think about the Pharmaceutical segment, CROs, academic research customers, our funnels are strong and continue to outpace quarter-over-quarter what we have seen in 2021. I think that buttressed for us, particularly because of the strong innovation track record and the recent launches that we have had. I have talked to those at SCIEX, the ZenoTOF, the accurate mAb instrument as well as the 7500 Triple Quad, those are class-leading innovations that are growing exceptionally well and driving market share gains. Beckman Life Sciences, with their CytoFLEX Benchtop sales order the most recent launch. And then of course, we talked about Mica, which is that combination of wide field and confocal leveraging machine learning. So, we are firing on all cylinders here in a strong investment environment. And we think that, that\u2019s sustainable here for the foreseeable future as we continue to see investments from both the biotech sector, but also academic sectors, as well as institutions that are very, very bullish on the innovation and the science that they want to drive forward. Jack Meehan : Great. And then just a broader question on M&A. It\u2019s been obviously a very choppy macro environment. You look at the cash flow statement, it was a light quarter for you on M&A. Just curious how you are seeing assets in the market, do you feel like expectations have changed at all from sellers and just your own willingness to do M&A kind of in a choppy environment? Thanks. Rainer Blair : Well, Jack, I will tell you, we have excelled in these kind of environments historically from an M&A perspective. These environments of dislocation inevitably show opportunity and we feel very good about how we are positioned with our funnel. Now having said that, the volatility that we are seeing today is while it might not feel that way relatively recent and it\u2019s probably a little too early to see the full impact of that volatility. Having said that, we are sitting here with 2x a turn, very strong free cash flow of over $7 billion and over $10 billion of EBITDA. So, we feel like we are in a very good position both in terms of the strength of our balance sheet as well as the opportunities that lie ahead. Operator : We will take our next question from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Rainer Blair : Good morning Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Good morning Rainer. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe you want to kind of jump from away from China on the geographic side. Over in Europe, obviously, a lot going on there on the geopolitical side. Can you just talk about if you have seen any change in customer behavior? Any change in funding over there, what your guys\u2019 perspective is on that region as we work through this? Rainer Blair : So, Western Europe has continued to perform very well for us. As I mentioned in our opening comments here, we had strong growth in the mid-teens in Western Europe here in the first quarter. And while we think that moderates a little bit here in Q2 just because of some of the prior year performance is, the activity levels remain very strong. Certainly, in Western Europe, that is the case. And as you think about your reference to the geopolitical side, Eastern Europe just has not been that large of a factor in the life science research and bioprocessing area as an example. And from a diagnostics perspective, we continue to see a very high, let\u2019s say, close to normal activity levels as well. So, Western Europe for us continues to perform as expected. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe on the diagnostics business, just looking at the core performance there ex-COVID, looks pretty strong. Can you just talk about that? And then maybe Matt can talk about the diagnostics margins also really strong, just the sustainability there. Rainer Blair : As we think about the business momentum really in all regions, with the exception of China, which I talked about, we are seeing patient levels, activity levels really at or very close to pre-pandemic levels. And so from a macro perspective and patient volume, it\u2019s a positive environment for us. And then if you put on the back of that, the recent product launches that we have had, the DxH900 hematology as well as the DxA Fit and automation for small and medium-sized labs, we are also continuing to benefit from that NPI pace that we have invested in here over the past year. So for us, diagnostics continues to be a strong forward momentum. Matt, do you want to take this? Matt McGrew : Yes. I mean on the margin front, I mean I think you think about that that is going to be a big part of that will be Cepheid and the volume that we are seeing there. So, as long as we have got that volume and we expect to have a touch less here into next quarter. But I think those margins are pretty sustainable at that level. We have talked about and importantly, I think the margin profile of the Cepheid respiratory is no different than the margin profile of other Cepheid tests, right. It\u2019s actually very similar to the flu. So, I think it\u2019s a sustainable number here as we look forward. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks guys. Operator : We will take our final question from Luke Sergott of Barclays. Rainer Blair : Good morning Luke. Luke Sergott : Good morning. Thanks again for the question here. So, I guess I just wanted to kind of dig in on the long-term growth target, the biopharma high-single digits and really trying to figure out where the offsets are coming from? You talked about the mAbs. I know you are adding new capacity, but as COVID kind of is completely up in the air, and that rolls off, give us a sense of how much that could roll off and you guys continue to maintain that long-term growth target? Rainer Blair : Happy to. So Luke, the way we are thinking about that is \u2013 the strength of our underlying business, which I laid out here in some details, some clinical trials, mAbs, biosimilar volumes, keep in mind, it\u2019s the commercialized drugs that really drive volume here in this business. And then of course that additional growth accelerator of the single-use technology adoption. Those are really the foundations that are driving the growth of this business. And the COVID business, it will do what it does, but that variation is within the realm of what we have been casting as the overall growth rate of the business. And so you take the backlog, which continues to grow quarter-over-quarter and you take the growth drivers that I have laid out. That is what supports the high-single digit, low-double digit growth for 2022 and the high-single digit longer term growth guide that we have talked about. Luke Sergott : Great. Thanks. It\u2019s helpful. And on \u2013 so back to Aldevron here, I know they are continuing to add capacity. Is that still \u2013 is that coming in faster than you guys expected, or should we still expect that to pace out through \u201823 and \u201824? Rainer Blair : That\u2019s going to continue to pace out as we add line after line after line. But I would say that these are programs that are coming on, on or better than schedule as the team continues to gain speed here not only with their subject matter expertise, which is differentiated. So, unique in the marketplace, but also with their adoption of the Danaher Business System. So, we look for that $500 million here in 2022. Luke Sergott : Okay. Great. That\u2019s it all for me. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would be happy to return the call to our host for any concluding remarks. John Bedford : Thanks, everyone. We will be around the rest of the week for questions. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone, have a great day.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well thank you, John. And good morning to all of you. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today.  So let me start with, we had a great quarter. In fact, our strong second quarter results rounded out a terrific first half of the year. Broad-based strength across the portfolio drove better than expected revenue, earnings and cash flow. And we were particularly pleased with the performance of our base business, which through high single digits and believe we gain market share in many of our businesses. Now these results are a testament to our team's strong commitment to executing in a challenging operating environment. They have done an incredible job, leveraging the Danaher business system to help mitigate supply chain constraints, manage inflationary pressures, and improve our competitive positioning with impactful new innovation. Our second quarter results also highlights the strength and resilience of the businesses that make up Danaher today. Our portfolio is comprised of leading franchises positioned in attractive end markets with strong, secular growth drivers, all united by a common set of durable business models. In fact, nearly 75% of our revenues today are recurring, the majority of which are consumables that are specified into highly regulated manufacturing processes or specific to the equipment that we supply. On top of that, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. We believe this powerful combination of our talented team and the strength of our portfolio, all powered by the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term, competitive advantage. So with that, let's turn to our second quarter results in a little more detail. Sales were $7.8 billion and we delivered 9.5% core revenue growth, including 8% growth in our base business with strong contributions from all four of our operating platforms. COVID-19 testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter. Geographically, core revenue in developed markets grew low double digits with broad based strengths across North America and Western Europe. High growth markets were up mid-single digits, including impressive high single digit growth in China. Our results in China significantly exceeded our expectations, which is particularly notable as lockdowns continued for longer than we anticipated. So now I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our associates in China for their extraordinary efforts and commitment during such a challenging time, to the teams that managed the approvals necessary to reopen our facilities, the supply chain and logistics teams that kept parts moving and the manufacturing associates who spent several weeks away from their families, thank you. Thank you for supporting the reopening effort. And most importantly, thank you for supporting our customers. This is such a great example of one of our core values. The best team wins in action. Now, as we move through the rest of the year, we're keeping an eye out for further outbreaks and regional lockdowns, but we're currently seeing more normalized business operations in China and expect this positive trend to continue for the balance of the year. Gross profit margin for the second quarter was 60.9%. And our operating margin of 28.4% was up 60 basis points, including 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion. Our strong margin performance was a result of disciplined cost management and the proactive measures our teams have taken to address the inflationary pressures we've seen over the last several quarters. We're also using DBS tools to execute price actions, and we achieved approximately 400 basis points of price increases in the quarter, a significant acceleration from our historical price realization. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 12% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.4 billion year-to-date. Now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. In our Life Sciences segment reported revenue grew 6% and core revenue was up 7%. Strength was broad based across the segment with high single digit or better base business core revenue growth at each of our largest operating companies. In our bioprocessing business, we continue to see record activity levels from early-stage research to later stage development and production, which drove a combined core revenue growth rate of high single digits at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Our backlog and our order levels remain very healthy. And as always, we're working closely with customers to ensure they have the right inventory levels to support their planned activity. We are seeing our customers continue the healthy transition away from COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, and into previously paused and new programs for other modalities. As a result, we now expect COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenue of approximately $1 billion in 2022 down from approximately $2 billion in 2021. Now that said, there is no change to our high-single to low-double digit core revenue growth outlook in our bioprocessing business for the year as customers are accelerating their investments across all other major therapeutic modalities. This acceleration, paired with improving price realization, is driving more than 20% core growth in our non-COVID business, up from the low-double digit growth we've seen historically. The biologics market remains very healthy as evidenced by the increasing number of treatments and development and production. Today, there are over 1,500 monoclonal antibody based-therapies in development globally, which is up more than 50% from just five years ago. This is being driven by both novel molecules and development and the proliferation of biosimilars, which are helping to accelerate adoption and underserved markets as patents on higher volume therapies expire. There are also over 2,000 cell and gene therapy candidates in development today, a more than tenfold increase over the last several years. Now, given this backdrop of such a significant and sustained increase in activity, we expect the growth rate in this market to remain very strong for many years to come. Now as the complexity required to manufacture these life saving treatments increases, customers are looking to collaborate with us to help them solve their most challenging problems and assist them as they move from lab to production scale. Cytiva recently announced a collaboration with Bayer to develop the industry's first modular end-to-end manufacturing platform for allogeneic cell therapy, which will help to improve the treatment of a broad array of diseases, including cancer. This collaboration is just another great example of how our scientific expertise and leading positions in upstream and downstream applications are helping these cutting edge therapies advance from the laboratory to the clinic. Our more instrument oriented life science businesses collectively delivered high-single-digit base business core revenue growth. We're seeing a healthy funding environment and solid demand across most major end markets. SCIEX core revenue was up more than 10% in the second quarter driven by an acceleration of new projects at our biopharma, CRO and academic research customers. We continued our cadence of innovation with the introduction of several new solutions that improve the accuracy and efficiency of genomics and proteomics research. Notably SCIEX introduced the Zeno SWATH DIA, an innovative software solution, which doubles the number of proteins that can be discovered versus previous swath approaches. Helping researchers discover more potential biomarkers and better understand the cause and treatment of diseases. Now in our genomic businesses, customers are making significant investments in the development and production of cell and gene therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines, and gene editing. IDT had its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit core revenue growth led by robust activity and NextGen sequencing and gene writing and editing. Aldevron grew more than 20% while also making significant progress on the capacity expansion projects needed to support their long-term growth outlook. Now moving to our diagnostic segment, reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 12.5% led by nearly 30% growth at SCIEX. Our other diagnostic businesses including Beckman Coulter diagnostics, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth despite headwinds from the COVID-19 related shutdowns in China. In China, our diagnostics core revenue was flat year-over-year. Site access and patient volumes slowly improved as the quarter progressed with a more pronounced recovery in June. Patient volumes remain slightly below normal levels, but we expect continued recovery as we progress through the remainder of the year. Now outside of China, patient volumes across hospital and reference labs held up well during the quarter and remain at or above pre-pandemic levels despite recent outbreaks of emerging COVID variants. Our diagnostics customers continue to face skilled labor shortages and are increasingly seeking to improve automation and productivity within their labs. This quarter Leica Biosystems introduced its next-generation fully automated advanced staining platform bond prime to help address these needs in the pathology lab. Bond prime facilitates a continuous pathology lab workflow and delivers the high resolution stains needed for a definitive diagnosis with an industry leading average turnaround time of only 90 minutes. Now, as I mentioned earlier, core revenue growth at Cepheid was up nearly 30% in the quarter. Low-teens growth across our non-respiratory test menu was led by sexual health, hospital acquired infections and virology. In respiratory testing, strong global demand persisted for Cepheid's point-of-care assays and we believe we continued to gain market share. Respiratory testing revenue of approximately $750 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations of approximately $400 million. The spread of highly transmissible COVID variants and greater incidents of other respiratory infections such as RSV and flu led to both higher testing volume and a preference for our 4-in-1 combination tests. As a result, our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19 Flu-A, Flu-B and RSV represented about 50% of the 16 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter with COVID only tests accounting for the remaining 50%. Now as COVID-19 shifts to an endemic disease state, we're seeing more customers begin to consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platform onto the Cepheid GeneXpert. This preference for the GeneXpert both within hospitals and across healthcare networks is evidence of the significant value, the unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and an easy-to-use best-in-class workflow provide clinicians. In addition, as our customers begin freeing capacity from respiratory testing, they are increasingly interested in discussing opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading point-of-care molecular testing menu. Now moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 6.5% and core revenue was up 10% with double-digit core growth at water quality and mid-single-digit core revenue growth at product identification. In water quality ChemTreat, Trojan and Hach each group double-digits during the second quarter. Robust growth in our analytical chemistries and consumables was broad-based across all major end markets. Equipment sales remained strong with healthy levels of project activity at both industrial and municipal customers. At product identification, marking and coding was up high-single-digit and packaging and color management grew mid-single-digit. Videojet was up high-single-digit led by North America where food and beverage sales were particularly strong. Our EAS team are leading the charge and writing the newest chapter in the DBS playbook to counter the supply chain and inflationary pressures we're seeing every day. They've been reengineering products to reduce our reliance on hard-to-source electronic components and using daily management to work closely with suppliers to ensure production part availability. These efforts along with our accelerated price actions are also helping improve our margin physician. We saw the impact on our results this quarter with more than 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion at EAS. Our strong performance also highlights the resiliency and the durability of the high margin recurring revenue business models that make up our EAS portfolio. With that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year. In a third quarter, we expect to deliver high-single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a mid-single-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing resulting in low-single-digit core revenue growth overall. For the full year 2022 there is no change to our previous guidance of high-single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and mid-single-digit core revenue growth overall. Given our strong second quarter performance, we now expect operating fall through at the high end of our previously communicated range of 20% to 25% for the full year. So to wrap up, we're really pleased with our strong second quarter and first half performance. Our results are a testament to the team's consistent execution in a dynamic operating environment, and to the durable balanced position of our portfolio today. Looking ahead, our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System, our differentiated portfolio of businesses serving attractive end markets and our strong balance sheet all positioned Danaher to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance. So with that I'll turn the call back over to John. John Bedford : Thanks Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Gretchen, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Derik. Mike Ryskin : Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Rainer Blair : Hi Mike. Mike Ryskin : Hi. Couple of quick questions; one on the COVID versus non-COVID bioprocess you talked about, really appreciate the clarity on the reduction in COVID but then fully offsetting that with non-COVID strength. I want to ask on the non-COVID bioprocessing, your higher expectations for that. How durable do you think that is in the future years? Is that growth rate in those business sustainable for 2023 and beyond? Or are we seeing a little bit of a catch-up in 2022? Just due to some of those projects being put on hold the last couple of years? Rainer Blair : Thanks Mike. Look, I mean, I think the way we see it is the only way. What level set on 2022 here where in the COVID business we see revenues going from 2021, $2 billion to 2022, $1 billion? The non-COVID business as you suggested has accelerated here as customers are moving to non-COVID modalities and all sorts of them very broad based and of course on the margin price-ends up helping that as well. So we would expect certainly for 2023 to continue to see elevated levels of non-COVID activity probably above the low-double-digits that we have seen historically too early to say if it stays up over 20%, but certainly elevated in 2023 versus what it's been historically. Mike Ryskin : Great. Are you seeing any, any stocking or any change in purchasing patterns by any of your customers in particular CDMOs? And that's related to the by bioprocess, but then just overall anywhere across your portfolio? Rainer Blair : So we have very, very close relationships as a result of what we've just all passed through here in the last 18 months. With all of our customers we conduct regular surveys and while there is the one or the other customer that has canceled the large project, which by the way is not that unusual right in this business project sometimes fail even in late stage clinical trials, I would say generally speaking, we see healthy inventories across the sector and don't see any major pockets of build-up. Mike Ryskin : Okay. Thanks. And then one last one if I could squeeze it in. The feeling better about the operating margin fall through for the rest of the year, just to clarify, is that the effect of the beat in 2Q? Or is there anything else going into that in terms of pricing, supply chain, COVID contribution sort of like what's changed there? Rainer Blair : Yes. I mean, I think certainly Q2 is helpful, right? I mean, if you think about sort of where we ended up in the feed that gave us a lot of latitude to offset some of the FX headwinds, but I think if you think about what we're seeing in the businesses pricing is holding in very well kind of couple hundred basis points better than we did here in Q1. You look at the supply chain; I think we've done a really good job of managing that plus driving the pricing. So if you think about where we're at from a price cost perspective we like \u2013 we like where we're at. I mean, each of our segments was positive on the margin side here during the quarter. So I do think that as we sort of go forward that we've got \u2013 we've got our arms around the price cost and we feel pretty good. Mike Ryskin : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Good morning, Rainer. Congrats on a terrific print here. Maybe one in a simplest question on the guidance here Rainer. 2Q revenue to be by 650 basis points, it looks like bioprocessing your orders are strong, instruments are strong, execution coming in about what the annual guidance\u2019s we created; anything going on in second half or is this over to some given the macro? Rainer Blair : No, I think we feel continue to be really comfortable with our full year guide here. We've talked about the base business being high-single-digit here for some time. And we saw that play out here throughout the quarters. And we don't see any reason whether that is demand and the orders development or the backlog position that would give us pause as it relates to the high-single-digit base business guide that we have. Now as we talk about COVID testing I think you as many and all of us continue to do our best in terms of forecasting, what might be happening and testing at any given moment. But as we go forward with testing I think our perspective that Q3 in particular is sort of the slowest respiratory testing quarter of the year, is important to note. And then of course, as you go into Q4 respiratory season picks up again, and so we would expect to see that as well. And as I talked about there in my prepared remarks, we took up that that COVID testing number to about $2.5 billion here from around $2.2 billion. So we would also say it's important to think about China here. China recovered very well for us here in the second quarter after an unexpectedly long shutdown and we continue even today to see these sort of more limited spot shutdowns throughout the country. So we continue to watch that, but fundamentally expect the second half in China to be more constructive than it was here in the second quarter. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful comment from Rainer. Maybe one for McGrew here. Given increments were north of 40% in 2Q, I think the guide implies back half getting back to 25%. Any incremental inflation or FX impacts here on the back half that's dragging second half incrementals back to 25%. And I think in the past Matt you said LRP incremental should be 35% to 40%. Is that 35% to 40% applicable for a fiscal [indiscernible]? Matt McGrew : I'm sorry, was that fiscal 2023 you said? Vijay Kumar : Yes. It was a two-part question. One back half and [indiscernible], yes. Matt McGrew : Yes. So, I mean, maybe just \u2013 let me just be clear. We reiterate kind of what we said for the full year. I can give you a little bit of color on Q3, hopefully that sort of gets you where you need to be. I think, so let me recap what we said in the prepared remarks. Like Rainer just said, we reaffirmed high-single-digit core growth in the base business and overall kind of mid-single-digit core growth inclusive of test. Like we talked about a little bit earlier Q2, our performance gave us the ability to fully offset all over the second half FX headwinds. So you'll see that in sort of the margins. 400 million of incremental FX here since April talking about 1.3 billion, almost 5% for the full year from a revenue perspective, so no doubt for the second half will have. That FX will have an impact worse than it even did in the first half. But despite that additional FX headwind, we expect to be at the high-end of the range that we talked about earlier of 20% to 25% from a fall through perspective. So, I mean, just kind of give you that color of where we think we'll be here in the second half inclusive of FX headwind. And then for Q3, revenue is going to be down $200 million year-over-year, and that is all due to FX headwinds. So if you think about it, we're going to have, call it $400 million of FX headwinds, couple hundred million of core growth and acquisitions, but net-net we're going to be negative here in the year. And from a \u2013 I realize from a modeling perspective, it sort of fall through in a negative environment isn't all that meaningful. So I think maybe the easier way to think about where we're thinking about for Q3 is we're expecting our EBITDA margins to be about 30% in the quarter. And so hopefully with that, and then the full year frame, right on 20% to 25% you can kind of \u2013 it frames a little bit of what we're thinking about for sort of the back half from a margin perspective. Hopefully that's helpful. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Matt. I'm sorry that on 2023 is 35% to 40% still the right number to look at? Matt McGrew : Yes. I think barring any additional FX headwinds or something who knows what could happen out there these days, but barring anything else, barring FX or some sort of other macro event, yes, I think that's right 35% to 40% on our base business is a good way to think about margins as we head into 2023. We've talked about in the past how our margin profile has rerated from 30% to 35% to 35% to 40%, and there's no change to that. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful perspective. Thanks again gentlemen. Matt McGrew : Yes. Rainer Blair : Thanks Vijay. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning guys. Now that we're on the topic of FX; Matt, is FX more of a concern on, I mean, is it more of a translation issue for you guys or, or is there a certain level where the competitive dynamic that [indiscernible] product around from dollar based regions to non-dollar based? Matt McGrew : No, I think it's more the former, I mean it's really what we're seeing now Scott is just \u2013 it's not just the Euro, right? I mean, I think that's, that's kind of the key. Yes, that's the one that gets a lot of the headlines with sort of going to parody, but we really are seeing a breadth of FX headwinds globally that is sort of impacting things as we think about Latin America, as we think about Southeast Asia, we think about even China. It's starting to hit us in places where we just we don't have a cost base but we've got some revenues and that's a little bit different than maybe in the past where it was a little bit more Eurocentric for us. It's just really the breadth of the FX headwinds that I think have been sort of quite \u2013 it's quite surprising frankly, but that's what we've been seeing here in the first half Scott Davis : Guys, help us understand the logistics of pricing and some of your business. I know its different business like Beckman. Do you have to wait until kind of contracts kind of renew to get the price? Is it, I mean the big step up in price you had quarter-to-quarter and just a function of time and diagnostics? Rainer Blair : So I would tell you, it really does vary around the businesses. Absolutely we have contracts out there that have notification periods. Those notification periods and the way we manage contracts with nearly 100% visibility to when we can proactively move those prices is a big part of our pricing standard work. And in all businesses, including diagnostics we have been able to move pricing in the right direction, talked about the 400 basis points here in Q3. And as we think about sort of the second half, the first half between first quarter, second quarter was about 300 basis points let's call it. And that's a good \u2013 that's a good placeholder here, I think for the second half as well. Now, as you come to some businesses where contract terms are longer, let's say as a result of freights and other types of inflationary pressures, we are able to talk about other types of fees and up charges that are not directly related to price and that ends up providing us with the requisite uplift as well. Scott Davis : Well good luck. I'll pass it on. Thank you guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks Scott. Matt McGrew : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from Cowen. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Dan. Dan Brennan : Great, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I wanted to discuss a little bit about the last downturn and what we're beginning to see happen now. Obviously the company is dramatically different no forward, no dental and you've got all these great structural growth businesses that you've kind of taken on and are growing, particularly across all the biopharma areas. In the last downturn you were down 12% in 2019, but again such a different business. So maybe while we don't know what the magnitude and duration and the moving pieces or what the slow down and the recession, if we enter one we'll entail, clearly you're preparing for a bunch of different scenarios. So I'm hoping you can just maybe help us think about a framework for Danaher, the Street right now has you growing call it like 7% or so on the base for next year? Like, can you give us a sense of how we should consider the different businesses faring as the economy slows here across LS, TX and EMEA and its mid-single-digit, a reasonable downside case to think about or low-single digit. Just anything you can help us frame and again we don't know what the downturn will look like, but you're in a better position than we are to give us a sense of how your businesses will do? Rainer Blair : Sure. Dan, first of all I think you hit it on the head. We are a very different company today than we were in 2009, and some of that you already saw in 2020 where even as the country and the world shutdown, we only had one negative quarter and ended up being obviously very positive for the year even in 2020. But let's talk about, why here first? I mean, the portfolio transformation that was purpose driven has made Danaher far more resilient today than ever before. And let's talk \u2013 let's tease out why that is. I mean, first of all, over 40% of our portfolio \u2013 well, over 40% is in biopharma, genomics, molecular diagnostics, and all of these are supported by very, very strong secular growth drivers. And you heard me talk about those in the prepared remarks with a number of therapeutic projects that are in the, in the pipeline that drive so much value creation and activity in our industry. We also see population increases access to medical care increasing. So when we think about patient volumes around the world, we see those continuing to increase. So also from a diagnostic perspective, we're very well positioned. You think about EAS, the positioning there is water is becoming scarcer, unfortunately more polluted and requires more testing. The food supply is under pressure and so PID is very much involved in these kind of macro drivers as well. So we feel that from a portfolio perspective it's nearly purpose built for the world that we're in and the pressures that we live under. Now, you add to that 70% of our revenues or I should say over 75% of our revenues are recurring. And most of those are captive, meaning they're specked in or they're specific to our equipment and instruments along with these super durable business models, razor \u2013 razor blade and high service levels. So that's a very different kind of business that once again, I'd say it's purpose built for these type of things. Now you add to that our scale and our DBS led execution where even in tough and choppy times we're able to focus on what matters, which is our customers and execute in that environment. On top of the strength of our balance sheet we actually see these challenging macro environments as opportunities. So rather than battening down hatches here and having our head down, we're focused on executing continuously improving and taking advantage of the opportunities that the crisis can offer us. And so, as you think about our balance sheet position today, less than 2x net debt-to-EBITDA we're well positioned there for sure. And so looking ahead should a recession be there, or should the times get choppier? We're looking to get to the other side of that even stronger than we would enter that. Now, as we think about our 2023 guide, which I think, is what part of your question was trying to tease out, we feel good about our mid-single digit plus positioning there where for, for the long term, which we have talked about in a number of occasions. And when you unpack that a little bit, we see bioprocessing could be up high single digit and that's consistent with what we've spoken of. And as you look at bioprocessing, there we continue to think that the non-COVID business is going to be growing very strong. You saw what we're doing here in the second half of the year with growth rates, well, over 20% in non-COVID, and then we've also, de-risked the discussion here relating COVID related therapeutics and vaccines. We see $1 billion of revenue in 2022, and that's down from $2 billion in 2021. And we'd probably say $500 million for 2023. So 2021, $2 billion, 2022, $1 billion and 2023 $500 million for COVID-related vaccine. And having said all that, we still see our biotechnology business growing at high single digits. And that leads you then with COVID testing. And we've talked about that at length. We speak to our customers about that. They still think that COVID goes endemic at the end of 2023, beginning of 2024. And we still think our framework of about $1.2 billion of COVID testing revenue in 2023, which is roughly around 30 million tests, is the right way to think about it. So when you put all that together we feel very good about the way we're positioned here from a core growth perspective, think mid-single digit plus on the base business. And then, from a COVID headwind perspective, think low-single, mid-single headwind overall giving you a solid low single digit 2023. Dan Brennan : Great, thanks Rainer. Maybe just one quick follow-up and just as it pertains to China, could you just flush out a little bit obviously the quarter progressed better than expect, and you gave some color about the [indiscernible] continuing. But kind of how do we think about implicit in your full year guide, like, what is China expected to do? And are you expecting or baking in a completely normal China, absent diagnostic for the back half? Rainer Blair : For a normal year, we would see China in the low double digits, low teen kind of growth. We'd say for the full year, this year in view of what we've seen in the first half, high single digits is the way to think about China, which we consider to be strong growth in view of some of the macro challenges that China is facing today. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : Good morning. First question I had is on bioprocessing. So just to follow-up the $1 billion updated COVID guide for the year, can you just provide how much was in the first half? And then the assumption for the second half, could you just talk about what you're assuming related to boosters or government contracts, just how you build up to the $1 billion? Rainer Blair : So just to repeat here, Jack, for everybody 2021, $2 billion of revenue, 2022, $1 billion of COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue, I think, it's fair to say that that trails off here towards the second half of the year, getting you to for that 2023 run rate that I talked about we're $500 million for the year. So some of this stuff is lumpy. So it can go back and forth in a quarter, but that's the general downdraft. Matt McGrew : Maybe just to put some numbers to it, I'd say it's called a little over 500 in the first half, and then little around 400 or so a little under, in the second half, you can see that sort of the magnitude as the drop get to the $1 billion. Jack Meehan : Got it. Yes, that makes sense. Rainer Blair : In terms of boosters and annual shots, look as you know the public health official discussion there continues. Our belief is that it is likely that there is going to be a regular vaccination schedule. It remains to be seen what the uptake of that vaccination will be. But if it is on the order of what flu vaccination is in the country, the kind of numbers that we talked about for 2023 perhaps a little bit less much longer term is probably the order of magnitude in an endemic vaccination regime. Jack Meehan : That makes sense. And I also had a follow-up on China. So you grew high single digits, the guide was for down mid to high single digits. And that was despite the fact the lockdowns were longer than expected. I guess my question is simple. How do you pull it off? Can you just talk about instruments versus consumables, just what kind of the shape of the quarter will look like? Rainer Blair : Well, first and foremost, this is about a team stepping up to the plate and executing. Our associates were ahead of the game, proactively working with the various levels of government, municipal, province and then sometimes even national to ensure that we got the necessary approvals very, very quickly in order to be able to open up our facilities again. At the same time our supply chain associates were prepared ahead of the game understanding what it would take to make a quarter, the raw materials that needed to be available, the shift size that needed to be available and the number of shipment hours that they had in order to work through it. And then we have to say our manufacturing associates literally lived in the plants, literally lived in the plants. We built showers, they had cots, we had food and clothing brought in as well as the necessary services to what needed to come back out in order to facilitate what is nothing but extraordinary execution with the highest level of commitment. And as you think about that whether it's instruments or whether it is consumables, it was across the board, those things that were manufactured locally, I just talked about those people in the plants, but also those things that were imported and had the risk of being stuck in the ports as you know, you sort of unwound the congestion associated with the shutdown. Our people were at the front of the line, making sure that our goods got in first and got to the customers were installed, were signed off and are in use today. Jack Meehan : Very nice. Thank you, Rainer. Rainer Blair : Thanks Jack. Operator : Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan. Rainer Blair : Hi, Rachel. Good morning. Rachel Vatnsdal : Thanks. Good morning guys. Yes, congrats on the nice quarter. So first off on COVID testing, so those obviously came in higher than expected, but I'd like to really dig into the mix of fluid versus standalone. So you were anticipating 10% of the four-in-one test this quarter and 90% stand-alone, but that sounds like it came in about fifty-fifty. So that mix has increasingly been skewed towards the four-in-one product in recent quarters. So how are you thinking about that mix shift moving forward in the back half of the year? And then what's the mix that's anticipated in 30 million tests for next year? Matt McGrew : Yes, so as we think about \u2013 this quarter was you're right it was closer to fifty-fifty. As we sort of think about Q3 what we are sort of hearing, we think that it's going to look a little bit more like the mix we saw Q3 of last year, which was 80% COVID only, 20% four-in-one. So on that, on our 325 million call it 8 million tests or so that we think we do think it'll be kind of skewed a little bit more like it was last year. So like Rainer said too, just to give you some context, I mean, Q3 has historically been the slowest respiratory quarter of the year. And as we sort of talk to our customers, I think, that their expectation as well as we get into the summer here it does typically become sort of the slowest time and then picks back up in the winter. As we get into Q4, I would say that that mix assumption will be more like the fifty-fifty that we saw here and that we saw last winter as well. So I think if you think about Q4, we're talking about $525 million of revenue, maybe 11 million tests or something along those lines in a split of fifty-fifty. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you. And then on biotech funding concerns, so obviously there has been a number of concerns about the potential slowdown in biotech funding leading to a smaller funnel at earlier stage biotech companies, as they try to rationalize candidates to conserve cash. And so you flagged a number of stats on the positive pipeline for monoclonal antibodies, cell and gene therapy, et cetera, the prepared remarks. So can you just walk us through, have you seen any impact or shift in demand from that mid-biotech customer segment as a result of these funding concerns? And then how should we think about \u2013 let's say that we face a prolonged constrained funding environment for these mid-biotechs. At what point do you think that could really start to impact that Phase 2, Phase 3 part of the pipeline where it starts to become meaningful from a volume perspective, which is obviously the main driver of that bioprocesing business. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Rachel. Rachel, as you just suggested the majority of these biotech\u2019s are either preclinical or in the very early stages of clinical. And it's really important to note that our business is driven by what's happening in Phase 3 and ultimately commercialized drugs. Over 75% of our business is in that later stage. And so then as you go upstream from that that has less of an impact. And now getting specifically to your point, we really haven't seen much of an impact of the biotech funding crunch here affecting the customer activity levels that we have. And frankly, we do look at these biotech\u2019s and the proposals that they are pursuing whether there is proof-of-concept and data. And our sense is that the good projects, and where the data is solid and convincing, and proof-of-concept is given, they are continuing to attract funding. So we think that today's cash positions in the biotech\u2019s, the quality of the projects that they are presuming as well as the funding environment still providing funding to those that are able to provide data continues to be quite positive and is not impacting our business. Now, of course, to your longer term question, we just have to see that the biotech area is a cauldron of innovation. That's where the risks are taken. That's where the out of the box thinking oftentimes occurs. And that's where the Genentechs and the Amgens and others started and many more that are huge public companies today. So, we of course longer term will want to see that the funding continues to support that kind of innovation environment. But today are not concerned about what we see here for the next call it 18, 24 months. Operator : Our next question \u2013 our last question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Rainer Blair : Hi Patrick. Good morning. Patrick Donnelly : Hey Rainer, how are you? Thanks for taking the question. Maybe another one just cleaning up on 2023. I really appreciate all the color you gave. It sounds like with all the moving pieces, in terms of COVID headwinds, we'll probably shake out maybe in a little more low-single than the mid-single for 2023. And I'm just trying to figure out, I guess, with all the mix changes again, being a little less, COVID more heavy on the core, what the right way to think about the incrementals is? I mean, it sounds like Matt earlier was talking about kind of getting back to that 35%, 40%. But just wanted to circle up in terms of the moving pieces. Again, given the mix shift, I assume FX will still be a bit of a headwind in the first half. I mean, it's still a bit away, but we'll see what the dollar does. But can you just talk through, I guess, that margin structure as we work our way into 2023, given again, the growth is looking a little more, low single with the COVID headwinds that you laid out? Matt McGrew : Yes, sure. I mean, I think, maybe just kind of, like you said, get everybody grounded that, that low single is overall the base business we think would be mid-single digit plus and the COVID headwinds which are all testing at this point would be sort of down low- to mid-single to get to a low single overall. And so, as I think about my 2023 margin profile, like I said before, it's difficult right now, given how dynamic things are, especially with the FX, and inflation and supply chains. But I think where we are from an execution perspective here in the quarter where we think we'll be, if we don't have any we might have some FX headwinds, but let's see where that ends up. But if we don't have any extra new headwinds that show up, I just think the normal VCM of 35% to 40% is the place to be. I mean, the COVID testing like you've seen, I mean, it's more or less at the fleet average, we've talked about how we sort of intentionally did that. We price it exactly the same as we price flu. So it's not as if it has a huge outsized necessarily impact. So I still think the right place to be from a margin perspective is that fall through of 35%, 40% on those single digits. But I think given that we're going to grow that base business mid-single digit plus, with that sort of fall through, I still think you would see even in that low-single digit environment, I still think we drive EPS growth. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful, Matt. I appreciate that. And then Rainer you touched a little bit on the M&A landscape, obviously I don't think there is any doubt you guys have the capacity and the balance sheet is healthy. I think the questions are more around are the sellers ready? Or are valuation still kind of resetting in boardrooms? What are the conversations like for you guys? Again, it seems like your appetite is certainly high to your point, macro uncertainty tends to favor you guys, you tend to see a little bit of panic out there sometimes and sellers kind of hit the bid. So can you just talk about conversations? Are people starting to warm up a little bit, or is it still a lot of kind of pointing back six months and maybe we bounce back, maybe we don't, what are the conversations like on that front? Rainer Blair : Well, the 52-week high has not moved out of the window entirely. But I do think it's fair to say that people are understanding that we're entering into a new environment here that there's a change of the cycle here. We see COVID tailwinds dissipating, many were riding that wave. Higher interest rates are real for everyone. And then of course, these foreign exchange rate issues that Matt was talking about and inflation are real too. So I think that changed macro and the reality of valuations is starting to seep in to the boardroom discussions. But it's still early days. And we continue to watch that we're of course engaged, our funnels are very healthy and as always we are looking for those opportunities that align with our strategy and end market focus, as well as then, of course, premier assets in that particular area, along with the right valuation. So if you noted our balance sheet we're primed here and look at the market with opportunity. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thank you guys. Rainer Blair : Thank you. Operator : And that is all the time we have for today. And I will turn the program back over to our speakers. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Gretchen. And thanks everyone for joining us today. We will be around all day for follow-ups. Bye. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well, thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let's jump right in. Our positive momentum continued in the third quarter with 10% core revenue growth and solid earnings and cash flow performance. This strength was based across the portfolio with high single-digit or better core growth in all three reporting segments. We're particularly pleased with the consistent performance of our base business which has grown high single digits or better for nine consecutive quarters. Now these well-rounded results were driven by our team's outstanding execution through a challenging operating environment. They've done a terrific job running the Danaher playbook to proactively reduce structural costs while continuing to accelerate high-impact growth investments. We believe our ability to deliver meaningful innovation and reliably serve customers, has contributed to market share gains in many of our businesses. Now during the quarter, we also announced our intention to separate our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment to create a publicly-traded company. This new company, which we'll refer to as EAS for now, will be well positioned in the most attractive areas of the water quality and product identification market. EAS will be comprised of outstanding businesses with strong ESG fundamentals, durable business models and a very attractive financial profile, averaging mid-single-digit core revenue growth over the last five years with 55% recurring revenue today and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. Now as a stand-alone company, EAS will have greater opportunities to meaningfully deploy capital towards M&A. And of course, EAS will have the Danaher Business System as its foundation, along with the commitment to continuous improvement that will support the same outstanding results EAS as a part of Danaher today. Of course, we look forward to sharing more details here in the coming months. As for Danaher, this separation will establish us as a more focused science and technology leader committed to innovation and making a profound impact on human health. We've got a great lineup of leading franchises positioned in highly attractive life sciences and diagnostics end markets, all united by a common set of durable, high recurring revenue business models. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitive advantage in these areas, and we see tremendous opportunities to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance. So with that, let's turn to our third quarter results in more detail. Sales were $7.7 billion, and we delivered 10% core revenue growth, including 8.5% core growth in our base business. Respiratory testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter. Geographically, we continue to see strong demand across the developed markets despite current macroeconomic and geopolitical events. North America's core revenue was up high teens with all three segments delivering double-digit or better core revenue growth. Core revenue in Western Europe grew high single digits with customer activity and funding levels remaining healthy. High gross markets core revenues were up mid-single digits. In China, our teams effectively managed through ongoing COVID-19 headwinds to deliver high single-digit growth in the quarter. Our gross profit margin for the third quarter was 59.8%, and our operating margin was 26.3%. We had 50 basis points of core operating margin expansion, driven in part by disciplined cost management, productivity measures and price actions. The operating environment remains dynamic across our businesses globally, but we experienced fewer supply chain disruptions in the third quarter. Logistics improved as freight costs began to stabilize. We also saw modest improvements in material availability, though certain electronic components remained difficult to procure. Despite these challenges, our teams have done an outstanding job taking proactive measures and leveraging the DBS tool set to minimize the impact of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.50 were up 7% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.2 billion year-to-date. So now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. In our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 4% and core revenue was up 8%. Strength was broad-based with most businesses achieving high single-digit or better core revenue growth. In Bioprocessing, robust activity levels drove over 20% growth in our non-COVID business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. As expected, our customers continue to transition away from COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic program and into programs for other modalities. We expect these trends to continue through the fourth quarter resulting in high single-digit core revenue growth in our Bioprocessing business for the full year. In September, we hosted an Investor Day at Cytiva to showcase our Bioprocessing business and highlighted the tremendous long-term growth opportunities we're positioned for in biologics and genomic medicine. We also announced that we're bringing together Cytiva and Pall's Life Sciences as the biotechnology group. The combined portfolio has the broadest offering in the industry with end-to-end solutions across all major therapeutic modalities for monoclonal antibodies to emerging cell, gene and mRNA-based therapies. The biotechnology group will have unmatched global scale with the industry's largest commercial team, allowing us to further extend the reach of our best-in-class customer service. We also believe focused innovation across the joint portfolio will ensure our products and solutions are aligned to best meet customers' needs around quality, yield and cost. With Pall's Life Sciences and Cytiva joining forces, the Biotechnology Group is uniquely positioned to help our customers become more efficient and bring more life-saving therapies to market faster. Moving to our Life Sciences instrument businesses. They collectively delivered double-digit base business core revenue growth, led by SCIEX, Leica Microsystems and Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Funding levels remains strong globally, and we saw solid customer demand across most major end markets. We continued our strong pace of innovation in life sciences with the introduction of Beckman Coulter's Biomet Ingenious. The Ingenious is a cost-effective easy-to-use sample preparation system that reduces manual transfers and hands-on time and next-gen sequencing library construction. This is a great example of how our investments in innovation are delivering impactful solutions to our customers. Our genomics businesses had another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, led by strong demand for plasmic, RNA and next-generation sequencing solutions. This quarter, marked Aldevron's first anniversary as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance. Financially, the results speak for themselves, with more than 30% year-over-year revenue growth since acquisition. The team has done a tremendous job embracing DBS tools and processes to meaningfully reduce lead times and increase capacity. Now this capacity is certainly supporting customers' needs today, but it's equally important to support Aldevron the long-term growth outlook. With a view towards the future, we're excited about the opportunities to collaborate across our genomics businesses and create unique solutions to help our customers accelerate the development and commercialization of mRNA and other nucleic acid-based therapies. Moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 13.5%, led by nearly 30% core revenue growth at Cepheid. Leica Biosystems grew mid-teens in the quarter, driven by strength in core histology and advanced staining. As customers seek to improve productivity within their labs, we're seeing strong early momentum for Leica innovation, BOND-PRIME, a fully automated advancing platform. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics delivered solid results with mid-single-digit core growth despite ongoing COVID-19 headwinds in China. In Molecular Diagnostics, core revenue across Cepheid's non-respiratory test menu grew approximately 10%, led by double-digit growth in virology and infectious disease testing. In respiratory testing, global PCR volumes have moderated, but demand is still elevated for symptomatic testing at the point of care where Cepheid is the gold standard. Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $875 million exceeded our expectations of approximately $325 million. Higher prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses, combined with advanced purchases by customers in anticipation of a more severe respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, led to both higher volumes and a preference for our four-in-one test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV. Now we're starting to see our customers consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platforms onto Cepheid gene expert. The gene expert provides significant value to clinicians with a unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow. Customers are also increasingly interested in opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading testament. Our opportunity funnel for non-respiratory tests has increased significantly this year and we see opportunities to continue gaining market share moving forward. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 5% and core revenue was up 10.5%. Water quality was up mid-teens, and product identification grew low single digits. Electronic identification, marking and coding was up low single digits and packaging and color management grew mid-single digits. Videojet was up low single digits, in part due to a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew low double digits in Q3 last year. Now during the quarter, we saw strength in food and beverage as well as the consumer end markets. In Water Quality, ChemTreat and Hach each grew high teens during the third quarter. Demand for analytical chemistries and consumables remain solid across our major end markets, municipal and industrial project activity was broadly consistent with the first half of the year, driving solid equipment growth. Now last week at WesTech, the annual wastewater trade show, the water quality team highlighted several solutions that are improving the efficiency and sustainability of the water treatment process. POC's Ultra Low Range Chlorine Analyzer raises the industry standard to parts per billion chemical detection levels, helping customers extend the membrane life of their treatment systems and reduce maintenance costs. At Trojan, innovative solutions such as Trojan UV Signa and Trojan UV 3000+ reduced environmental impact by treating water with ultraviolet light instead of traditional chemical disinfection method. Every day, over 1 billion people benefit from water treated by Trojan. So these are just a few examples of how our water quality platform is supporting customers day-to-day, mission-critical water operations and making a positive impact on the world. So with that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a high single to low double-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing, resulting in a core revenue growth being flat to down low single digits in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%. Now for the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We now expect high single-digit overall core revenue growth, which is up from our prior expectation of mid-single digits as a result of our strong COVID-19 testing performance in the third quarter. We continue to expect operating profit fall through of approximately 25% for the full year. So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our third quarter results. Our well-rounded performance really is a testament to our team's commitment to innovating and executing in support of our customers. These results also reinforce Danaher's strength and durability. Our differentiated portfolio is well positioned in attractive end markets with long-term secular growth drivers and our business models are resilient with nearly 75% of our revenue today being recurring. So putting it all together, the strength of our portfolio and balance sheet, combined with our talented team and the power of the proactive application of the Danaher Business System, provides an outstanding foundation for delivering sustainable long-term results. So with that, I'll turn it back over to John. John Bedford : Thanks, Rainer. Shelby, that concludes formal comments, and we're now ready for questions here. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : So, obviously, there's a lot of questions on the Bioprocessing market given one of your competitors in that market was talking about inventory stocking yesterday and which hit the sector. Can you just sort of elaborate on what you're seeing in a little bit more detail on Bioprocessing inventories? Also, we've gotten the question -- you're talking about high single-digit growth for the full year. I think you commented high single to double-digit prior quarter. So can you sort of walk us through the dynamics? Are you still looking for like $1 billion in COVID vaccine for this year? Just a lot more color what's going on given that's going to be -- given how sensitive topic that is? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Derek. And let me get right after that question here. So First of all, let's talk about 2022, and I'll certainly speak about the inventory topic here as well. I think Important to reiterate that overall, we're seeing very strong customer demand in Bioprocessing, and we expect to finish 2022 with high single-digit core growth. Now that splits up in a number of sections. Let's start with the non-COVID Bioprocessing is growing well over 20%, and we continue to see that. And the underlying fundamentals here are the funding is there, the clinical trials continue to progress. The pipeline is strong. We're seeing product move into commercial production from Phase 3 and this has really accelerated across all modalities. So sure, monoclonal antibodies, but yes, we're even seeing cell and gene therapy starting to gain their approvals. Additionally, pricing is above historical levels, which is driving some incremental growth, if you will, on top of the underlying demand in the non-COVID areas. Now as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, customers do continue to move away from COVID-related projects. And I don't think that's a surprise to any of us. That's something that we have been speaking about for some time. And in fact, we can confirm that, that is happening. And I think it also reconciles with what we're seeing in the marketplace. We're seeing that vaccines, our uptake is relatively slow. People are unsure if the current vaccine inventories will address the newest variance. So, there's a bit of uncertainty there, I think, in the public as to where we go from a vaccine perspective. And that reflects naturally in what we have seen here with customers starting to move to the other modalities and drive the projects that they had on hold forward. And for us, that manifests here in for the full year that we see $800 million of COVID revenues in Bioprocessing as opposed to the $1 billion that we had been talking about previously. So, we do see customers moving away from these COVID projects and driving their energies, their efforts, and their financial resources into the other projects, and that helps explain why we see the larger part of the business growing at well over 20%. Now, we are not seeing significant stocking, but we do see pockets of stocking, particularly there where there were large COVID-related, either therapeutic or vaccine programs. So, those players that heavily invested in large programs here those players that, in fact, have higher inventories than is normally the case. Having said that, those large players also are those, which are best positioned to redeploy those inventories to other projects. So, we do expect an inventory burn down with those players here in the coming quarters. So that's the inventory situation there, Derik. And then as it relates to some of the other points here, I think we continue to be -- and I just want to reaffirm the high single-digit growth. We're high single digit here year-to-date, and that's how we see ourselves in Bioprocessing concluding the year. Derik De Bruin : Got it. And the order book, the growth in the order book for Bioprocessing on the non-COVID growth there? Rainer Blair : Sure. Sure, Derik. So for Q3, our orders are down over 20% as expected. And I think that's a number which bears some commentary and context. First of all, we're coming off of order comps that are well in excess of 50% in the prior year. And so it's important to take in order to be able to rationalize these numbers that sometimes are viewed in isolation with the right context. The three-year order stack is over 20%. And I think something that is perhaps not as well known and that bears some conversation is we and many others have meaningfully reduced our lead time. And we've done that through capacity investments. We've done that through productivity investments. We've been able to do that because the supply chain has become more secure. And that's a pretty significant impact on the order placement cadence of our customers. So just to mention an example here, if lead times go from 52 weeks, which has been the case in some product categories in the marketplace, to 12 weeks, customers fundamentally change their order patterns. To give you a sense of that, if a customer wanted to order over time four bioreactors, they would order all four bioreactors at one, if there's a 52-week lead time. But if it's a 12-week lead time, they would order one bioreactor and then follow up with other orders in the future. So what we're seeing right now is really the normalization of the marketplace coming from a red-hot pandemic fuel time of constraint a long lead times for orders ramped up significantly. So order rates ramped up significantly to the supply chain now normalizing and customers adjusting their order cadence. And then yes, of course, the COVID volumes are down. That's expected. We've been talking about that, but we also see the strength of the non-COVID market. And keep in mind, that's a much larger market. And currently, it is growing at well over 20% and there's a backlog to be burned down there because previously COVID had been prioritized. So, the orders were negative to repeat, but not unexpectedly and to be seen in the context of a market that is now readjusting. Matt McGrew : And Derik, you had asked about the non-COVID as well. So if you think about the book-to-bill there in the quarter, it was essentially 1.0. Derik De Bruin : I'm sorry, what? Matt McGrew : Essentially, 1, 1.0. Derik De Bruin : Okay. Got it. And do you still -- and just one final question. Do you still expect to take significant price across the portfolio next year? Rainer Blair : We continue to think about price as a lever for us. And we think that lever is available to us next year as well. We have taken the necessary steps to do that. We're over 400 basis points here in the quarter. That's up from 300 basis points in the first half of the year. We expect the fourth quarter to be similar, and we're going to try and keep that momentum going here in the new year as well. Matt McGrew : And that commentary is overall, Derik, but I don't think that, that would be any different for Bioprocessing numbers. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Go back a little bit to Cepheid. Are there costs -- I would imagine that cost was not a main focus when you were supplying just extreme demand for quite the last couple of years. But are there costs or is there a playbook where cost can come out of the business and to give you a little bit of a tailwind on the margin side while growth kind of stabilizes? Rainer Blair : So we have, as you suggested, invested significantly in order to drive -- to be able to supply the demand here during the pandemic and watch very carefully where our capacity needs to be, one, to, of course, serve the needs of the pandemic, but also to fuel the growth in our non-COVID testing business. And that continues to grow very well here. You saw the very strong growth we had in COVID, but not to be underestimated, the very nice 10% growth in non-COVID off of a very strong comp in the prior year. So capacity for us is an area of great focus. And we're able to adjust that capacity up and downwards, both in terms of units of capacity, but also cost adds we need. So that is a relatively flexible lever for us, and we'll continue to adjust that lever up or down, both from a capacity perspective as well as a cost perspective as required. Scott Davis : So that's helpful. And let's -- if we can go a little bit bigger picture. Reiner, when you think about the M&A funnel, how wide is the lens. You guys obviously have a lot of big focus asking. Rainer Blair : I would characterize our lens as broad and not limited to cell and gene therapy. We want to have a profound impact on human health, Scott. We've talked about that here now for some time, and that allows us a very large space in order to identify investment opportunities, capital deployment opportunities. And as such, our funnel is wide and deep and very active as always. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congratulations on a good steady print here this morning. Just maybe back on the vaccine question. I appreciate all the color. And I know given that we don't have the order numbers, I know what you implied by the lead times coming down, but just maybe to put a finer point on that. Is your outlook for Bioprocessing including vaccines, I think Danaher expected high singles for '23. Has that changed? And I think prior expectation was $0.5 billion of vaccine revenue for next year. Has that changed? Rainer Blair : As you can imagine, we're very focused on delivering the fourth quarter here and the full year. But as we think about '23, and I say that because there's a lot of data points to collect here in the fourth quarter as well in such a dynamic environment. And so as we think about the Bioprocessing business for 2023, we still think that there is room for $500 million of COVID opportunity in order to support the needs of the population, the variance to replenish expired sell-by dates and all the things that you can think about. But of course, that's a number that we watch very closely. More importantly, we think that the non-COVID business, which, of course, will again proportionately be a much larger part of the business, will continue to be very robust. Funding levels are there, the number of modalities that continue to grow in the pipeline is broad, our own project activity in early, mid- and late stage is very strong. So, we do not have a different view on 2023 for Bioprocessing today. But of course, it's a fluid situation, and we continue to watch all of that, and we'll update in January when we speak again. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Rainer. And just to sort of clarify, any change here, that sensitivity would be on the vaccine side, but not on the base correct? Derik De Bruin : That's correct. That's the way we see it for sure today. And recall, I mentioned just a minute ago to Derik that in 2022, we were expecting $1 billion of COVID vaccine, therapeutic revenue. We've taken that down to $800 million. It is, of course, offset by the non-COVID business so that we deliver that high single digits here in 2023 for file process. And then looking forward to 2023, we would see that going from $800 million to $500 million. Vijay Kumar : Appreciate the color, Rainer. Matt, One quick one for you. Based on current FX rates, and I think your assumptions on pricing for next year, how should we think about incremental margins for '23? Matt McGrew : For '23? Vijay Kumar : Yes. Matt McGrew : I'm going to go ahead and ask that we get through Q4 here and see where it is. If I had to guess on the FX margins today, I would have been wrong a quarter ago and wrong the quarter before that. So we'll give you a full update on '23. I mean I think you've seen where the margins have gone to. You know that we're going to have an FX headwind next year on the top line of probably, call it, $800 million. So you can probably start there. I would say that the fall-through on that is probably going to be the pretty typical 35% to 40% fall through. And that could be a little bit better or worse depending on where that revenue actually comes in from a mix perspective. But that's probably the best I can give you now, what we know what the rates are. But from a full margin perspective, I'll have to wait until we get a little bit closer and to our guidance in '23. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dan Brennan with Cowen and Company. Dan Brennan : If I may, just Rainer, I know on the last call, and it was already addressed in some of the Bioprocessing information. But when you look more broadly, obviously, you see a lot of mixed signals on the macro. Last call, you had suggested all-in organic mid-single and if you factor in the COVID would roll off low single digits, like any updated thinking on how you think about that? I know you've already addressed the bioprocess side, but just wondering for the other parts of the business, kind of how those are playing out right now? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Dan. So, I think we are still in that ZIP code here, specifically, if we think about our base business without testing, so our business without COVID testing. For 2023, we still see that as mid-single-digit plus. And of course, we're watching. There's a lot of headlines in Western Europe and emerging markets, but to date, our business momentum does not indicate any dramatic slowdown here. And so we think mid-single-digit plus from today's point of view, for the base business is the right way to think about it. And as we go forward here and Matt mentioned this, of course, we're looking at all the data points daily here. And then in January, we'll update you again, but from today's perspective, mid-single-digit plus for the base business. And then as it relates to COVID testing, we do still anticipate that step down, the experts that we speak with, our customers still think that COVID is endemic by the end of '23, beginning of '24 and that will step down there from where we've been here, close to 50 million tests to about 30 million tests or the $1.2 billion roughly of COVID revenue. And then lastly, I'll say, the FX situation is very dynamic. We've been talking about that. And I think Matt covered that as well. Dan Brennan : Great. And then just maybe one more follow-up. I don't want to kind of continue to readdress Bioprocessing, but I'm just wondering, you talked about bringing in lead times dramatically, which suggests that customers aren't going to need to order as far in advance, right, because you've got them down significantly. The peer yesterday talked about inventories at 12 months versus six months and I know you addressed inventories in one of the prior questions. But can you just speak to it just one more comment, and I apologize, is on the base business. I believe you've done a better job from prior conversations about maybe managing and kind of avoiding some double ordering. But just kind of what do you see broadly on the inventory side for your base business? And kind of how does that kind of impact your outlook for the base power production business as we look forward to '23? Rainer Blair : We have been as a result of the pandemic, even closer than traditionally working with our customers to understand their production plans and to ensure that they are not overstocking at the expense of others who would need the product. And what was a time of constraint here for the last, call it, 18, 20 months. So as a result of that, we feel as though we are well positioned to understand the inventory situation. We do regular surveys with our customers. And as a result of that, we don't believe that there is a general overstocking in the market. Having said that, we do think there are pockets where inventories are high. And those are based on customers ultimately changing their production plans, in other words, canceling orders specifically for COVID. And so the large COVID players whether that be for vaccine production or whether that be for therapeutics production, they have larger inventories and those will likely exceed six months of inventory. But I think it's important to note that those large players have many programs, and they're able to redeploy that inventory. In most cases, these are not tailor-made solutions for any specific molecule and can be redirected and burn down using -- in the use for other modalities or other programs at the same modality. So we do see that the market is currently resetting itself from, as I mentioned, a red-hot pandemic era of constraint with long lead times to one where lead times and supply chain disruptions are starting to normalize and then add to that the cancellation of some COVID vaccine or therapeutic plans just because the uptake hasn't been the same or the variants have rendered them not usable for that application. So, we are confident that the strength of this market and its fundamentals, remain very, very strong. Biologics, in all the modalities that we've talked about are very underpenetrated in the market, and it is a matter of getting the penetration up launching the new products in the pipeline that we'll continue to drive the growth of this market despite the reset that we see going on in the supply chain. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse. Dan Leonard : So my first question, Rainer, I was hoping you could elaborate on trends in China across your different OpCos? I think you said growth was high single digits in total, but flagged some weakness in diagnostic. So just wondering, if you could offer more color by OpCo? Rainer Blair : Sure. So as you just said, just to level set, you see high single-digit growth here in China, both for Q3 and we anticipate a similar level in Q4. And that's really a broad-based strength there. Let me start with Diagnostics where we did see patient volumes impacted by these rolling shutdowns. So this zero COVID policy shutdown that you're likely reading about in China. So that affected patient volumes and think of those as being 90% to 95% of what they were in 2021. And we're working through those and continue to see China as really a very, very strong market. Now lastly, the rest of our business continues to be very, very strong. As you think about life science instruments, as you think about EAS, as you think about the diagnostics, the other diagnostics companies, we continue to see robust demand there. And as patient volumes normalize, which we expect to happen sometime in the next year, we're confident that China continues to be a really strong growth lever here for the future. Matt McGrew : And Dan, just to give you some context, I mean, life sciences and EAS were both up high single digits in the quarter. And Diagnostics, while it did struggle a little on the patient volumes, I mean, it was still up mid-single digits. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that color. And Matt, just a quick follow-up. Can you talk about the impact of higher interest rates on the business? Did that change at all how you're managing the balance sheet or your capital allocation priorities? Matt McGrew : I don't think so. From a balance sheet perspective, we don't really have -- we've got no variable sort of debt, so that doesn't really impact us. I'm trying to think -- I mean, it might have spots here or there from things like currency swaps that we've done and interest income. But I mean those are pretty minor. I mean, I don't think we think of capital allocation in a different way. I mean, I think we still sort of go through the same processes from an M&A perspective and a return perspective and interest has always been a component of that. So I don't think it really changes all that much on how we're thinking about : A, running the business the balance sheet, given where we're at on fixed sort of mostly fixed debt here, and I don't think it really impacts us on our thinking about doing something different than what we do, which is allocate capital towards M&A largely. Operator : We'll take our next question from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Luke Sergott : So I want to talk about the instrument growth. It looks like another big quarter for SCIEX and LMS. This is following a very strong first half of the year. Can you just give us a sense of where all the demand is coming from? Is this like a new facility build-out? Or are these from upgrades? And then how does -- how do think about this from a comp perspective, how you guys are thinking about it for next year? Rainer Blair : Just a level set, our Life Science instrument business grew low double digits in Q3. And as you pointed out, this is really led by Leica Microsystems, SCIEX, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences with some very, very strong results. And I think the strength of that comes from two areas. The first is the end markets continue to be very strong. So especially pharma, CROs and academic research continues to be well funded, and we're seeing strong buying behavior there, especially towards instruments that provide the necessary answers here in the research. And that's really the newest generation of instruments. And that brings me really to the second pillar of the strength that we've seen there, which is our continued innovation performance there, with all of the operating companies really leaning in and launching leading edge really pushing science further instruments. And I'll give you some examples at SCIEX, ZenoTOF 7600 and the Triple Quad 7500. At LMS, you have the THUNDER widefield imaging system, and we talked about the Mika launch, which is doing extraordinarily well. And then we just talked about the Ingenious launch here at Beckman Life Sciences. So, we're really seeing strength from a funding perspective, and we believe that on top of that, we're outperforming because of the innovation strength that we've shown here, launching a number of great solutions. Now from a comp perspective, we really do think that the strength in the market is sustained. We expect that to be the case in the fourth quarter. And in 2023, like I said, we'll talk about that more in January, but we don't have reason to believe here that this will be significantly different. Luke Sergott : All right. That's helpful. And then when you're thinking about -- when you called out the supply chain, right, and things are starting to get better. Can you talk about where you're seeing the biggest relief in your end markets or businesses and where you're still seeing things constrained and not getting better? Rainer Blair : Sure. So I think the first place where you're starting to see some of the pressure dissipates is in the logistics area. So, logistic capacities have ramped. We're starting to see greater availability. We're also starting to see freight rates come down, specifically if you think of container freight Those, in particular, have come down quite significantly. And that, of course, is helpful with the global businesses that we have. At the same time, we do see continued pressure on a more limited set of electronic components. So with the Danaher Business System, call it, we've been able to really knock down 80% of the issues there. And I think with that, able to continue to take share because of the availability of our solutions. And with 20%, we're still in countermeasure mode. And I would say that number continues to get smaller every day, but there's still on the electronic component side, some tightness here. And then lastly, I would just say, what is still the same as labor continues to be tight. That is the case, practically everywhere we operate. And so that that's a constraint that we would expect to see get better here over the next 12 to 18 months, but currently still see that as an area to watch out for. Operator : We'll take our last question from Patrick Dolly with Citi. Patrick Dolly : Maybe just one. You touched on China, but maybe on Europe, a lot of macro concerns kind of popped up their heads there over the last couple of quarters. Can you just talk about what you're seeing, again, across the different OpCos there? Any change in terms of your expectations or any elevated concerns as we work away even into '23 with some of the kind the kind of power rationing and things that are happening there, maybe just your exposure, any customer conversations, how you're feeling in that region? Rainer Blair : Starting with Q3 here just to level set. We had high single-digit growth in Western Europe, and we would expect that comparable here going into the quarter. Our funnels continue to be strong. And I would say that we're starting to see deal velocity slow a little bit. So it is clear that people are starting to think about where they're going to invest their cash at least for Q3 and Q4, we're still seeing robust demand and robust funding. Having said that, and in view of everything we read in the news as to you, we continue to watch that very closely to see whether that sustains going forward into '23. And of course, we're going to talk to you about that again in January. Now as it relates to our own exposure, specifically as it relates to energy, we continue for many reasons to take a very close look at our energy consumption, so also from a sustainability perspective. But now particularly this becomes an area of focus for Europe. And in fact, we do not have a lot of heavy manufacturing, so energy-intensive manufacturing in Europe. It's mostly light assembly, and we have taken the measures to ensure energy supply continuity through the appropriate backup systems. And then in the event of, if you will, fuel rationing, whether that's gas oil or otherwise, we also have contingency plans there to ensure that we're able to reduce our demand, but still supply mission-critical capabilities, including manufacturing, should that become the case. So yes, it's something that we're closely focused on. Two, we've taken measures in order to ensure that we have supply and can provide supply continuity. And then lastly, we also have the contingency plans should the situation deteriorate. Matt McGrew : Patrick, this is Matt. We did a kind of bottoms-up analysis plant by plant, company by company, even factoring in higher costs that we might see here over the winter into the next year. I mean this is a very, very manageable number. It's just not a big number. Patrick Dolly : Okay. That's good to hear. And then maybe just a follow-up on Luke's instrument question. I guess just kind of wondering in terms of the visibility you guys have. I know the backlog has been elevated. Order growth has been really strong, particularly on SCIEX. There's kind of this -- is there a pull forward? Is there not? Maybe just talk a little bit about, again, the visibility you have, what the backlog looks like currently and just how durable some of that instrument strength is it's been elevated for a while now. So just trying to get a handle on the comfort level of the strength there? Rainer Blair : So as you suggest, the backlog is elevated. That is due to two factors. The strong demand that I referenced earlier, that's really broad-based, pharma, academic, and so forth. But also because there has been, over the last 18 months, some supply constraints around electronic components. So we see demand remaining strong across the board for all these research applications that I referenced. And as a result of that, we also see that in our order rates and backlog position, not just here for Q4 but also going into '23. Operator : It appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. John Bedford : Thanks, Shelby. We're around all day for questions and follow-ups. Have a good rest of the day. Rainer Blair : Thanks everyone. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Our terrific fourth quarter results rounded out another great year for Danaher. Broad-based strength across the portfolio drove nearly 10% core growth, strong earnings growth and free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the performance of our base business, which grew high single digits for the year and has now grown high single digits or better each of the last 10 quarters.  Our well-rounded results this year would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 80,000 associates. The team overcame global supply chain challenges, logistics delays, COVID-driven lockdowns and inflationary pressures to reliably support our customers. We believe the DBS-driven execution, coupled with our proactive growth investments over the last several years contributed to meaningful market share gains in many of our businesses. Now looking to 2023 and beyond, we see a bright future ahead for Danaher. Our portfolio is made up of leading franchises of durable business models and attractive end markets that benefit from outstanding long-term secular growth drivers. We're well positioned financially with our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet capacity, allowing us to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. So this unique combination of leading businesses and financial strength all powered by the Danaher Business System differentiates us and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage. So with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2022 financial results. For the full year, we delivered nearly 10% core revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth, including 8% core revenue growth in our base business. We also expanded our core operating margins by 60 basis points and generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio exceeded 100% for the 31st consecutive year. Our strong financial results allowed us to continue our cadence of high impact growth investments throughout the year. In fact, our investments in research and development of more than $1.7 billion in 2022 enabled us to accelerate innovation across Danaher. New products such as the Leica Microsystems, Beacon, Leica Biosystems automated advanced staining platform, Bond Prime; and Hach's Headquarter series portable meters are helping improve both human health and the environment, while enhancing our growth trajectory.  Our capital expenditures of over $1 billion included substantial investments to expand production capacity in our bioprocessing and genomics businesses. These investments have been critical to support current customer demand but they're equally important to support the long-term growth opportunities and security of supply in these markets. With several of our customers' biologic therapies progressing through the regulatory approval process, we anticipate the size of our bioprocessing and genomics businesses to increase meaningfully here in the coming years. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results in more detail. Sales were $8.4 billion, and we delivered 7.5% core revenue growth. Our base business core revenue growth was also 7.5% as our core revenue growth contribution from COVID-19 testing was neutral year-over-year. Geographically, core revenue growth in both North America and Western Europe was approximately 10%. We saw healthy demand across our major end markets with customer activity and funding levels largely consistent with the third quarter. High-growth markets core revenue was up slightly. China grew low single digits, driven by robust demand in our life sciences instruments and acute care diagnostic businesses. However, the reopening efforts associated with the ending of zero COVID policies and subsequent increase in COVID-19 infections resulted in reduced patients and testing volumes in our clinical diagnostics business. We anticipate lower testing volumes to continue through the first quarter of 2023 before gradually recovering through the balance of the year. Our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 59%, and our operating margin of 27.4% was up 100 basis points, including 105 basis points of core operating margin expansion. This strong margin performance was enabled by the disciplined cost management, productivity measures and price actions our teams implemented to help offset the impact of inflationary pressures across our business. While there continue to be supply chain disruptions and cost pressures, we saw a modest improvement in component availability again this year and this quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.87 was up 6.5% versus last year, and we also generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to point out some updates we've made in our financial reporting. Due to changes in our organization resulting from the significant growth of our Life Sciences segment over the past several years, we have separated our former Life Science segment into two new reporting segments. Cytiva and Pall Life Sciences, which include bioprocessing and our discovery and medical businesses are now reported as the biotechnology segment. Our new life sciences segment is comprised of the remainder of the businesses in our former life sciences segment. The Diagnostics and Environmental & Applied Solutions segments are unchanged. Importantly, today's discussion reflects these changes. So now let's take a look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 1% and core revenue was up 4%. In bioprocessing, robust customer activity across monoclonal antibodies, cell and gene therapies and antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, drove another quarter of more than 20% growth in non-COVID revenue.  Total core growth in bioprocessing was mid-single digits for the fourth quarter as customers continue to scale back their COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic programs. For the full year 2022, core revenue growth in bioprocessing was high single digits, which included non-COVID revenue growth of more than 20%. Looking to 2023, we expect customers to further reduce their COVID-19-related programs. Vaccination and booster rates have been significantly lower than initially anticipated and the availability of alternative therapeutics has reduced the need for monoclonal antibody-based treatment. In light of these dynamics, we now anticipate COVID-19-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue will be approximately $150 million for the full year of 2023, down from approximately $800 million in 2022 and lower than our previous expectation of $500 million. Our non-COVID business has averaged more than 20% growth over the past two years. Given these elevated growth rates, we spent the past several weeks speaking with our customers to better understand their planning assumptions for 2023. And based on these discussions, we anticipate non-COVID bioprocessing core growth will be high single digits for the full year 2023. This includes low single-digit core growth in the first quarter as customers repurpose inventory purchased for COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic programs to non-COVID projects. Now there is a bright future ahead for the biologics market and our leading bioprocessing business. The number of biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise, and we expect to see significant industry-wide investments in research, development and production capacity well into the future. With our differentiated portfolio, which is the broadest and deepest in the industry across upstream and downstream applications, our best-in-class scientific services and extensive global reach, we're exceptionally well positioned to support our customers as they undertake this complex life-changing work. Now moving to our Life Sciences segment. Reported revenue grew 8%, and core revenue was up 13%. Strength was broad-based across instruments and consumables with all major businesses delivering high single-digit or better core revenue growth. Our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively delivered double-digit base business core revenue growth, led by Leica Microsystems and Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Demand remains solid across our major geographies and end markets, and we're seeing good momentum in our opportunity funnels as we begin the new year. Our genomics consumables businesses had another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, driven by strong demand for our plasmas, RNA and gene lighting and editing solutions. During the quarter, IDT strengthened its next-generation sequencing portfolio with the acquisition of Archer DX NGS assays. These assays are foundational in researching novel cancer fusions and bring new capabilities, including an enhanced bioinformatics platform to expand IDT's suite of sequencing solutions. Now moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue was up 3% and core revenue grew 7.5%, led by mid-teens growth at Cepheid. Radiometer grew double digits, led primarily by demand for blood gas testing in China. Leica Biosystems was also up double digits with growth across all major product lines. In our digital pathology business, we saw record placements of the GT 450, Leica's best-in-class digital pathology slide scanner, as customers are increasingly realizing the operational and clinical benefits of digitization. In Molecular Diagnostics, core revenue across Cepheid's non-respiratory chest menu grew more than 20% led by infectious disease testing, sexual health and hospital-acquired infections. The acceleration in growth this quarter was due in part to increased adoption of Cepheid's non-respiratory test menu across our nearly 50,000 instruments installed base, which has doubled since 2020. During the quarter, Cepheid expanded their competitively advantaged test menu with the launch of the Xpert Express MVP. The Express MVP rapidly diagnoses three distinct health conditions that cause overlapping vaginitis symptoms in women using a single sample. This addition to our sexual health portfolio enables physicians to quickly diagnose the patient's infection and prescribe a targeted treatment regimen, reducing the need for multiple office visits. Now this is a great example of how bringing accurate, easy-to-use molecular testing closer to patients is improving health care outcomes and driving long-term growth at Cepheid. In respiratory testing, global PCR testing volumes continued to moderate. The demand for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR testing remained robust. Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter significantly exceeded our expectation of approximately $375 million. The respiratory season got off to an earlier-than-anticipated start with a high prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses, notably COVID-19, flu and RSV leading to both higher volume and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A&B and RSV. Now based on discussions with our customers, we believe COVID-19 will enter an endemic disease state in 2023, and as a result, expect to ship 30 million respiratory tests and generate $1.2 billion of revenue for the full year. As hospitals and health systems begin planning for their endemic testing needs, we're increasingly seeing customers consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platforms on to Cepheid's GeneXpert. Our customers' preference for the GeneXpert for both respiratory and non-respiratory testing is a result of the significant value of the unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and a best-in-class workflow provide clinicians. The combination of these advantages, the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market and our leading global installed base creates significant opportunities ahead for Cepheid's point-of-care solutions. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 1% and core revenue was up 5.5%. Water quality core revenue growth was high single digits and product identification was flat. At product identification, marking and coding was up slightly while packaging and color management was down low single digits. Core revenue at Videojet was up slightly due in part to a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew low double digits in Q4 last year. In December, Pantone announced Viva Magenta as the 2023 Color of the Year. The color of the year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high single-digit full year core revenue growth in X-Rite [ph] color standards business in 2022. In water quality, Hach delivered their third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. ChemTreat was also up double digits in the fourth quarter, capping its 54th consecutive year of growth, a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class execution and their commitment to continuous improvement. During the quarter, demand for analytical chemistries and consumables remained strong across municipal and industrial end markets, but we did see a slight moderation of larger project activity at Trojan. Throughout the year, our teams and EAS did a great job leveraging the Danaher Business System to overcome supply chain challenges and manage inflationary pressures. They were at the forefront of identifying potential constraints and quickly deployed DBS tools like daily management to work with suppliers and ensure production part availability. They also use visual project management to rapidly reengineer products and to reduce our reliance on hard-to-source electronic components. Also, strong price performance helped the team expand operating profit margins by more than 80 basis points in 2022, while continuing their cadence of growth investments. We believe this outstanding execution paired with our proactive growth investments drove market share gains and enhanced our long-term competitive advantage in both product identification and water quality. So with that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and the full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we are updating our base business core revenue growth definition to exclude the impact of COVID-19-related testing and the impact of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenue.  In the first quarter, we expect core revenue growth in our base business to be up mid-single digits. We also expect total core revenue growth to decline mid-single digits as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%. Now for the full year 2023. We expect high single-digit core growth in our base business. And we also expect total core revenue growth to decline mid-single digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 31%. So to wrap up, 2022 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to reliably support our customers and deliver outstanding financial results, all while investing for the future. As we look ahead, we believe the combination of our talented team, differentiated portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, position Danaher to outperform well into the future. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to John. John Bedford : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Todd, we're now ready to open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hey, good morning. And thank you for taking my question. So, a couple of questions to start. I guess the first one would be just on the inventory situation and sort of like how we should think about that working through and just sort of your expectations on the bioprocessing front on the non-COVID bioprocessing. Just some sense of timing. Is this a 1Q, 2Q phenomenon? Just general thoughts there. Rainer Blair : Derik, as it relates to the inventory situation, let's think about sort of our Q1 guide here as a starting point and the context for that. We expect for our overall guide to have a base business growth of mid-single digits, and we expect COVID testing, including now vaccine and therapeutics to have high single-digit and low double-digit headwind, giving us that decline of mid-single digits in the first quarter. Now let me come back to the base business because, of course, that's where your question resides. And once more, we have to be clear that we have now excluded vaccine and therapeutic revenues from the base business, right? So our mid-single-digit base business is down from the comparable low double-digit core growth we saw in Q4 and most of 2022. And that's due mainly to bioprocessing, ex-COVID, and I want to dig into that a little bit, but also because we're expecting lower patient volumes here in China as zero COVID policies are ended. So that's what's happening there in that base business in Q1. Now if we look, and we dig in a little bit deeper into bioprocessing, we anticipate that our non-COVID bioprocessing business will be low single digits, and that's really for two reasons. One, we're coming off of 30% growth in Q1 of 2022. But we're also working through the inventory pockets that we spoke about that was related primarily to COVID programs. And we do expect Q1 to be an inflection point there that we work through the majority of that in Q1 and then after that, continue to see improvement. Derik De Bruin : Got it. Okay. And I have to ask the obligatory analytical instrumentation demand, SCIEX demand coming off of some really strong growth this year. What are your sort of expectations on instruments? And I would expect you would see some slowdown in the back half of the year is embedded in your numbers. Rainer Blair : I think that reflects our perspective. We saw low double-digit plus core growth in our instrument businesses here in 2022 and believe that we definitely took share there. And frankly our funnels are still very strong here going into the new year. But as we look to the total year, we would expect that low double-digit plus to moderate to the more normal growth of mid-single digit plus certainly towards the back end of the year. Derik De Bruin : And what's embedded in sort of like an overall pricing expectation just to get your sense of... Rainer Blair : So as you know, in the fourth quarter on pricing, Derik, we came in over 400 basis points, with the teams really executing very well. And that represents roughly where we were for all of 2022. As we look forward then into 2023, we continue to expect some cost pressures there, and we'll look to have pricing of 200 to 300 basis points, probably closer to 300 basis points. Matthew McGrew : Derik, that's for total Danaher, not just instruments. Derik De Bruin : Yes. Okay. Got it. Got it. Like that. Okay. I think I'll get back in the queue. I've got some other ones where I need to digest some stuff, but thank you. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Derik. Operator : Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Rachel. Rachel Vatnsdal : Good morning. So first up, just on China. So you mentioned that you're expecting some softness there. Can you just dig a little bit deeper, how much of the softness on that 1Q is going to be pressured there? And then what do you expect for China in total for the year as well? Thanks. Rainer Blair : So as I mentioned, China is -- and of course, everybody knows coming out of the zero COVID lockdowns and that's affecting patient volumes here. And we saw that in December, in particular, and have taken that as an indicator for how we should think about the first quarter in China, which we expect to be down around high single digits here in the first quarter, but then moderating as the Chinese population gets through sort of the various infection waves that are expected. And we expect that patient volumes then improve throughout the year and are expecting low single digits for the full year in China. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. You mentioned that Western Europe was 10% core during 4Q. Can you just talk about your expectations for Europe with this year? Have you seen any softness related to any budget constraints on your conversations with customers there? Thanks. Rainer Blair : I would tell you, if we think about non-COVID, we continue to see good demand in Western Europe. We have seen the cycle time of deals. So that period of time between lead, capture and capturing the order extending here in the fourth quarter, and we would expect that to continue. As you think about Western Europe, including COVID headwinds, we would expect that to be flat here in the first quarter and then up low single digits. But once again, that includes some COVID headwinds. Rachel Vatnsdal : Helpful. And then final question for me, just around bioprocessing. Can you just walk us through kind of the order book and how book-to-bill has trended within bioprocessing given some of the puts and takes there getting us to that low single digits in the first quarter and rounding out the year at high single digits on the non-COVID side? Rainer Blair : Sure. So as it relates to orders, and I talked about this in the past as well as book-to-bill. In fact, we don't really look at book-to-bill for the bioprocessing business because it may not be the best way, and we don't think it is the best way to really understand the underlying health of the business, particularly given the extended lead times that we had here in the prior period. So we've been looking at orders really on a two to three-year horizon to take out the lumpiness as well as the extended lead times. And over the last three years, really, both orders and revenues have grown at a mid-single teens average rate. Now from a current trend perspective, in the fourth quarter, our order rate improved by over 500 basis points sequentially but was still down mid-teens, which was as expected as customers continue to adjust for our shorter lead times. Now to be clear, our full year 2023 guide anticipates Q1 being the low point at low single digits for the bioprocessing non-COVID core growth. And that also takes account to any inventories that might be with some of our COVID program customers, which are now being repurposed. We're working with those customers to repurpose that inventory. So whatever these order dynamics are revenue forecast for bioprocessing non-COVID in first quarter low single digits, we expect that to be the low point of the inventory work off or burn off and then move forward to what is high single-digit bioprocessing, non-COVID core growth for the full year. Rachel Vatnsdal : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Good morning, Rainer. Thanks for taking my question. So I had my first question on bioprocessing here just about clarify some of these numbers here. I think a couple of months ago, Rainer, I think the expectation was for base bioprocessing, anywhere from high singles to teens. When you look at the high single, if it's at the low end of the range, did anything change? And when I think about that cadence throughout the year, I think first half is somewhere in the mid-single digits imply second half and double-digit range. Is there any risk out there in the back half? What gives you the visibility in the back half activation [ph] bioprocessing? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Vijay. So as early as the JPMorgan conference, we did talk about the bioprocessing growth range being from high single digits to mid-teens range. And as I mentioned then, and I'll confirm now, we have spent the last several weeks talking to our customers to understand their planning assumptions for the year. And the clear message is the underlying demand remains robust and unchanged. So we continue to see monoclonal antibodies, cell therapy and gene therapy activity continue to be strong, and we're even seeing more work on mRNA on the back of its success with COVID vaccine. So while the demand is remaining solid, customers are actually not anticipating a step-up in activity. So activity remains strong and as we've seen in prior quarters, but they're not anticipating a step-up versus what we've seen here in the last couple of years. And so as you look at the two, three, even four year stacks here, we've seen mid-teens growth CAGRs for bioprocessing non-COVID. So coming back then, if you take our high single-digit bioprocessing non-COVID full year guide on the back of an approximately 30% comp from 2022, it's right in the mid-teens range, both on a two and a three-year basis. So we think that's especially strong in light of the fact that in Q1, we do expect to burn off some inventory and will start low single digits. And in fact, if we had assumed the mid-teens to the higher part of the range for '23, that actually would have implied an acceleration of demand to over 20% on a two-year stack. And frankly, that's just not supported by our customer discussions.  So as we think about burning off these inventories, you asked about the confidence in the later part of the year, and that confidence is based on our discussions with customers, the backlog that we have, the continued order activity that we see and that has improved over prior periods. And so we feel very good about the high single digits non-COVID bioprocessing growth for 2023. Matthew McGrew : And maybe, Vijay, just to give you a bit -- sorry, yes. Just to give you kind of numbers to it because I know we've talked about this a lot recently, just so that we kind of repeated here. If you look at bioprocessing, ex-COVID growth, right, over the last four years, inclusive of our '23 guide, you have 7%, 8% type growth in 2020 as we are sort of moving into and away from the core bioprocessing doing more COVID work. And then in 2021 and 2022, we grew, ex-COVID, 20% plus in each of those two years. And so now this year in '23, the high single-digit guide, it's sort of kind of an inverse barbell, if you will. But if you look at kind of high single digits to start in '20, high single digits as we get through the last of COVID in '23 with 20% and 25% growth in the middle in '21 and '22, that's sort of the period that we're looking back and over because I don't think you can look at just any one period or quarter, given everything Rainer said that happened in '21 and '22 with the extended lead times and what was happening with COVID. So just so that we're all on the same page on sort of the numbers historically on how we have sort of arrived at that mid-teens growth rate in discussion with our customers who say, Hey, look, if you look back over the last three, four years, my demand is about the same. My order pattern is going to be slightly different, but my end demand is about the same. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful color and perspective. And then one last question here for me, perhaps, Matt, this is you. The high single-digit guide for bioprocessing implies like the non-bioprocessing that's nearly 75% of Danaher revenues. That's also up high singles. That's a strong number. Again, any confidence here? I think there's been some concerns around capital order trends. So what's the order book shaping up for instruments? And margins here, 31% that's stepped down from Q4. Given that high single digits will resume and the pricing commentary, your volume leverage and pricing contribution should be pretty strong. So maybe if you could just comment on the non-bioprocessing high single-digit assumptions and margin assumptions? Matthew McGrew : Let me take margins. And I think we sort of covered the high-single digits bit, but maybe Rainer can kind of wrap it up on bioprocessing. Vijay Kumar : I'm sorry, non-bioprocessing, non-bioprocessing. Matthew McGrew : Non-bioprocessing. I'm sorry. So COVID? Vijay Kumar : No, no. Ex-bioprocessing, the other EAS diagnostics. I mean... Matthew McGrew : I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Everything outside of bioprocessing. Got you. So let me start with the margin question first because I think that's one that's topical here, too. So if you think about margins for the full year, and then I can kind of touch on '21 or Q1 as well. When you look at margins, we're talking about kind of 31% adjusted margin. And that's going to be a bit lower than we were in '23 on the margin, if you will, with the biggest factor going to be the value of leverage, like you alluded to there. We're going to lose, call it, $3.2 billion of COVID headwinds in the year, $700 million from the vaccines and therapeutics as we go from, call it, $800 million to a little over $150 million or a little under $150 million. And then we're going to have $2.5 billion of testing follow-up as we think we get to a more endemic state on Cepheid testing. So the margin profile on that stuff on the headwinds is basically the fleet average. I'd say that probably falls through at 40%. So kind of in line with our normal fall through, but that volume is pretty meaningful at $3.2 billion as you talked about. So we will offset some of that. High single-digit core and base business is going to be $1.7 billion in change, let's call it, falling through 35% to 40%, but just not enough to fully compensate what's happening with our COVID headwinds here.  So I think you combine that the volume with sort of an overall macro backdrop, Vijay, that I still want to kind of be prudent here from a planning perspective as we head into the year. I want to see how the inflation of the supply chain kind of progresses through the year. China is still a bit of an unknown on how that bounces back. And I kind of I like to start the year with cost structure that's in the right place, and let's see how some of these things sort of play out. And as the year goes on, we'll obviously try to do better, but that's sort of how I'm kind of thinking about the margin for the year. And really, the only difference between Q1 and Q2 from 31% for the full year -- I'm sorry, in Q1, is FX in the first quarter. That's it. We'll have a $225 million FX headwind in Q1. And so, I would say that the same drivers, if you will, for the full year are for Q1. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful. Rainer Blair : And then Vijay, just coming back to your question regarding the base business without Biotechnology growth here for 2023. We talked about Life Sciences instruments going from the low double digits or to the mid-single-digit plus here as we expect that to moderate during the course of the year. But in our Life Science businesses, we also have our genomics businesses, which are growing at double digits. So when you look at our under the new definition, Life Sciences business, so that would be the instrument businesses and genomics businesses, we expect high single-digit growth for the year. As it relates to our Diagnostics business, without COVID testing, we also expect high single-digit growth there, if you think about the growth in Leica Biosystems, Radiometer and as patient volumes normalize, supported also by solid growth at Beckman diagnostics, once again without COVID testing high single digits. And then as it relates to EAS, we would expect that now to normalize after having had just banner growth here in the last couple of years to be more the low to mid-single-digit growth, probably skewed more to mid-single digits for the year. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s extremely helpful, Rainer. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Lots of detail already discussed here, so I'll try to go back to a little bigger picture. What assumptions are you guys using for kind of labor and material inflation for 2023? I assume this is mitigated a little bit from the high labor inflation you've had the last couple of years, but curious on your view there? Matthew McGrew : Yes, Scott. I think when I think about price cost, kind of back to that 200 to 300 basis points of price, we have been positive on price/cost the last, I guess, year here and probably a little bit more. So I think we -- that guide of 200 to 300 basis points would keep us at positive price cost. We are seeing -- I would say that we're seeing some things from a supply chain pressure come down. Freight lanes is probably the one the biggest one that I can think of from a cost perspective. I would tell you that other parts of the supply chain, we probably are seeing availability be better but not necessarily seeing costs come down yet. So I think we're sort of still in that 200 to 300 basis points of price to help offset what is still out there, but there are early signs of things may be turning. Scott Davis : Is that price, Matt, is that pretty much already out in the system? Or is that still to be... Matthew McGrew : No. No, it's out. Yes, it's already out there. If we need to if we need to -- we can go for more as we've done here, Scott, and you saw that as we built through the year this year. Scott Davis : And can you guys remind us what are the remaining steps you need for the EAS separation? Is there any kind of upside to getting that done on the earlier than planned? Matthew McGrew : I'd love to say that it's easy to do, but there's quite a bit of work to get through it, Scott. I mean we've got -- we're still in the early days of the audits, getting the audits done. And after that, we've got a lot of org work, obviously, to do and a whole work stream of people who are working on it. I think we are still very much on track for Q4, the ability to do something here in Q4. Anything earlier, I think just between the audits, the work that remains and the tax ruling, it just takes time for these. So I don't think that's probably a base case scenario for us right now, Scott. I still think Q4 is the way to think about it. Scott Davis : Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you, guys and best of luck in '23. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Brennan with Cowen. Dan Brennan : Great. Good morning, Rainer, good morning, Matt. Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe first one would just be on China. I know there was a question asked earlier, but just wondering, some peers have commented that obviously, there's a headwind right now as the COVID rates have spiked but that as the year plays out, you could see China actually turned out to be stronger than maybe you were -- than peers were anticipating, excuse me, given the benefits on the economy. So kind of what are you assuming in that low single? Is that -- do you think you need some cushion in there? Or just how do you contemplate China playing out for the year given the change of policy? Rainer Blair : Dan, so -- I mean, the near term, just to recap is, in fact, that we saw, particularly in our Diagnostics business, lower patient volumes related to the hospitals in China being overwhelmed with COVID-infected patients. And we expect that to continue here in the Q1. It's currently the Lunar New Year holiday, where we expect infections to spread here in the next 30 days or so. And then over time, that, that would start waning, reducing. With -- it's kind of unknown as to how many other waves follow that. But we do believe that during the course of the year, especially as it relates to our business, patient volumes start recovering. We've seen this again and again after severe lockdowns of large cities in the previous years. And so we expect that to be pretty resilient. And that's why we end up then with a full year China guide of low single digits. Now could there be upside? Potentially. There's clearly some pent-up demand in the Chinese economy. And it just depends now on how quickly people can get back to work and some normalcy returns to the markets in general. So we think from where we sit today, low single digits for the full year is a good way to think about it. And of course, we'll continue to update as we go through the year here. But it's a good starting point, and there may be some upside should in fact that pent-up demand be released here in 2023. Dan Brennan : Great. And then just on the M&A environment. We've heard some commentary in kind of recent weeks that there seems to be a more willing seller environment, maybe just a reflection of macro and interest rates. So there seems to be maybe more folks coming to the table. How would you characterize obviously, it's impossible to time M&A, but how would you characterize the current environment? And just any color in terms of the outlook, whether it be from private targets or public targets and obviously, I'm sure all the remaining businesses post the EAS spin, EAS and excuse me, are candidates for M&A, but just how would you characterize kind of the interest levels by your business? Thank you. Rainer Blair : So our perspective on M&A remains unchanged here. First of all, our funnels continue to be very active. As you know, our balance sheet, which is now at 1.5 turns is in great shape. We're starting to see in the marketplace some recognition and I'll even say some acceptance of the lower valuation levels that we have now seen for a good period of time. And I would say it is early days, but the environment for M&A continues to improve. And as you know, in the past, when there have been these kind of situations, Danaher has been able to deploy capital in a really value-creating way. And of course, it's our intention to do that here in the future as well. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks, Rainer, thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question -- I'm sorry, our last question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Good morning, Rainer. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one on -- back to the Diagnostics business. On Cepheid, can you just talk about the non-COVID piece, what you're hearing customers in terms of utilization, usage, particularly those who bought instruments during COVID? Obviously, you saw the installed base double over a couple of years there. Would love just some perspective in terms of what you're seeing as COVID comes down a bit, respiratory comes down here shortly, what the expectations there are? Rainer Blair : I mean, Patrick, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. As you mentioned, over 50,000 instruments placed, more than double than we've had; well into the mid-20s in the number of tests. Now as you can imagine here in the fourth quarter and sort of the beginning of the first quarter, our customers have been busy with respiratory testing. No question about that. But we're very encouraged by the fact that even in the fourth quarter, we saw that non-COVID testing growing at over 20%. And I think that's indicative of a couple of things. First of all, we were very strategic in how we thought about placing our instrument in the sense that we really stayed at the point of care with customers that would be able to standardize their larger IDNs around the GeneXpert architecture as well as leverage subsequent to the pandemic, the broad testing menu that we offer, and we continue to see that. Not only do we continue to see that, but we see continued consolidation of point-of-care molecular testing onto the GeneXpert platform, which is likely also another driver for us seeing the continued adoption of the non-respiratory menu. So very positive outlook here. We're encouraged and its still kind of early days. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on Dan's capital deployment one there. Can you just refresh us on kind of how you think about leverage ratios and if the current rate environment changes your perspective at all in terms of what size deal you guys would look at? Matthew McGrew : Yes, Patrick. Yes, I mean from a leverage perspective, we've been, I think, a couple of times in our history, we got to a little bit over four. So -- I mean, I think we've always said we don't have much of an appetite to be rated any lower than we are, for sure. So I think that's sort of the outer boundaries of what kind of think about. But we kind of -- we've been all over the place historically. We don't really have a target of two or three. It just sort of moves around with the deal activity, and we sort of take our time to it. And as far as the current rate environment, I don't think it changes it for us. I think we still think about sort of returns in the same way that we did. We've been doing this a long time. We've been in rate environments like this before. We've been in the rate environments that are worse. Last 10 or 12 years, obviously, had at close to zero was a very different time, but I don't think we have fundamentally any changes here given where we're at. Patrick Donnelly : Alright. Thanks, Matt, thanks, Rainer. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks. Rainer Blair : Well, first of all, thanks again, everybody. We are thrilled with the way we closed out 2022, and we see a strong 2023 ahead with all the numbers, maybe just a quick recap. For 2023, we see our base business growing at high single digits. And in the first quarter, we see that base business despite the fact that we're working off some biotech and bioprocessing inventories at mid-single digits.  Now we've talked at length about COVID testing and vaccine, therapeutic headwinds and I think those are real. But despite those headwinds, we feel great about the important role that we played in the pandemic. Keep in mind, we have reinvested COVID-related cash flows to create lasting annuities with acquisitions and breakthrough innovation while further strengthening our balance sheet. And so, we exit the pandemic much stronger than we entered with higher growth and higher margins in our base business. So with that, we thank you for the call. Wish you all the best for 2023. John Bedford : Thanks, everybody. We're around for follow-ups all day. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation\u2019s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference. John Bedford : Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today\u2019s call and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until May 9, 2023. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to the first quarter of 2023 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our SEC filings and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Thank you, John and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. So we had a good start to the year. Our team successfully navigated a dynamic operating environment to deliver better-than-expected revenue earnings and cash flow. We are especially pleased with the strength of our base business, which grew 6% in the first quarter. Now across the portfolio, the quarter progressed largely as we anticipated. Our global supply chain has stabilized and component availability improved sequentially. Strong price realization helped offset inflationary pressures and disciplined cost management enabled us to continue our cadence of growth investments. So we believe these investments paired with DBS-driven execution contributed to market share gains in many of our businesses again this quarter. A prime example of the power of DBS and our commitment to continuous improvement at all levels of Danaher as the CEO Kaizen, which we kicked off 2 weeks ago. With this event, our most senior leaders are joining over 700 associates at 10 of our operating companies. We are focusing on the most significant opportunities for lasting competitive advantage across our businesses, including further reducing our best-in-class lead times at Aldevron and improving resin and filter throughput in the biotechnology group. The CEO Kaizen is just another terrific opportunity for our teams to come together and drive transformative change through DBS. In fact, once we wrap up here today, I will be joining the Cytiva team at our resin facility in Uppsala, Sweden, to contribute to these efforts. Now our results also reflect the unique positioning of Danaher\u2019s portfolio. We just have an exceptional group of leading franchises serving attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers. Additionally, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with the optionality to enhance our businesses both organically and through disciplined M&A. This powerful combination of our talented team, leading portfolio and strong financial position, differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage. So with that, let\u2019s turn to our first quarter results. Sales were $7.2 billion in the first quarter and core revenue declined 4%. So as I mentioned earlier, we delivered 6% core revenue growth in our base business with three of our four reporting segments, up high single-digits or better in the quarter. COVID-19 revenues were a headwind of approximately 10%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined mid single-digits, primarily as a result of lower COVID-19 revenues. High-growth markets were up low single-digits, with a low single-digit decline in China. Results in China were better than expected driven by a quicker-than-anticipated recovery in diagnostic testing and a more favorable life science research funding environment. We expect these positive trends to continue as we move through the year. Our gross profit margin for the first quarter was 61%. Our operating margin of 25% was down 330 basis points primarily due to the impact of lower COVID volume in our biotechnology and diagnostics businesses. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.36 and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we are seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 16% and core revenue was down 13%. In bioprocessing, base business core revenue growth was in line with our expectations of low single-digits in the first quarter. Flying demand at our large customers, were primarily responsible for therapies in commercial production and later-stage clinical trials remains robust and they are steadily working through inventory they built during the pandemic. Based on our most recent customer conversations, we now expect the inventory normalization process to continue through the second half of the year. During the quarter, we also saw softer demand globally at many of our emerging biotech customers as more pronounced pressures on liquidity and funding accelerated their efforts to conserve capital leading to project delays and cancellations. In consideration of these factors, we anticipate second quarter and full year base business core growth in bioprocessing will be largely consistent with the first quarter. That said these short-term pandemic-related dislocations have not changed our assessment of the tremendous opportunity ahead in the biologics market and for our leading bioprocessing franchise. The number of biologic and genomic medicines in development is meaningfully higher than at any point in history. In fact, there are thousands of biologic therapies currently under development, including more than 750 in Phase 3 clinical trials. With these therapies, our customers are making significant strides in addressing diseases that affect large segments of the population. For example, GLP-1s have become blockbuster treatment for obesity and diabetes and antibody drug conjugates are meaningfully improving treatment outcomes for many types of cancer. And we are also seeing promising developments in the field of Alzheimer\u2019s research where several novel monoclonal antibodies are nearing regulatory approval. Now to best support our customers as they pursue these life-changing breakthroughs, our biotechnology team has been accelerating investments and innovation over the last several years. Cytiva recently introduced the MabSelect VL, a new resin and ligand for bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments. The MabSelect VL\u2019s best-in-class finding capacity and improved alkaline stability makes industrial scale purification more efficient, helping customers improve yields, decrease bioburden and reduced manufacturing costs. This is just one of the innovative solutions from our biotechnology team\u2019s project pipeline aimed at helping customers bring more life-saving therapies to market faster and more efficiently. Turning to our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 2.5% and core revenue was up 5%, including high single-digit growth in our base business. Our Life Sciences instruments businesses collectively delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth, consistent with our expectations. Funding levels and sales funnels remained healthy across most major geographies and end markets. The demand for our advanced solutions remains strong, notably for recent innovations such as the SCIEX ZenoTOF7600 and Leica Microsystems, Mica. Our genomics consumables business had another quarter of double-digit base business core revenue growth. Robust demand for plasmids, proteins and gene writing and editing solutions was partially offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and basic research. During the quarter, Aldevron brought together capabilities from Cytiva and Precision Nanosystems to create a streamlined offering for the development, production and release of mRNA drug substance and drug product. This new offering will be available to customers later this year and is a great example of how we are integrating solutions from across Danaher to create differentiated offerings and deliver even greater value to our customers. Moving to our Diagnostics segment, reported revenue declined 10% and core revenue declined 7.5% with double-digit growth in our base business, offset by lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes at CES. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth and saw healthy market volumes globally. At Radiometer, strong demand for blood gas testing in China drove double-digit core growth. Leica Biosystems grew mid single-digits, led by advanced staining and digital pathology. Strength across developed markets and China enabled Beckman Coulter Diagnostics to exceed expectations and deliver mid single-digit core growth. On Molecular Diagnostics, broad-based strength across Cepheid\u2019s test menu drove more than 30% core growth in non-respiratory testing. As our customers look for ways to capitalize on the workflow advantages, the Cepheid GeneXpert delivered for COVID-related testing, they are increasingly adding additional assays from our market leading test menu. This increased menu utilization by our customers helped drive more than 50% growth in infectious disease testing in the first quarter. We also saw good momentum for our recently introduced vaginitis panel, the Xpert Xpress MVP, which contributed to nearly 30% growth in sexual health testing. In COVID-related respiratory testing, customers continued transitioning high throughput testing to the point of care and consolidating their point-of-care PCO testing platforms onto the GeneXpert. As a result, Cepheid\u2019s respiratory testing revenue of approximately $550 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $450 million. This was driven both by higher volumes and the preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A and B and RSV. We continue to expect approximately $30 million respiratory tests and $1.2 billion of revenue for the full year. Cepheid\u2019s strong results are a testament to the significant value and unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow provides clinicians. Given Cepheid\u2019s leading global installed base and growing adoption of the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market, we are well positioned to help customers meet their testing needs and continue gaining market share for years to come. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 5% and core revenue was up 6.5%. Water quality core revenue grew low double-digits and product identification was up low single-digits. In water quality, Hach delivered their fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and ChemTreat was up double-digits for the eighth consecutive quarter. Strength was broad-based across both equipment and consumables, particularly in our industrial end markets. This performance highlights the resilience of the high-margin recurring revenue business model that make up water quality and the significant value our solutions provide in support of customers\u2019 day-to-day mission-critical water operations. At Product Identification, marking and coding was essentially flat, while packaging and color management was up low single-digits. Videojet was up low single-digits despite a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew high single-digits in Q1 last year. Our growth investments are driving a healthy cadence of new product innovation at Videojet. In fact, in March, the team released the 15 ADC continuous inkjet printer the industry\u2019s first dedicated soft pigmented solution. The 15 ADC uses soft pigmented inks to print codes with consistent quality, excellent contrast and strong durability to avoid degradation and fading during production runs, helping customers reduce production downtime. So this is the first of several new product introductions Videojet has planned for the year and is a great example of how our teams are bringing impactful solutions to our customers. In February, we announced that our environmental and applied segment will be named Veralto, when it is launched as a stand-alone company and that it will be headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. This is an exciting milestone for the team, and they are making considerable progress towards becoming a separately traded public company. And we remain on track for our fourth quarter 2023 separation and look forward to sharing more details in the coming months. So now let\u2019s briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, we expect core revenue in our base business to be up mid-single digits. We also expect total core revenue to decline high single digits as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccine and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a second quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26% and which reflects efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID transitioning to an endemic state, particularly within our Diagnostics and Biotechnology businesses. Now turning to the full year 2023. Despite the near-term and temporary challenges within bioprocessing, we anticipate mid-single-digit core growth in our base business. We also expect total core revenue to decline high single digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30% and which reflects the previously mentioned efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID-19 transitioning to an endemic state. So to wrap up. We\u2019re pleased with our strong first quarter results. Our well-rounded performance is a testament to the durability and balanced positioning of our portfolio and our team\u2019s commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. While the transition of COVID-19 from a pandemic to an endemic state is causing near-term disruption, there is no doubt that the past 3 years have helped shake Danaher into a better, stronger company. We meaningfully changed the scale of our bioprocessing business, with the addition of Cytiva and the creation of the biotechnology group and Cepheid\u2019s expanded installed base that significantly improved their competitive advantage. We\u2019ve also increased our cadence of innovation and strategically deployed capital through M&A, including the acquisition of Aldevron to accelerate our future growth trajectory. So there is a bright future ahead for Danaher, the combination of our talented team, differentiated portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System provide us with a strong foundation to create value for many years to come. And so with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to John. John Bedford : Thank you, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Ashley, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Bedford : Good morning, Michael. Michael Ryskin : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. First, I want to start on the bioprocessing inventory challenges. You\u2019ve been dealing with this issue for almost a full year now and you\u2019ve had to revise your outlook lower for fiscal year \u201823 a number of times. Why is the visibility there into inventory is so challenging? And how do you know that this latest view of plus low single digits for the year is the right view and there is not further cuts going down the road? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Michael. Look, undoubtedly, visibility has been choppy here on the way up as COVID tailwinds fueled our growth. And now as we try to drive the soft landing visibility has been impacted. And I would tell you that normally, we have visibility of 9 to 12 months that\u2019s very solid. But it is so that in the last quarters, that has been probably more like 3 to 6 months related to a number of factors. And let me lay some of those factors out for you here, Michael. Sort of starting with the first quarter. So in the first quarter, our base business in bioprocessing grew about 100 basis points, 1%. And if you unpack the growth there, large accounts that are responsible for commercial production and later-stage clinical trials are growing at mid-single digits. So they are burning off inventory. And I\u2019ll come back to that. And then you have sort of emerging biotech and those companies that are more involved in discovery and earlier-stage clinical trial phases, which represent about 20% to 30% of our business and they are down mid-teens. So overall, this is what gets us to this sort of low single-digit growth view for the year. Now let me come back to the larger accounts here for just a second. We see in large biopharma that, in fact, the demand is there, the inventory is burning off, but it is slower than expected. And the reason for that is that we\u2019re starting to see larger pharma companies as well as larger CDMOs replan and recalibrate their own production plans as they start to conserve working capital and cash. And we saw some of that also back in 2016. So we\u2019re seeing larger customers also look at their own finished goods, if you will, inventories and starting to adjust their production plans in order to bring those down as well. So if you then transition over to, again, emerging biotech, so the companies that are working more in discovery and earlier stage. There \u2013 we have been observing funding headwinds for, call it, since the second half of the prior year. But those funding headwinds became significantly more pronounced here in the first quarter. And so we\u2019re seeing these accounts looking to conserve cash by prioritizing projects. We see that with lower OpEx and CapEx expenditures, also see a number of layoffs happening in that particular segment. And that\u2019s not just happening in the U.S. We also see that happening in China. And so we\u2019re assuming that barring any other sort of wildcards here, that it doesn\u2019t get significantly worse, but that this continues to play out for the remainder of the year. Matt McGrew : Mike, it\u2019s Matt. Maybe we could give you a little bit of kind of context around January to kind of the guide in January to where we ended up. I know Rainer sort of mentioned it, but I think it\u2019s important to kind of think about it in the two buckets. So we\u2019ve got the larger biotech \u2013 or the larger customers that we\u2019ve got, most of their stuff is sort of Phase 3 clinical on market. In January, our assumption was that, that was going to be kind of, call it, high single-digit growth from those customers. So 70% or so of our customers kind of growing at 7%, 8%. And then kind of the remaining 20%, 25% of the customers, which we\u2019re sort of referring to as emerging biotech, not everything in there is probably technically emerging, but that other piece of the customers in January, we thought that was going to kind of be about low double digits to kind of low teens growth. And you add all that up and that would have been the high single-digit growth that we thought we were going to see here for the year. Like Rainer said, what we saw in Q1 was just, frankly, not that supportive of that kind of ramp as we think about what we would need to build in Q1 and Q2 be able to hit those types of numbers for the full year. And so if you think about what we\u2019re looking at and seeing now in April, those large customers instead of being 7%, 8%, they have been growing still nicely, but more mid-single digits, right? And the big change here is this emerging biotech, another 20%, 25%. And instead of being up kind of mid-teens, they are actually down mid-teens and that comes back to everything that Rainer talked about with people really reprioritizing projects, conserving cash. That happened both in the U.S. and we saw it in China as well. And I think I\u2019d probably say it we saw modest headwinds as we entered the year. And those are just more pronounced now as we move through the quarter. So just as a \u2013 to maybe put some numbers to what Reiner said. Rainer Blair : And then just to reiterate, to support a significant second half ramp, we would start to see that activity level increasing now and in the second quarter. And we\u2019re just not seeing it to the degree that would support that. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Thanks. And on the emerging biotech, just really hope to clarify. Are you seeing that softness in bioprocessing specifically or across in the life sciences segment as well? And then maybe I could transition that to a question on the instrument. You saw 5% growth or mid-single-digit growth in instruments in the first quarter. What\u2019s your expectation for the rest of the year? Any particular pockets of weakness or strength you can call out? Matt McGrew : Yes, I\u2019ll comment on the bioprocessing broadly speaking, and maybe let Rainer talk about what we\u2019re seeing in tools. The answer is yes. We\u2019re seeing it in both. I would say that we have definitely seen the emerging biotech funding pressures here in the bioprocessing area. I would say we\u2019re seeing it in the tool space or in life sciences as well. I would say that is a lesser portion, obviously, of our revenue. So it\u2019s not quite as big of an impact. But are we seeing \u2013 yes, I would say we are seeing customers in those spaces conserving cash on both CapEx and OpEx. Michael Ryskin : Okay, thanks. Rainer Blair : So Michael, more generally on the Life Sciences here to your first question. So if we look at Q1, the life sciences based business finished as we thought at high single digits after low double-digit average growth over the last 3 years. And we\u2019ve talked previously about the expected normalization of those growth rates here after having seen that elevated growth for the last 3 years. So that\u2019s right within our expectations. If you look at that geographically, we saw strength in Western Europe and China, in fact, was up double digits on the back of some stimulus there. and North America was a little bit softer. And if you look at Life Sciences, from an end market perspective, large pharma R&D spending levels are still very quite healthy but they are starting to moderate just given the higher comps. And now just connecting the dots to Matt\u2019s commentary here, emerging biotech is impacted by the current funding environment, and we see smaller purchases, if you will, so rather than buying six, four instruments and in other places, really impacted in the less differentiated segments, let\u2019s say. So we are seeing in our own business is not as exposed to that segment in life sciences but we do see it at the margin. And then life science research and academic is holding up well globally for life sciences. So we continue to believe our growth rates moderate to the historical levels in \u201823, and that\u2019s what our value reflects. And that\u2019s not a change to any previous expectations. Michael Ryskin : Okay, thanks. I will get back in the queue. Rainer Blair : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on\u2026 Rainer Blair : Hi, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hi, Rainer. And congrats on a good start to the year. I guess, just a high-level question on the guidance here, Rainer. All of us are looking at \u2013 if I go back 2 months ago, we were assuming back half \u2013 perhaps normalization in the industry. And given your comments here on emerging small biotech, that\u2019s where it changes. Is this guidance now be risk because we\u2019re assuming bioprocessing in line with Q1. Are we confident that Q1 was a low point for the year? So just give us some color on the thought process behind the guidance here? I mean, is this now dearest from a back half perspective? Rainer Blair : So Vijay, I mean, we\u2019re basing our view on the second half. Also based on what we\u2019re seeing in the current market environment, which we just talked about as well as our order book. And like I said a minute ago, in order to support a higher guide for the second half, we need to see different activity levels here in Q1 and Q2. And that\u2019s not the case for two reasons. One, the emerging biotech is quite significantly softer, down mid-teens as we just talked about. And then I would say on the margin, larger accounts are taking a little bit more time to burn through inventory, although they are doing that nicely. And those factors together have us believe unless there is any other sort of significant market disruption that the year will play out much as the first quarter has. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then just one on \u2013 Cepheid was a bright spot here, 30% growth. I think you made some comments about infectious disease, different testing test being really strong. Can you give us some color on the customers are seeing this ramp? Are these new customers that bought a Cepheid system during the pandemic, I am just trying to think how sustainable is that 30% growth in sort of related one here on M&A, some chatter about Danaher on the M&A side. Would Danaher be interested in getting into services? Or how should \u2013 maybe just remind us on the M&A lens and criteria that Danaher processes that pipeline? Rainer Blair : Sure. So Vijay, on the Cepheid question, we\u2019re really seeing a broad-based usage of the infectious disease menu. In fact, our broader menu in general, both at our existing installed base that\u2019s been there for some time as well as with our newer customers as they start transitioning that COVID testing capacity that they have to take full advantage of that menu. So we see that 30% here as a good marker of how people appreciate the workflow advantages, the ease of use and the accuracy of the platform. Remember, we\u2019re seeing two factors here. One, we see test transitioning from high throughput environment into the point of care on the one hand. And on the other hand, we see expanded usage of our testing menu. Matt McGrew : Yes, Vijay, maybe just to kind of \u2013 to put a real-life example to that, I think. So if you think about what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019ve got customers \u2013 existing customers today, we kind of goes both ways, right? So we\u2019ve got existing customers today that, for example, will use Group A Strep. And those customers now sort of are also moving everything over to the four to one or to COVID as well. And then you\u2019ve got the other way, which is that sort of installed base going from kind of 2x growth here over the last 3 years. You have got people who have used these systems now for many, many years. And what they are doing is they are starting to bring in new menu and that new menu has been around infectious disease first, which is primarily right now, were largely Group A Strep. So, you are kind of having somebody who used the box throughout COVID testing, using it on for COVID four-and-one, and stand-alone. And now they are bringing on Group A Strep as well. And so that\u2019s what we always kind of talked about with COVID being an anchor assay as we go forward, larger installed base, anchor assay, now you move into infectious disease, there will be other opportunities to pull in sort of other menu as we go forward. But that\u2019s exactly the type of thing we are seeing play out here. And that\u2019s \u2013 it is encouraging. Early days yet, I mean and also still some lower base these are off of lower numbers. But as we go forward, we have sort of talked about next year and the longer term. That\u2019s why I think that installed base growth was so important because we have got the menu, be able to pull through and then the additions of the new menu are going to be only helpful on that larger installed base. Rainer Blair : So, on M&A, Vijay, obviously we don\u2019t comment on chatter. But what I would tell you is we really like the way we are positioned. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Valuations continue to moderate, perhaps the one or the other Board is not quite there yet, but we do see more realism in the many discussions that we have across the board as always. And specifically, as we have said in the past should our customers tag on this and on our help and services, that\u2019s not something that we are going to ignore. But once again, that\u2019s just one of several opportunities. I think the most important thing to remember is that we are not going to deviate from our disciplined approach. It\u2019s got to be the right end market. It\u2019s got to be the right target and the model has to work. And it\u2019s when those three lights flip green that we execute. Matt McGrew : Yes. I think Vijay, too, I mean I think as we sit here, I think it\u2019s \u2013 not saying this is \u201808, \u201809, but having a balance sheet that we have got right now and being able to kind of be flexible, I think is important in times like these because as Rainer said, when the market company valuation all line up, we are ready to go. But we do need to see all three of those. And as things get a little choppier here as they might get a little job here, I think I really like how we are kind of set up here from a balance sheet perspective as well. Vijay Kumar : Thanks Matt. Rainer Blair : Thanks Vijay. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning Scott. Scott Davis : Hey. Good morning guys. Rainer, Matt, and John good morning. Rainer, you have said \u2013 you made a reference in your prepared remarks to kind of incremental cost-out. I think I probably asked this question last quarter. But can you give us a little bit of granularity or color at least on what you are talking about? Is there a structural cost-out? Is it more of just taking out some of that \u2013 some of those kind of temporary costs that came in during COVID that now are unnecessary, or is there an actual attempt to go after some of the structural costs that perhaps you couldn\u2019t have gone after before? Matt McGrew : Yes. Scott, maybe I will take a crack at it. Yes, like we talked about in the prepared remarks, we are sort of going from an adjusted OP \u2013 adjusted operating margins of 31 in our previous guide to 30. And I think the way to think about it is sort of twofold, half of that is just the volume, right. Like \u2013 and most of that is all of that activities in bioprocessing. But the other half is capacity reduction costs. I would say that that\u2019s going to be two places. It\u2019s going to be in biotechnology and then as importantly, and more importantly, probably at Cepheid. Like you said, we have always sort of known we were going to get to an inflection point here at some point where we were sort of making the call that we have moved into an endemic phase. And once we moved into an endemic phase, we were going to need to bring some of the capacity that we have been running at it Cepheid down. And so I think just as a reminder, in Q4 last year, we did 20 million respiratory tests, and that was only three months ago. But I think you have really seen a tail off here as we have entered into the last couple of months. And I think our team is pretty clear that we are now kind of entering a new phase of volumes that we will need. And so we are going to be getting after some of that. And I think what does that look like, it\u2019s talking about closing and consolidating some of the plants that we have got. Some of those were frankly put up quickly in locations that were not ideal for the longer term because we are trying to meet the needs of a pandemic. So, we are going to get after a couple of those sites. We are going to reduce some of the headcount and then we are going to go after indirect and fixed overhead costs as well, reducing shifts, etcetera, etcetera. So, those are the types of things we are going to be going after here. That\u2019s largely going to be in the second quarter and third quarter is when you are going to see the costs sort of roll through. So, you will see that in the margin in those two quarters and then to sort of pop back a little bit. And then maybe just to give you some sense of what\u2019s that look like in \u2013 once we are done with that kind of in Q4 and as we head into \u201824, Scott, I think Cepheid in 2019 was a 20% to 25% OP business, during the peak of the pandemic here, it probably was north of 45%. And after we get through what we are going to do in the next couple of quarters, like I have said on the capacity reduction side, starting kind of in Q4 and heading into \u201824, they are going to be 35% to 40% margin, right. So, meaningfully up from where we were given the volumes that we have now, it\u2019s a much bigger business, but not quite at the peak pandemic where I was getting a lot of volume leverage, but that gives you a sense of what we are going after, what we are trying to do and where we end up on the other side. Scott Davis : That\u2019s super helpful, Matt. Can you guys just remind us what \u2013 where is your \u2013 the size of their installed base in Cepheid today versus pre-COVID, I know I have \u2013 I am sure having the note somewhere, but to just make a little easier on...? Matt McGrew : Yes. 2x, Scott, we are about 50,000 today. Started probably like 2019. Scott Davis : Alright. Perfect. I will pass it on. Thank you, guys. Good luck this year. Matt McGrew : Yes. Rainer Blair : Thanks Scott. Operator : We will take our next question from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning Dan. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for the questions guys. Maybe just one on bioprocess to start out, just \u2013 could you help us think through like what is the magnitude of that destock drag that\u2019s kind of baked in guidance? I know you gave a lot of color earlier in the Q&A. And then related to that, or emerging bio, it\u2019s certainly a bigger group than we thought as a percentage of that segment. Any color kind of what that grew in \u201822 and kind of the quick math to get to low single for the year? If it\u2019s 30% of revenues, I guess you are assuming some improvement there because if we kept it down 15%, I don\u2019t think we would get to up low single for the year. Matt McGrew : Yes. So, maybe \u2013 again, maybe the way to think about it, Dan, is that sort of the larger customers that are really where we are seeing the inventory drag. That was sort of \u2013 we initially thought we would see that in the high-single digits, call it, 7%, 8%, and that\u2019s a little bit lower now, call it, 6% and change. And so I think the inventory destocking is flowing through in the larger customers, and you are seeing it at a slightly lower growth rate that we saw in Q1 and we are expecting them to see for the full year. So, that\u2019s how I would sort of frame what the inventory destocking is. The rest is really, like I talked about earlier, emerging biotech and sort of the other 25% of our customers, we thought that, that would be a low teens type growth rate here for the year. Combine that with the 8% that we thought we would see in the larger, that\u2019s how we get to high-single digits. That low teens is actually negative mid-teens, right, with all the pressures we talked about. So, I would say that we are just sort of assuming that that type of growth rate for the rest of the year for that customer base and that we are going to have \u2013 the larger customers will be more in the mid-single digit like I talked about. That\u2019s what we are kind of assuming for the year. And based entirely on what we saw in Q1, the order book in Q1 sort of not being supportive, frankly, of, in our minds, at least, the ability with the limited visibility we have or more limited visibility, just not supportive of being able to say that we think we can get back to high-single digits. I think you asked a question of what those customers were there last year. That entire business largely was up in line with what we saw last year, which is as you remember, mid to high 20s. So, kind of you sort of look at mid to high-20s with that group of folks, now they are sort of down mid-teens, still a very solid growth on a 2-year basis, but it is what we are seeing right now. Dan Brennan : Got it. And then thanks Matt. And then may be on the margins and the earnings, so we are coming out somewhere kind of $925 million, $930 million for the year. Just wondering if you guys \u2013 you kind of put the pieces together. Is that kind of the rates of code? And given the cost actions you are taking this year, does that set yourself up in \u201824 for like potentially higher than normal operating leverage, depending on what the top line comes in at? Matt McGrew : Yes. No, I mean I think if you are going through the full year, the math is what it is at around 30% adjusted OP margins, I think sort of that takes care of itself. As far as what we are going to look like as we sort of get to the other side of this. I mean I talked a little bit about Cepheid kind of was 20% to 25% pre-pandemic, peaked up at 45% and 35% to 40%. I mean I think if you sort of use that frame plus what we have in diagnostics, that sort of gets you where we think roughly the margin profile will be. Biotech is probably the other one after we get through some of these costs. The same math there was biotech was, call it, high 30s prior to the pandemic. Again, it peaked at around, call it, 45% and change. And after we sort of get through what I think we are going to do there, they are probably going to be more like low-40s. So, again better than they were pre-pandemic given the fact that they are a bigger business. But those two pieces, I think you can slide into what \u201824 might look like. And then life sciences, that should be kind of plus or minus where we have been here. That has not been a margin that\u2019s moved around quite a bit. A little bit of COVID stuff as we had in \u201822 and \u201821, but I think you can kind of get a sense of what the margins are there. So, maybe it\u2019s just a high-level framework, you are probably high-30s, low-40s with Cepheid, you can kind of assume some other stuff for the diagnostics, biotech, probably low-40s than what we are seeing in LS. But we will obviously sort of come back to that later, still pretty early in \u201823, but just to give you a very high level view. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks Matt. Thanks guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks Dan. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning Jack. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good morning. Another question on bioprocessing. Can you share what was your total order rate in the quarter? Is there any color you can just share around how the quarter played out? Have things weakened throughout the quarter. Just curious about how things are trending. Rainer Blair : Sure, Jack. So, once again, first quarter, our orders were down modestly sequentially. So, relative to the fourth quarter, down modestly. But year-over-year, they declined 20%, okay. And so what we have been seeing is the inventory burn down that we have been talking about Matt and myself, is occurring, and we see that in our order book here for the first quarter. And then again, we have laid out why we believe that the current activity level supports sort of a similar progression of the quarters here throughout the year as we had in the first quarter. Jack Meehan : Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I was curious what impact, if any, did you see from the banking crisis, which took place in the quarter. I understand you probably didn\u2019t have any direct exposure to that, but how are your customers reacting sort of across the business? Rainer Blair : Right. So, direct exposure was not material in any sense of the word. As it relates to the impact on our businesses, particularly in bioprocessing, to a much lesser extent in life sciences, we do think that, that provides that additional inflection point here in the first quarter for liquidity tightening up and that prioritization that we are seeing here in the emerging biotech segment, call it emerging biotech, and once again, those companies working on earlier stage projects. So, that\u2019s where we have seen a more pronounced conservation of cash and that plays out in OpEx, CapEx and you can \u2013 and we talked about how that played out with mid-teens contraction as opposed to sort of a mid-teens growth versus prior periods. Jack Meehan : Thank you, Rainer. Rainer Blair : Thanks Jack. Operator : And we will take our final question from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning Rachel. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions you guys. And so I appreciate all the comments that you have given on emerging biotech softness in bioprocessing with that customer set really down mid-teens in 1Q. So first, just a clarifying question. Did you say that you expect that emerging biotech to remain at mid-teen declines for the year? And then kind of shifting more longer term, can you talk about your assumptions around when you expect emerging biotech to return to growth? And at what point can this funding issue really pressure the long-term growth outlook for the bioprocessing market? Rainer Blair : So, just to confirm on the topic of emerging biotech, our assumption is and our guide reflects that the activity level in emerging biotech stays for the remainder of the year as it played out in the first quarter. So, we are not assuming any change there including that it doesn\u2019t get significantly worse. Now, as it relates to how that segment progresses here, that\u2019s from today\u2019s point of view, hard to predict. We need to see where capital markets go, liquidity availability and yes, a stabilization and return to some degree of normality in the banking sector. But for the visibility that we have today, we are not expecting an improvement in that segment for the remainder of the year. Rachel Vatnsdal : Got it. And then maybe a few questions on China here. So, one of your peers recently signed China bioprocessing, I think you also mentioned that in one of your answers to earlier question. So, can you talk about how did bioprocessing performed during 1Q in China? And can you just give us some context of how big China is for bioprocessing for Danaher? Looking forward, how are those orders trending within China, specifically around some of the localized manufacturers. And then last question, just stepping back, you previously had guided to low-single digit growth for China for the year. 1Q was well above expectations. So, what\u2019s the total co-outlook for China? Thanks. Rainer Blair : Well, as it relates to bioprocessing in China, we have had a very good and strong business there in China for years. And it helped quite significantly in China in order to build the capacity for vaccines and for other biologics. And what we see today, much like we have seen in the U.S. is that the Emerging Biotech segment, which is an important part of China\u2019s efforts to build a local biopharma industry is also impacted by capital constraints. So, we have seen that play out in China as well. And in fact, that\u2019s what is the primary impact on our China numbers here. In the first quarter, which on the whole were better than expected, primarily because of the patient volumes and the diagnostic businesses being stronger. Now, as it relates to the full year in China, we expect our full year in China to be up low-single digits for Danaher overall based on the market recovery, exiting COVID as well as, if you will, a normalization of the activity level in bioprocessing. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Thank you, Rachel. Operator : Thank you. And I will turn it over to the speakers for closing remarks. John Bedford : Thank you, Ashley. I appreciate everyone for joining us on the call today. We will be around all day and rest of the week for the follow-ups. Rainer Blair : Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our team executed well and delivered our quarterly revenue, earnings and cash flow expectations despite a more dynamic operating environment. The resilience of our portfolio showed through in the second quarter. High single-digit base business core revenue growth in Life Sciences and Diagnostics, paired with better-than-expected respiratory testing revenue, helped offset softer base business demand and bioprocessing. Our team's ability to navigate these challenging operating conditions is a testament to their commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. Their actions are helping mitigate supply chain constraints, enhance productivity and improve manufacturing throughput, and we're proactively addressing structural costs while maintaining a healthy cadence of growth investments. Now our second quarter results also highlight the durable balanced positioning of our portfolio. We have an exceptional group of businesses, all powered by DBS, that serve attractive end markets with favorable long-term secular growth drivers. This powerful combination of our talented team, the strength of our portfolio and balance sheet optionality differentiates Danaher and positions us well to operate through today's more dynamic operating environment. So with that, let's turn to our second quarter results in more detail. Sales were $7.2 billion in the second quarter and core revenue declined 7%. We delivered 2% growth in our base business, which was more than offset by a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 9%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined high single digits, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 revenues. High-growth markets declined low single digits, with China down approximately 10%. In China, our Diagnostics businesses benefited from continued recovery in hospital patient volumes, while stimulus initiatives helped drive strength in Life Sciences. This was more than offset by a decline in our Biotechnology business, where a significant deterioration in the funding environment during the quarter led to project delays and an increase in order cancellations. Our gross profit margin for the second quarter was 56.5%. Our operating margin of 20% was down 840 basis points due to the impact of lower volume in our Biotechnology and Diagnostics segments, and costs incurred to adjust our capacity and cost structure in response to COVID transitioning to an endemic state. These actions in this transition year are intended to ensure that we're in the best position to deliver on our long-term growth and margin objectives, while maintaining an accelerated cadence of innovation investments. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.05. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date. This results in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 125%. Our notable strength in free cash flow generation differentiates Danaher and illustrates the quality of our portfolio, business models, and our team's consistent execution. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 17% and core revenue was down 16.5%. In bioprocessing, underlying market conditions weakened further as we move through the quarter, resulting in a high single-digit base business decline. Larger customers are still working through inventory they built during the pandemic, and emerging biotech customers, which we define as customers without a commercialized therapy, continued their efforts to conserve capital. In addition, we saw the ongoing biopharma market correction in China intensify as the second quarter progressed. Given these dynamics, where we can, we've started actively working with our larger customers to help them more quickly manage their inventory down to normalized levels. Now while market dislocations are impacting our near-term growth, recent positive developments have only strengthened our conviction in the tremendous long-term opportunity ahead in the biologics market and for our leading bioprocessing franchise. The number of biologic and genomic medicines in development is meaningfully higher than at any point in history. And during the quarter, we saw notable regulatory approvals for a novel gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the monoclonal antibody-based Alzheimer's therapeutic. These groundbreaking therapies are not only poised to improve quality of life for patients around the world, they're also serving as validation of these emerging therapeutic classes and reinforcing the potential of drugs currently in the development pipeline. Now in May, we completed the combination of Cytiva and Pall Life Sciences, creating a premier global bioprocessing franchise. The combined business, which will go to market under the Cytiva name, uniquely positions us to support customers as they pursue these life-changing breakthroughs. Cytiva's portfolio has the broadest offering in the industry with end-to-end solutions across all major therapeutic modalities and an innovation engine geared towards helping customers bring life-saving therapies to market faster and more efficiently. A great example is the Xcellerex X-Platform Bioreactor Cytiva launched in the second quarter. Now this new bioreactor is optimized to enhance cell culture productivity and increase process intensity to improve manufacturing yields. The X-Platform's modular design also enables customers to more predictively scale from the lab to production across all modalities, including monoclonal antibodies and cell and gene therapies, helping reduce time and cost in biologic drug production. Turning to our Life Sciences segment. Reported revenue grew 5.5% and core revenue was also up 5.5%, including high single-digit growth in our base business. Our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by nearly 10% growth at Leica Microsystems and high single-digit growth at SCIEX. Healthy demand across our life science, research, academic and applied markets, particularly for our more advanced instrumentation, helped offset softness at pharma and biopharma customers. Our genomics consumables based business was up low single digits in the quarter. Growth in plasmids, proteins and gene-writing and editing solutions, which are primarily used in projects that are commercialized or in later stages of the drug development pipeline, remained robust. This strength was partially offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and basic research. Our Life Sciences businesses continue to deliver innovative solutions that are helping accelerate the discovery and development of biologic medicines. IDBS recently released Polar Insight, a biopharma data management platform that is leveraging artificial intelligence to help researchers more quickly analyze datasets to accelerate drug discovery, regulatory filings and technology transfer in the therapeutic development process. And SCIEX launched the Intabio ZT, a front end to the ZenoTOF 7600 that enables researchers to more quickly and more securely identify and validate drug candidates, improving development workflows and pipeline yields. Now moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue declined 13% and core revenue declined 11.5%, with high single-digit growth in our base business, more than offset by lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes at Cepheid. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Leica Biosystems led the way with high single-digit core growth driven by strength in core histology and advanced staining. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up mid-single digits again this quarter, with solid performance across both instruments and consumables and notable strength in immunoassay. In May, Beckman Coulter launched the DxI 9000, their next-generation immunoassay analyzer that automates up to 90% of standard daily maintenance routines while delivering best-in-class throughput. In addition to significantly improving laboratory workflows and efficiency, the DxI 9000 will enable Beckman to provide a full menu of blood virus assays over time, closing an important menu gap and further enhancing the breadth and clinical value of our test menu. That is just one example of how the Beckman team is improving their competitive positioning through innovation, which is helping drive consistent mid-single-digit growth rate. In Molecular Diagnostics, broad-based strength across Cepheid test menu drove another quarter of more than 30% core growth in non-respiratory testing. Customers who benefited from the workflow advantages, Cepheid's GeneXpert delivered for COVID-related testing, are increasingly adding additional assays from our leading test menu, most notably Group A Strep, and hospital-acquired infection assays. And strong momentum for our recently introduced multiplex vaginitis panel, the Xpert Xpress MVP, contributed to mid-teens growth in sexual health testing. In COVID-related testing, Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $300 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $175 million. This was driven both by higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B and RSV. We continue to expect approximately $1.2 billion of respiratory testing revenue for the full year. With COVID now in endemic state, we believe Cepheid is continuing to take share as many customers look to consolidate their point-of-care, PCR, testing platforms on to the gene expert for both respiratory and non-respiratory testing. Their preference for the GeneXpert within their labs and across their health care networks is a testament to the significant value, the unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow provides clinicians. Now moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 2% and core revenue was up 1.5%. Water quality core revenue grew mid-single digits and product identification was down mid-single digits. In water quality, DBS-led execution drove solid growth on top of a double-digit prior year comparison. Strong performance at ChemTreat and Hach was balanced across industrial and applied end markets. At Trojan, equipment sales and order rates remained strong as customers are continuing to invest in larger municipal projects. At product identification, Videojet declined low single digits against the high single-digit prior year comparison. We're also seeing lower activity levels at our industrial and consumer packaged goods customers who are aligning their production schedules with end-use demand. The Videojet team continued their strong cadence of new product innovation this quarter with the release of the 3350 laser marking system. This impressive addition to Videojet's portfolio enables users to mark different sized products and multiple levels of the same product without adjusting the laser, resulting in increased uptime and higher throughput. This is one of several product introductions planned for the year that are helping position the product identification platform for success as they begin their journey as part of Veralto. So speaking of Veralto, we remain on track for a fourth quarter 2023 separation. Veralto will be well positioned in some of the most attractive areas of water quality and product identification. Their portfolio will be comprised of leading companies with durable high-margin business models, supporting customers' mission-critical operations. The Veralto team is looking forward to hosting an Analyst Day in Chicago on September 6, and we hope many of you will attend. So now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year. In the third quarter, we expect core revenue in our base business to be down low single digits year-over-year. We also expect total core revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens percent range primarily as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a third quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26%, which includes the impact of efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID transitioning to an endemic state, particularly within our Diagnostics and Biotechnology businesses. Now turning to the full year 2023. Due to the near-term challenges within bioprocessing, we now anticipate low single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We also expect total core revenue to decline high single to low double digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%. So to wrap up, our team remains focused on consistent execution in the face of a challenging and more dynamic macroeconomic environment. We're confident about the bright future ahead for Danaher. Our talented associates are innovative and passionate about their work and committed to our culture of continuous improvement. Across our portfolio, we're helping customers solve some of the world's biggest health care challenges, including faster, more accurate disease diagnosis and accelerating the discovery, development and manufacture of therapies. Our solutions are at the forefront of improving patient outcomes and ensuring more patients around the world have access to quality care. Financially, we've got a great lineup of leading franchises in attractive end markets with durable, high recurring revenue business models, and our strong free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. The unique combination of our talented team, differentiated portfolio and balance sheet optionality, all powered by the Danaher Business System, provide a strong foundation for creating shareholder value, while helping to meaningfully improve human health. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to John. John Bedford : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Mike Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Mike. Michael Ryskin : Good morning, Rainer. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll start on bioprocessing, the obvious one. You provided a lot of comments during the prepared remarks. But I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about order trends, anything that you're seeing from customers to give you a sense of when that destocking could continue. As part of that, you also talked a little bit about actively managing inventory with the larger customers. Could you just walk us through what that means exactly? And sort of how you see the rest of the year playing out? You gave the total percent number, but qualitatively, what are your thoughts on bioprocess as you go through the year? Rainer Blair : Sure. So let's start with orders. In the first half of the year, our orders were essentially down 20%. And as we look forward here to the second half of the year, we think that our orders will be down modestly. That's a combination of various factors. One being that our large customers, CDMOs, continue to work through inventories. We also see that China continues to deteriorate here from what we saw in the first quarter and certainly saw that deterioration in the second half of the second quarter, and we see that continuing. And then we are actively managing inventories down. While that is not new, we've intensified our efforts there really in order to get as much as possible of the stocking topic behind us here in 2023. Matt McGrew : Mike, maybe just - let me give you a little color on some numbers here, too. I think if you think about the first half, like Rainer said, we were sort of down 20% from an order perspective. And like you also said, I think we'll be down modestly in the second half. But I think it's important to remember, too, this is largely driven by the comps that we've got. So if you think last year, the first half, we had kind of a low double-digit comp, in the second half was more like 20%. So step up, get a little easier here in the second half. I think the important thing that Rainer just said is we have not seen in the order book enough to call an inflection in the market, but I think we will see a step up to a more modestly down number here in the second half. But I would really characterize that as very much comp driven, not some sort of market inflection that we're seeing. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks. Appreciate that. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up on China specifically. You talked a lot about China and 2Q deteriorated, particularly as it touched on biopharma market correction. Could you expand on that just how significant and how protracted do you believe that will be? And it seems like it's really mostly contains the bioprocess, you called out instrumentation in China actually holding in pretty well. What's the difference there? Why is it so specific to just that one part of your business? Rainer Blair : So we saw that continued deterioration in the second half of the second quarter. To give you a sense, China orders were down 20% in the first quarter, 40% in the second quarter, but really 50% in June. And frankly, we don't see that getting better here in the second half. And that's really related to two or three factors. One, the funding environment continued to deteriorate. The foreign investment in projects and capacity has dissipated, it has not returned. There are fewer projects there that are being funded. Also, over the last two, three years, a great deal of capacity has been built, particularly CDMO capacity, but also some with the smaller biopharmas there. And so there's not a lot of additional hardware required here in the short term in the second half, nor are there that many molecules that are being worked on by the CDMOs, meaning that the consumables requirements of that capacity are also lower than we saw here in the first half of the year. And then lastly, and part of this is related to our aggressively managing with our customers to get them to their target inventories, there are a fair number of order cancellations there. So when you put all that together here for China, that is a different picture here in the second half than we saw in the first half. And once again, we're working here, if you aggregate this to the total global biopharma business, to get as much of this as possible behind us in 2023. And just to give you a sense here, our China business in 2022 was about $1.3 billion, slightly over that. We expect that to be about an $800 million business by the end of 2023, which would be about 10% of the total bioprocessing business at Danaher. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate the color. Rainer Blair : Thanks Mike. Operator : And we will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hi Rainer. Good morning to you, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess on the bioprocessing commentary, Rainer, if you just simplify the various moving parts. It seems like large pharma was in-line-ish - early stage was in line-ish. What changed incrementally in 2Q was China? And if that is correct, I think you mentioned China was that down 50% in June, is the second half assuming down 50% for China bioprocessing? And I think you also mentioned Danaher's actively managing customer inventory levels, what does that mean? And what is the implication for fiscal '24? Should any of these issues be lower into '24? Matt McGrew : Vijay, it's Matt. Let me give - I just want to kind of set the numbers for everybody, so we've got what we're looking at for China. As you said, from a revenue perspective, in the first half, we were down, call it, 30%. And we did see May and June sort of get down into the more like 45%, 50% down. So as we sort of think about what we're thinking about for China going forward for the second half, we are kind of contemplating, if you will, for Q3 and Q4 both of those quarters to look like May and June, and call it, 50% plus down. With that, maybe, Rainer, you want to give some color on the commentary. Rainer Blair : Sure. Vijay, as it relates to '24, we have a lot to work through here still, I think, as an industry in the second half of 2023. We talked about the various puts and takes of the destocking that I think you correctly summarized with pharma and emerging biotech. You see the China piece that we're flagging here. And then, of course, actively managing those inventories with our customers here in order to get as much as possible behind us in 2023. And we think 2023 probably is the bottom. Having said all that, it is a little early to be talking about 2024. And as always, as we get closer here to the end of the year, we'll continue to update as we work through the second half here. Vijay Kumar : Understood, Rainer. And Matt, maybe one for you on margin share. I think if your second quarter came in slightly above guidance. But the sequential step down from Q1, that's 450 basis points, can you bridge us on what drove that 450 basis point step-down sequentially? I think some of this is cost actions Danaher undertook? And again, when I look at the annual guidance, I think you implied Q4 is perhaps 31%-ish. What drives the -- 31-ish. What drives that Q4 step-up? And does that assume your bioprocessing inventory levels to step up? Bioprocessing orders exiting Q4, is that assuming like a normalized trends? Thank you. Matt McGrew : Yes. No, I think that's right. You got that right. So Q1, we were kind of call a 31% margin, step down to 26.5% in Q2. I think, we're going to be more like 26% in Q3 and then a step up to 31% in Q4. If you remember, last quarter, we sort of talked about a bunch of capacity adjustment, if you will, measures, not only at Summit Biotech, but remember, significantly at Cepheid, as the volumes there ramp down, we are being pretty proactive about taking down that capacity as we talked about. So really, the step down in Q2, Q3 is largely due to : one, lower volumes; but two, remember, we had this big capacity reduction costs. Those are primarily Q2, Q3, and then they sort of go away here in Q4, combined with higher volume in Q4 is how we get to kind of 31%. That really has no bearing or impact on anything to do with the bioproduction inventory, et cetera. I mean, it just incorporates our guide of kind of bioproduction ex COVID down 10%. So really all about the higher volume and the capacity reduction stuff that we're working on kind of heading out of the P&L in Q2 and Q3. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll take the next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Good morning Rainer, Matt and John. Yes, I was hoping you could put a little bit more teeth into this cost out and just a little bit more color, even if you, I mean in a perfect world, I'd love to see what the actual - what the tailwinds might be for '24 or what the benefit is? But if you're not willing to go down that path, at least help us understand what's perhaps more rooftop versus labor versus - I know when times are tougher like this, maybe your comp accruals are down, but maybe you guys can give us a little detail will be helpful? Thanks. Matt McGrew : Yes. So Scott, the capacity reduction, we talked last quarter that we had about $350 million of cost that was going to come through in Q2 and Q3. We said probably about $250 that was going to be at Cepheid, and that is a rooftop effort, right? During the pandemic, we added some rooftops to kind of meet demand. Now, we're kind of scaling that back. So that is a little bit of a rooftop dynamic as well as a people dynamic as we scale down to where we are. About $100 million of that $250 million is over the same concept, but at BTG, given some of the lower demand there. I would characterize that less as rooftops and more sort of other actions around kind of demand levels, if you will, at BTG. So that's sort of the $350 million we talked about last quarter. Some of that $350 million is going to be sort of one-time, if you will, right? And then probably something in the range of a couple of hundred million of it will be a bit of a one-time cost that we are hitting and taking P&L in this year that probably should come back to us here next year as well, as the savings that we have moving forward. We haven't really talked about the savings, Scott. That's going to be a little bit dependent on how much we can get done here in Q4 or Q3 - Q2, Q3 and then what gets done in Q4 as well. And so, it will be a little bit dependent on how much we can get done as to what the savings, the annualized savings will be. So, we sort of told people last quarter that we kind of update that as we get towards the guide for next year to kind of bake in some of the savings number. So, I haven't really gotten that yet. I've got - I have a sense or an idea, but I do want to see if we can get everything done and kind of where we end up before we talk about how much is coming. But I do think we've talked last quarter about that sort of one-time benefit of, call it, a couple of hundred million dollars. Scott Davis : All right. That's helpful, Matt. And it wasn't clear to me why [AIS] margins were down. Is it kind of price cost, just because I'm assuming had maybe negative actual unit volumes with core up 1.5%? But is it mix price cost? Is there anything - I know there's probably some prep into the spin that may add some near-term costs as well, but some color there would help too? Thanks. Matt McGrew : Yes. Yes, I would say yes to probably all of the above, Scott. I think you're right. It was a little bit of a price cost. I think they are starting to see an environment where they had really good price actions as some of the supply chain issues and supplies and logistics issues, they were able to kind of cover with price. But I think you're right, we're starting to see a little bit of that come down, probably not terribly unusual. Some of it, they were able to offset with other measures. But you're right. I think you kind of look at what happened there in the quarter, it was a little bit of it. Volumes were on the margin sort of down, but the price side did hold us up. But that price is coming down a little bit from where it was, but that was kind of what happened in the quarter. And like you said, also ramping up into the spin here probably had an impact as well. Scott Davis : Yes, that makes sense. Thanks for the color. And best of luck to rest of you guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks Scott. Matt McGrew : Thanks Scott. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Dan. Daniel Brennan : Yes, thanks. Good morning Rainer, how are you doing? Thanks for the questions here. Maybe the first one just on - the company is obviously a superior executor, DBS is at your core. So the string of bioprocess guide down is pretty uncharacteristic, but it's also a situation that has plagued many peers. So I'm sure you're always doing forensic reviews, so you go - your future forecasting improves in terms of what you've learned? So can you just give us a sense of the latest bioprocess guide and what will provide confidence that the factors that surprised you here and led to the latest cuts won't surprise you again, and now the guide incorporates enough cushion. So that investors can have confidence at the bottom of the bioprocess guidance has been reached? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Dan. I appreciate that question. And as you can imagine and as you suggested, we are constantly, continuously improving our forecasting processes even when we get into these unusual circumstances. And I think one of the aspects here is that the demand situation, the production planning of our customers around the world in the short-term is very dynamic in the sense that production plans are being changed as our customers manage their own inventories as they deal with the demand patterns that they're exposed to. And what we have learned out of that is a more frequent touch point pattern that we have to have with our customers in order to ensure that we keep our finger on the pulse of what's going on there. We think that in the discussions that we've had, that taking the approach of aggressively helping our customers manage their inventories to their target levels in order to find what the true demand signal is. As well as thinking about the second half here, with some degree of conservatism, positions as well in what has been a very dynamic environment with a number of new factors influencing demand. So, we think we're well positioned here for the remainder of the year in terms of the bioprocessing guide. Matt McGrew : Maybe, Dan just a bit, maybe just my thoughts on that topic. I think like Rainer said, I think given what we saw in Q2, I think we feel like we've got sort of China in a pretty good place from a guidance perspective given what we saw. Given the fact that we began that active management in earnest in kind of the back half of Q2 and are going to be pretty aggressive with that to get everything, if possible, behind us that we can here in 2023. I think this guide puts us in a pretty good place for the rest of the year. Daniel Brennan : Great. And then maybe just thinking about the exit rates that are implied in the guidance. I know you already commented, Rainer, '24 official guidance will come later. But it'd be really helpful just to get some frame of reference about key inputs. I mean we're coming out somewhere in $930 million this year on earnings, and maybe a little below $10, maybe $980 for '24. I know consensus is still of 10/23 as of this morning. So just any help about how we think about the trajectory in '24, either from an earnings basis. And also even given the low single-digit base guide for this year, how we think about that comp and what that could translate into a starting point for base organic growth in '24? Rainer Blair : So Dan, I do think that it's early to talk about 2024, because we still have an entire half of the year in front of us here with a number of factors to work through. We talked about the destocking dynamic in China, as well as our efforts to actively get the destocking situation behind us here in 2023. And we think that ultimately, we're probably seeing, in 2023, the bottom here and what is the bioprocessing stocking dynamic. And we also - and I talked about this in the prepared comments, are positive about the long-term growth of this business and this industry. But it's just too early to be putting down a marker here in July on how we think about 2024, and do promise to come back here later in the year to update and then, of course, as always, provide our guide in January for 2024. Operator : We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Puneet. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi. Good morning, Rainer and Matt, thanks for taking the questions. So first one, on China, beyond the comments you made and the 50% expectation down for the rest of the year, orders being down. I'm wondering if there is anything fundamental in terms of the shift on the product portfolio? We heard one of your bioprocess peers talk about competition on the less technology-heavy products. Wondering if you're seeing any of that and any share shift there that is also happening in this market? Rainer Blair : Puneet, our point of view on China is that the continued deterioration is far more about demand and funding than it is about local competition. The local competition has always been there. No question during the pandemic local competition became more relevant as lead times extended. And where we do see that local competition, it tends to be more for local China for China therapeutics than for products that find global applications. So for us, this is really a topic at the margin. And the real story here is that the funding environment as well as the stocking situation in China requires further mediation here in the second half, and that's exactly what we're doing in order to get as much of this as possible behind us in 2023. Puneet Souda : Okay. That's super helpful. And then one on capital deployment, if I may. How are you thinking about capital deployment now with EAS spend and the backdrop of somewhat of a rather weak end market in the near term? I know historically, you've pursued leading assets that are usually gross margin accretive, wondering if any of that has changed and if you think services has gained more significance in your framework for capital deployment now? Thank you. Rainer Blair : Sure. So Puneet, for us, M&A require - continues to be the primary form of capital deployment. And we do that when we see the end market, the asset and the model, the financial model aligns with our requirements. And that is relevant for any end market or adjacency that we might be thinking about, and we maintain a consistent perspective there. Now having said that, you've likely noted that our balance sheet is in great shape and we are in a market that provides opportunity, and we continue, as we always do, to work our M&A funnels to find those opportunities where all three lights flip to green, if you will, market company as well as the business model. Puneet Souda : Got it. Okay. Thank you guys. Rainer Blair : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Rachel. Rachel Vatnsdal : Good morning, thank you for taking the questions. So first off, just kind of shifting gears over to the Life Sciences business, that was much better than expected this quarter. And notably, instrument strength was pretty strong, with high single-digit growth at SCIEX and 10% growth at Leica? So could you just walk us through really what drove that strength in instruments this quarter? And then some of your peers have called out a meaningful slowdown when it comes to CapEx spending in some of the customer segments for instrumentation. So, are you seeing any of those same dynamics? And how are you thinking about instrument growth for the full year? Rainer Blair : Thanks for the question, Rachel. So as you suggested, our Q2 Life Sciences business finished, as expected, up mid-single digits. And we've been talking about a normalization process for some time now, and that's also what we're expecting going forward. And I'll come back to that in a minute. But if we look at the strength here of mid-single digits, geographically, the U.S. was okay. I would exclude large pharma there and sort of small biotech where that's relevant. The EU, Europe was solid. And we also saw a good level of activity in China on the remainder of the stimulus for the subsidized loan program that China had in place. Now from an end market perspective, we see the academic end market holding up well. We see the applied markets, if you think of food testing, environmental testing, with some strength. But as I mentioned, we see biotech and pharma softer. If you think about this from a product category perspective, we think lower and less-expensive, perhaps even operating cost versus capital expenditure type of equipment, is impacted more severely than the higher end, which we still see holding up, and you saw that with Leica Microsystems and SCIEX as well. So as we think about the second half here, we continue to be cautious for a couple of reasons. We mentioned that China market, while strong, the subsidies there have come sunset at the end of the first quarter. and we'll have to see how that continues. There's no news on that front going forward. And so we think really the second half ends up being flat for Life Science instrumentation, putting the full year at low single digits as the normalization process, if you will, from what has been over several years now, very elevated growth rate continues. Matt McGrew : And Rachel, that's sort of on the back, too, if you think about the bookings here. I mean our book-to-bill in Life Sciences in the Instruments businesses was a little bit less than one in the quarter. So I think to Rainer's point, we look at the first half year in China for Life Sciences instruments, that was largely a backlog play from stimulus. And as we sort of head into the second half, I think our assumption is that we're going to be flat in those businesses as China stimulus backlog kind of rolls off and not have the impact that it had in the first half. And we just don't see a real step up here in stimulus in the second half. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you for all the color there. Maybe just a follow-up on pricing. Can you walk us through how much was pricing and impact for instruments in the quarter? And what are you assuming for pricing on instruments in the back half of the year? And then as a follow-up, just pricing on bioprocessing. For bioprocessing, it sounds like you took 350 basis points of pricing in 1Q. What was that pricing contribution in 2Q? And then how are you thinking about pricing evolving within bioprocessing in the back half of this year and also just heading into '24? Last year, you guys took 400 basis points of price in bioprocessing. Obviously, the industry is pretty dynamic right now. So any color there would be appreciated. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Rachel, overall, our pricing for the quarter, so overall banner, was up 350 basis points with all four segments remaining above the historical average. And specifically, you were talking about Life Science Instruments, there we saw in the quarter 450 basis points of price. Now as we look forward for the remainder of 2023, we do see that and expect that to moderate somewhat. But we do expect to be above our historical averages here for the remainder of the year. And as it relates to 2024, I think we'll come back to you on that as we get closer here to the end of the year. Operator : Okay. We'll take our final question from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Luke. Luke Sergott : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. This is just kind of - to follow up on Danny Brennan. I know you guys aren't going to give '24 given how everything is dynamic. But I think that the destocking is what it is, right? That's rolling off. That shouldn't be '24, but that sets up an easy comp. And so I was just trying to figure out right now what the industry demand is to support the type of overall industry growth. So typically, the market growth - the bioprocessing market is like high double to mid-teens, and that's in a normalized market. And so how quickly do you think we can get back to that level? And then on top of that, you have the comps, which would take you over that. Or do you think that there are going to be in a period of subdued contraction from a demand and capacity perspective, given COVID rolling off, you have China, the headwinds there? There are several other - the lack of biotech funding. So give us a sense what that normalized market looks like for you guys right now. Matt McGrew : Luke, I mean, I just keep coming back to - it's July. We're in a pretty dynamic market, where we are within the industry. And like you said, there's a number of dynamics that still need to be worked through. We mentioned some of them destocking, China, the fact that we're sort of actively managing through this inventory situation. I know why people are trying to get to a '24 number, but I just think it's too early. We just need to get through the second half. We'll get a better sense of how those dynamics play out, which will give us a lot better sense as we get later in the year and into what we normally guide and what that looks like. I just think that there's so many in parts right now that, unfortunately, I think we just do - we really do need to get through the second half here. Luke Sergott : Yes, I understand. And then, I guess, like can you quantify how much destocking was in the quarter for you guys and kind of year-to-date? Matt McGrew : I mean I could probably come up with some numbers, but it would be imprecise. I think the reality is that it's going to be very customer dependent. It's going to be manufacturing site depending. It's going to be drug dependent. I mean we don't really spend a lot of time trying to figure out how much was destocking as much as spending time with the customers in a pretty proactive way these days, to understand what's on hand, what's the real need that you've got site by site by site so that we can help them manage down to an inventory level they are comfortable with. Some are comfortable with getting down where they were pre-pandemic, some are trying to get below that and some are trying to be above that, actually. So it's not one number that we manage that we're really doing on a kind of neutral basis. I don't know that I've got a great answer for a number, but we are actively managing it and probably a way that was more active than we have been. Luke Sergott : Got you. All right. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. John Bedford for closing remarks. John Bedford : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We'll be around the rest of the day and week for follow-up questions. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Todd, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference. John Bedford : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our Form 10-Q for the third quarter, our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call, and a note containing details of historical and anticipated future financial performance are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations, and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until November 8, 2023. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics related to the third quarter of 2023 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Before turning the call over to Rainer, I'd also like to point out that since Veralto was part of Danaher through the end of the third quarter, our financial highlights will include the combined Danaher and Veralto results. We will then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher. Veralto will be reporting their third quarter results separately later this week, and we'd like to ask that you please save any questions about the Veralto businesses until then. Our guidance for Danaher's continuing operations will exclude Veralto for the fourth quarter and the full year. I'd also like to mention that historical financial results reflecting only Danaher's continuing operations excluding Veralto are available on the Investors section of our website under the sub-heading Financial Reports. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Core revenue in the third quarter came in ahead of our expectations with Biotechnology performing as anticipated, and higher testing revenues more than offsetting slightly softer-than-expected demand in Life Sciences. Our team's consistent DBS-driven execution also enabled us to deliver better-than-expected earnings and cash flow in what remains a challenging and dynamic operating environment. This was also a transformative quarter for Danaher. On September 30, we completed the spin-off of Veralto Corporation, a global leader in water and product quality. The successful launch of Veralto is a testament to the team's execution focus and outstanding teamwork. We believe this separation creates exceptional opportunities for both Danaher and Veralto to better serve their customers, deliver on their respective strategic priorities and create greater long-term shareholder value in the years ahead. Now, I want to thank Jennifer Honeycutt and all the Veralto associates for their contributions to Danaher over the past two-plus decades. And we wish them the very best as they embark on their exciting endeavor to help safeguard the world's most vital resources. Now going forward, Danaher is a more focused life sciences and diagnostic innovator, committed to accelerating the power of science and technology to improve human health. We've got a great line-up of leading franchises, well positioned in attractive end markets with durable, high-recurring revenue business models, and our strong free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. This unique combination of our leading science and technology portfolio and financial strength all powered by the Danaher Business System, differentiates us, and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage. So with that, let's turn to our third quarter results in more detail. Now, as John mentioned, since Veralto was part of Danaher through the end of the third quarter, our financial highlights for the third quarter include Veralto's results. Sales were $6.9 billion in the third quarter and core revenue declined 11.5%, including a 3% decline in our base business and a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 8.5%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined low double digits, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 revenues. High growth markets were down high single digits, including a mid-teens decline in China, where the economic landscape remains challenging. Our gross profit margin for the third quarter was 58.2%. Our operating margin of 20.9% was down 540 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower volume in our Biotechnology and Diagnostics segment and costs related to the separation of Veralto. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.02. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $4.6 billion year-to-date, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 120%. Strong free cash flow generation continues to be one of the most important metrics at Danaher and enables us to actively pursue high-impact organic growth and M&A opportunities. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 19% and core revenue was down 21%. Bioprocessing core revenue declined over 20%, as anticipated, while discovery and medical was down mid-single digits as a result of lower demand from our earlier-stage research and lab filtration customers. In bioprocessing, base business core revenue declined mid-teens and market conditions were consistent with our expectations coming into the third quarter. Our customers are still working through inventory built up during the pandemic, while also continuing to conserve capital as a result of funding pressures. China was down approximately 45% in the quarter, driven by a weak funding environment and lower underlying activity levels. Based on what we're seeing today, we're maintaining our full year outlook of approximately 10% base business decline in bioprocessing, which assumes that market conditions in the fourth quarter are consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. Although these market dislocations are impacting our recent performance, global demand for biologic medicines continues to increase. Since 2018, underlying demand for biologics has grown at an average annual rate of approximately 10%, and is continuing to grow in 2023. In addition to more patients using biologic medicine, this year is on pace to be a record year for FDA approvals of biologics, including approvals for meaningful indications, such as Alzheimer's disease and several cancer immunotherapies. These positive trends reinforce our conviction in the tremendous opportunity ahead in the biologics market and the high single-digit long-term growth outlook for our leading bioprocessing franchise. Now, the pace of innovation and advancement in biologic medicine is accelerating, and Cytiva is uniquely positioned to support customers as they pursue life-changing breakthroughs. Cytiva's recently launched NanoAssemblr, the industry's first end-to-end lipid nanoparticle formulation system, is a great example of how our investments in innovation are supporting customers' needs around quality, yields, and cost. The NanoAssemblr automates and streamlines the lipid nanoparticle manufacturing workflow, helping improve reproducibility and scalability in the nucleic acid therapy manufacturing process. Turning to our Life Sciences segment. Reported revenue declined 1% and core revenue was down 2.5%, including a low single-digit decline in our base business. Our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively declined mid-single digits, in part driven by China, where an already challenging funding environment further deteriorated as the quarter progressed. Outside of China, we continued to see softness at pharma and biopharma customers, while demand remained stable in life science research and applied markets. Our genomics consumables based business declined low single digits in the quarter. Double-digit growth across plasmids, proteins, and gene writing and editing solutions, which are primarily used in projects that are in later stages of the drug development pipeline or have been commercialized, was more than offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and basic research. Our Life Sciences businesses continue to deliver innovative solutions that are helping accelerate the discovery and development of biologic medicine. Molecular Devices recently released the CellXpress.ai, an artificial intelligence driven cell culture system that automates traditionally manual cultivation processes. The CellXpress.ai is engineered to improve workflows and reproducibility in growing and scaling human-relevant cell lines, which can reduce reliance on animal models and fast-track potential therapeutics to preclinical trials. We're also actively leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our capabilities and bring greater value to our customers. In August, we announced our intention to acquire Abcam, a leading producer of protein consumables that are critical for advancing drug discovery, life science research, and diagnostics. Abcam has a long track record of innovation, outstanding product quality, and breadth of antibody portfolio, which positions them as a key partner for the scientific community. The addition of Abcam will give Danaher entry into this highly attractive market, furthering our strategy to help map complex diseases and accelerate the drug discovery process. We expect Abcam will be accretive on multiple levels, including core growth, earnings, and talent, and look forward to welcoming this incredibly innovative team to Danaher once the transaction closes. Now moving to our Diagnostic segment. Reported revenue declined 16% and core revenue declined 15.5%, with mid-single digit growth in our base business more than offset by lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes at Cepheid. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid-single digit core revenue growth. Radiometer led the way with high-single digit core growth and solid results across both blood gas and point-of-care immunoassay product lines. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up mid-single digits with double-digit growth in instrumentation and notable strength across clinical chemistry and immunoassay. Beckman's recent strong performance is a direct result of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve commercial execution. We're seeing better win and retention rates globally, particularly in North America, which grew high-single digits in the third quarter. The team has also been accelerating new product innovation, and there's encouraging early traction in Europe for the DxI 9000, Beckman's next-generation immunoassay analyzer. In molecular diagnostics, increased menu utilization by customers paired with recent new product innovation helped drive over 20% core revenue growth in non-respiratory testing at Cepheid, including more than 25% core revenue growth in Group A strep and sexual health. In respiratory testing, Cepheid's revenue of approximately $350 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $100 million. A higher prevalence of COVID-19 drove both higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B, and RSV. As we move into the fourth quarter and our customers begin planning for the respiratory season, we now expect approximately $1.6 billion of respiratory testing revenue for the full year versus our previous expectation of $1.2 billion. The broad-based strength across Cepheid's testing menu is a result of the team's thoughtful approach to placing systems over the last few years. Customers who realized the benefit of accurate, easy-to-use molecular testing during the pandemic are increasingly consolidating their point-of-care testing platforms onto the GeneXpert and adding additional assays from our leading test menu. Their preference for the GeneXpert within their labs and across their healthcare networks has led to a more than 2.5 times increase in both our installed base and revenue since 2019. And we believe Cepheid is well positioned to continue gaining share and expanding our installed base in today's endemic environment. Now let's briefly look ahead at the expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. As a reminder, both our fourth quarter and full year guidance include only Danaher's continuing operations and exclude Veralto. In the fourth quarter, we expect core revenue in our base business to be down mid-single digits year-over-year. We also expect total core revenue to decline in the high-teens percent range, primarily as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 28%, which includes additional anticipated productivity initiatives to further adjust our cost structure. Turning to the full year 2023, we anticipate core revenues in our base business will be down slightly. And we also expect total core revenue to decline low double digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccine, and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with our third quarter results and believe the combination of our team's DBS-driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis. With the successful spinoff of Veralto, we are now a more focused company committed to deploying leading-edge science and technology to improve human health. Danaher is purpose built to help customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. Our proven ability to innovate is enabling faster, more accurate diagnoses and helping customers reduce the time and cost needed to sustainably develop and deliver life-changing therapies. So, as we look ahead, the unique combination of our talented team, differentiated science and technology portfolio, and balance sheet optionality, all powered by the Danaher Business System, positions us well to maximize value for our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to John. John Bedford : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Dan. Dan Brennan : Hey, guys. Hey, good morning, Rainer. How are you? Thanks for the questions here. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just starting off with bioprocess, if you don't mind, since there's remains, obviously, as you know, a tremendous amount of focus here. I know with Q2, you guys talked about order trends being down modestly in the second half of the year. Sounds like what you're seeing is consistent with that, but I was hoping maybe you can unpack a little bit of color on kind of what's going on in the order side for bioprocess and kind of what you're seeing in the field and kind of what this might portend as we think about looking out to 2024. Rainer Blair : Sure, Dan. Let's start off with Q3 one more time here. So, Q3 results were consistent with what we expected. But also I have to be clear that we have not seen an inflection in orders. And I would say that we're sort of at the bottom here, bouncing along. And to give you a sense of this quantitatively, from -- our book-to-bill was at around 0.8, which is consistent with what we've been seeing here for the last few quarters. And for Q4, we think that looks a lot like Q3 with likely similar book-to-bill. But we do continue to expect our base business through the full year for bioprocessing to be down 10%, so as expected. Matt McGrew : Hey, Dan, maybe just a little bit of other color, too, just to give some sense of what we saw. Orders in dollar terms were actually down a little Q3 versus Q2. And like Rainer said, the book-to-bill here has been at 0.8. It's been like that for six quarters. I think we anticipate that it will be like that in Q4 as well. And I think kind of another triangulation that I look at is kind of on a two-year stack here. Orders have been kind of, call it, down 32%, 33%, 34% here for the last three quarters. So, like Rainer said, I think we're looking at Q4, it looks a lot like Q3, but no real change here. Dan Brennan : Got it. Thanks, guys. And then maybe just one just kind of zooming out a little bit, if you could. Just any way -- any helpful way to think about -- obviously, we have Q4 ahead of us, and you talked about the dynamic environment, which we all -- which we can all see, which we have better visibility, but we can all see it. But as we -- if you thinking about flipping the calendar to 2024, any early way to think about like a framework for revenue growth and earnings and margins as we get into the new year? Rainer Blair : Dan, I think as you look towards 2024, it's really important to understand the context here of the second half, so let me lay that out for you briefly. Once again, our Q3 exceeded expectations. Diagnostics was better than we expected, driven by strength at Beckman Diagnostics and respiratory testing at Cepheid. And bioprocessing was as expected, and we don't believe that changes here either. So, we do believe that we're at the bottom here in 2023 in bioprocessing. That's partially offset by weaker life science instruments. And as a reminder, life science instruments for us is less than 10% of our total business. So, Q3, all in, a solid outperformance in the quarter with what we think are some important markers around diagnostics, bioprocessing and life science instruments. And as you think about Q4, in there, bioprocessing and diagnostics, there's really no change to our prior expectations. We expect those to continue to perform similarly as we've talked about in the past in Q3. Now, as it relates to life science instruments, there we've seen some incremental weakness in Q3 and we would expect that to continue or step down slightly here in Q4. So, with that as a context, for the second half, there's really no change to revenue as Q3 offsets Q4. So, we're holding the full year here. And there's also no change to our bioprocessing expectations for the year, and we continue to believe that 2023 represents the bottom. Now, as it relates to 2024 and given where markets are today and the broader macro, we want to see how Q4 plays out before we provide a guide on our Q4 earnings call in January as we always do. We want to see the next couple of months here play out and then build the guide, as always, for our January earnings call. Dan Brennan : Got it. Thanks, Rainer. Thanks, Matt. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, Rainer. Rainer Blair : Hi, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : One, I just wanted to go back to this bioprocessing. So, with book-to-bill of 0.8x, I guess, is bioprocessing going to grow next year if orders are below revenues in that '23? I don't know if there's a restocking phenomenon. Like, how should we generally broad strokes on bioprocessing, the plus and minuses as we look at the outlook, right? Should China inflect, or any levers that you have that could move bioprocess? Rainer Blair : So, I think I come back to the actual data, Vijay, that we see, which is Q3 really was very similar to Q2. The book-to-bill was the same. We saw the market develop as we had anticipated. You know from our prior call that we've been working with customers here to take some of the tension out of the system and try and ensure that as much inventory is burned off as possible here in the year. And that's why we're confident that this is the bottom. But as it relates to 2024, there's a lot of moving pieces here and it's quite hard to draw generalizations. And that's why it's so important for us also to see the data here for another quarter in Q4 before we talk about what it looks like in 2024. Now having said that, we do expect that this inventory dynamic and what's going on in China is going to also go into, if you will, impact into 2024 as well. This doesn't stop at midnight on the 31st of 2023. But we have seen a stabilization here with the last two quarters, and we want to see how Q4 develops before calling 2024 in January. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Matt, one for you. Thanks for giving the stand-alone numbers. I think it looks like the stand-alone margins here, ex-EAS for Danaher for fiscal '23 is about 28.5% sort of rough numbers, and that includes, I believe, perhaps $400 million of cost actions. What's the right way to think about cost actions, Matt? Is that -- should that all come out next year, so the right jump-off point for us ex cost actions is 30% and that's how we should be thinking about margins for next year? Matt McGrew : Yeah. I mean, I think we'll kind of give a complete update when we come out because the core growth is going to be a big driver of margins. But just on the cost action part, yeah, I think you're right. I think the way I'd probably characterize it is $350 million of one-time cost actions. We talked about $200 million in Q2 and Q3. So that would be, again, the kind of one-time cost actions. Another $150 million here in Q4, and like you said, that will roll forward and help next year. But that is sort of a net number, right, if you will. We will have other pieces, some of them pretty meaningful here that will impact margins. So think of, like I said, first core growth will have an impact. FX, as we sit here right now, is going to have an impact, and there will be some other cost headwinds. So, when we get to the guide here in January, we'll sort of take that net 150 basis points, if you will, of margin tailwind probably and see what those offsets are to end up where we are for '24. But that's $350 million is probably the right number to think about as one-timers that go away here for next year. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Good morning, everybody. Rainer, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, China, kind of down 45% on the biopharma side, I think you said. But could you walk us through, first of all, what is the materiality of China now that Veralto has gone, percent of sales? I don't think we have that number. And second, just kind of walk us through the different markets in China, and maybe any color or outlook or something on how that is bottoming out or hopefully bottoming out? Rainer Blair : Sure, Scott, and thanks for the question. So just to the materiality of China here post Veralto, I think 12% is a good number to think about as a total revenue. And now to your point, let me take you through what we saw across the portfolio here in the third quarter. So, let's start with bioprocessing. There, we did not see a change in market demand, which has been here now for several quarters impacted by a weaker funding environment and excess capacity, and that was down 45%, as mentioned previously. Life Sciences was worse than expected on a weaker macro as well as at the margin, not to overread this, but at the margin, some of the anti-corruption initiatives in the country, which slowed down some equipment tenders, some installation of equipment at the margin. And in Diagnostics, we're seeing consistent patient volumes, and it's largely back to normal. So, we expect -- we don't expect this to change here going forward in Q4, and also expect that this is going to continue into 2024. So, we haven't seen a change in bioprocessing, Life Sciences, the worse at the margin here in Diagnostics as expected and largely back to normal. Scott Davis : Okay. Very helpful. And just to switch gears, there's talk about M&A multiples. In this type of rate environment, you would expect at least some moderation. I didn't feel like Abcam was necessarily cheap despite some of the drama that is out there. It certainly seems fully priced even at higher rates. But as you look at the rest of your pipeline, is there some relief in multiples that kind of reflect the reality of the higher rate environment? Rainer Blair : Scott, I would tell you that we take it, as we always do, based on the end market, the asset and the financial model individually. And as we look at our funnel, which is very active, there's no doubt that some valuations still do not reflect what is a higher and likely for some time, sustained interest rate environment. When it comes down to the individual deal, we bring all aspects together and ensure that the deal model meets our expectations as well. And then, we -- as I've always said, we'll pull the trigger if all those lights flip green on end market, the actual target company, as well as the financial market -- financial model, excuse me. And then, lastly, to reiterate, we do think valuations still have some ways to go here on average in order to reflect the interest rate environment. Scott Davis : Helpful, Rainer. Best of luck. See you guys. See you, Matt and John. Thanks. Rainer Blair : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Michael. Michael Ryskin : Good morning, Rainer, Matt, thanks for taking the questions. Let me follow up a little bit on the Life Science weakness. It sounds like you guys are pretty clear that in 3Q, that was the biggest step down sequentially versus 2Q and versus your expectations. We have it in our notes that LS instruments grew mid-single digit 2Q and now declined mid-single digit 3Q. So, could you parse that out a little bit SCIEX versus Beckman by geographies, by customer? Where you're seeing the slowdown? Do you think it's tied to some of the broader weakness you're seeing in pharma biotech? And just any thoughts on -- you already provided some commentary on 4Q, but any thoughts longer term on when that could return to growth? Just because you think that LS instruments would have a slightly longer order books, you get -- you have a little bit more visibility there. So, some forward commentary would be helpful. Thanks. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Mike. So, let's level set on the numbers here. Our instrument portion of our Life Science tools is less than 10% of Danaher revenue, just to put that in context properly. And as we mentioned, our Q3 performance was modestly below our expectations, with higher-end instrumentation holding up better than the less specialized solutions. Now, if you think about this by end market, academic and life science research have held up well along with the service business that's associated with these instruments. Applied markets were also resilient, led by food and environmental. And within environmental, you are aware of the PFAS testing volumes out there. But pharma and biotech took a modest step down, and that was particularly the case in the U.S. In China, we see large pharma customers also tightening their belts as it relates to capital expenditures. We were just talking about the interest rate environment, and that's playing out here as well. And in China, what we're seeing there is just the sunsetting of the subsidized loan program of the first half of the year and very high comps, as well as the lower funding that's available in the marketplace today in China. So, just to wrap in geographically, our developed markets were down largely due to the softness in pharma and biotech. And China, as we just talked about, was really related to the weaker macro, and, like I said earlier, on the margin only some anti-corruption initiatives there. So, as we wrap up there, I think we remain cautious on LS tools and expect Q4 to be down in the high singles versus -- but still at the low singles for the full year. Now, as it relates to '24, like I said, I think Q4 is a very important quarter here for all kinds of reasons. As you know, in the Life Science business, a lot happens in Q4, and it's also going to tell us a lot as we dialogue with our customers about how to view 2024, which as I mentioned, we'll talk about in January. But I do think it's fair to say that we expect a weaker pharma and biopharma end market here going into 2024. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks. That's really helpful. And then maybe as a quick follow up, I just want to touch on China a little bit. I'm not going to ask about '24 outlook, because I think you made it clear you're not going to address that. But just longer term, structurally, China has been a major part of the growth for tools as an industry and for Danaher over the last five, 10 years. Given everything that's happened over the last year, what's your view on China going forward on a multi-year basis? Will it still be accretive to total company, meaning above total company growth? Or do you think China, sort of, is really taking a step back here and it's going to be a multi-year process for it to return to that level? Thanks. Rainer Blair : We think China long-term continues to accrete to the fleet average from a growth perspective, Mike. The demand in China, we're just at the tip of the iceberg of the demand in China for biologic drugs. And there's no question that we're currently going through a reset that's based on many of the things that occurred during the pandemic, if you think about the funds that were spent in the Zero COVID effort over several years, if you look at how the pharmaceutical industry is playing out in China. But all those things over time moderate, and you come back to an end market which has an enormous demand of a population which has already a large and increasing middle class and is really demanding access to the most advanced medications in the world. So, we continue to see China as a opportunity here in the mid and long term, because the fundamentals are in the right place, although we are going through, if you will, a reset here with different funding sources and so forth in the short term. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Rainer Blair : Hi, Puneet Souda. Puneet Souda : Hey, Rainer, thanks for taking the questions. Quite a bit of coverage here, so maybe let me ask about something that is being discussed in healthcare markets and even now food and consumer markets, and that's the GLP-1s and the diabetes weight loss drugs whose indications are expanding here. So, I'm wondering if you can provide some context on if you see contributions from these drugs in sort of 2024, anything there that can potentially help you offset some of the headwinds? And maybe within that context, if you could also just talk about how should we weigh the GLP-1's opportunities versus Alzheimer's, which is also a very large market, I believe, for the mAbs? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Puneet. Let's start with the GLP-1, which are real and they are growing, and Danaher is represented into some extent, stacked into all of them, and we expect over time for those to contribute to our growth. Having said that, GLP-1s are a class of drugs where the intensity of the use of, if you will, the standard inputs of biologic processes, for instance, such as mAbs, and I'll come back to that part of your question in a second, is not as intense. So, you have synthetic processes for GLP-1s, you have biologic processes, and depending on how that mix develops, that also impacts the degree to which this contributes to our business. This will contribute to our business, and we think that, that provides a modest tailwind here over time. Now, as it relates to your question around Alzheimer's drugs, those are typically monoclonal antibodies, and the use of our industry's products there is far greater than, for instance, in GLP-1 processes. And as those continue to make their way through the development pipeline, through the regulators, and ultimately get reimbursed and then adopted by patients, we expect that to be a more significant tailwind certainly than GLP-1. Puneet Souda : Got it. Super. And then if I could follow up on Abcam, could you talk about where you see the biggest opportunities for cost reduction here in the antibodies business and the protein reagents business? And maybe where DBS can have the most impact? And wondering if -- what do you have in your algorithm longer term for the op margins for this business eventually? Thank you. Rainer Blair : So, Puneet, we have yet to close on this transaction, so we won't be able to talk about the model and its contents in any detail here. But I do want to take a second to reiterate that this acquisition, if that's an entry into a really highly attractive protein consumables market, we estimate that market to be over $8 billion and growing high single digits. And very importantly, because of new detection technologies and other approaches, protein detection is now moving from research to biopharma, and we believe over time to the clinic. And so, you can see how that fits our strategy of helping to map complex diseases, accelerate drug discovery, and hopefully someday even help identify these diseases earlier in their progression. Now, this is a differentiated company with a really terrific brand and a great long-term sustainable business model. We've talked about this, but this is accretive to us in growth, in earnings and also in talent. And we're looking forward to welcoming the team here. We're still focused right now, Puneet, on closing this transaction by mid-2024. Puneet Souda : I appreciate it. Thanks, Rainer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rainer Blair : Hi, Rachel. Good morning. Rachel Vatnsdal : Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I want to follow up with a few more nuanced questions on China. So, first you mentioned that anti-corruption had some impacts to the Life Sciences segment. So, could you quantify the impact there? And then, can you walk us through, are you just seeing that impact in the healthcare and diagnostic hospital settings, or has that started to bleed into pharma and biotech as well? And then, shifting over to more the Diagnostic side for China, another dynamic that we started hearing about in recent weeks is just China volume-based procurement. So, can you walk us through what you're hearing on that front and what your potential exposure to that would be? Rainer Blair : Sure, Rachel. Starting with anti-corruption, we really do see this as a transitory effect. There were some weeks, if I can say it that way, where we saw particularly equipment tenders being postponed, delayed, as well as the installation of hardware, so larger capital equipment. But frankly, we've seen that wane here, so come back to normal, if you will, in the last couple of weeks. And that applies both to what we saw there in Life Sciences, really, at the margin, as well as what we see in Diagnostics. So, I would not view the anti-corruption initiative as a shorter or even mid-term growth headwind. Frankly, in the long term, we think this is a positive as it levels the playing field for multinationals in China. Matt McGrew : As far as the value-based procurement, Rachel, I think the best way to kind of think about it is I think we think it's going to be about a $50 million kind of annual headwind here for us over the next couple of years. Most of that is at Beckman Diagnostics. So I mean maybe kind of a simple math is $800 million of Beckman revenues and maybe 40% of that is sort of subject to the VBP kind of assume a 50% type price reduction there and you get to $150 million. We think that's kind of two, three year kind of run rate here. So, pretty modest and manageable for us over the period. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then, my follow up is just around Diagnostics. So, you guys listed that respiratory expectations for the year to $1.6 billion versus prior assumptions around $1.2 billion. So, how should we think about that endemic number for respiratory? Is $1.2 billion still on average the really way to think about this respiratory market? And then just heading into 2024, giving you guys listed expectations for this year by $400 million, should we expect a softer year next year for respiratory as well? Thank you. Rainer Blair : Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good question on the $1.2 billion. I think that's probably where my baseline would be, Rachel. And I think we did a little bit better this year because we had another respiratory season that started earlier than normal, right? Just like last year, similarly, we saw sort of September and October, the ILI kind of spiked up. That is usually something in the past that we have seen more in the January-February timeframe. So if I think about the last couple years and think about that, I think $1.2 billion would be sort of where I would base it as a planning kind of purpose going forward. But we sort of typically, as we look forward from planning perspective, do that. We look at the last couple years of ILI and try and mirror that. So that's kind of where I think I'd be. Operator : Thank you. And that was our last question today. I will now turn the call back over to John Bedford for closing remarks. John Bedford : Thank you everybody for joining. We'll be around the rest of the day for questions. Rainer Blair : Thanks, everyone. Operator : And this does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

We delivered better than anticipated core revenue in each of our segments in the fourth quarter led by respiratory revenue at Cepheid. The combination of higher than expected revenues and our team's strong execution enabled us to exceed our margin and cash flow expectations in what remains a dynamic market environment. Now before I get into the details of our performance, I wanted to briefly reflect on the progress we made to enhance our portfolio and accelerate our strategy this year. 2023 was a transformational year for Danaher as we continued to strategically enhance our portfolio and strengthen our growth and earnings trajectory. With the successful spin-off of Veralto in September, we're now a focused Life Sciences and Diagnostics Innovator. Establishing Veralto as a standalone public company was one step in our portfolio transformation over the last several years, which has increased our exposure to end markets with durable secular growth drivers. The acquisition of Abcam, which closed in December, further increases our exposure to these highly attractive markets. Now over the long term, we believe Danaher will be a faster growing business with higher margins and stronger free cash flow generation. 2023 was also a challenging year operationally as pandemic tailwinds became headwinds in our businesses. Our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System helped us navigate these challenges while maintaining a healthy cadence of growth investments and productivity initiatives geared towards improving our cost structure. While we expect this transitional period to continue through the first half of 2024, these proactive steps paired with the transformation in our portfolio provide a strong foundation for sustainable long-term revenue and earnings growth. So with that, let's take a closer look at our full-year 2023 financial results. Sales were at $23.9 billion and core revenue declined 10%, including core revenue in our base business which was down slightly and a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 9.5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin was 28.7% and adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $7.58. We also generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 120%. Strong free cash flow generation is one of the most important metrics at Danaher and 2023 marks the 32nd consecutive year our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio exceeded 100%. We continued to accelerate investments in innovation throughout the year, which enabled us to deliver several impactful new technologies to our customers. In Biotechnology, Cytiva's new Xcellerex X-platform bioreactor is helping improve manufacturing yields and reduce the time and cost of biologic drug production. In Life Sciences, new products such as IDBS' Polar Insight and Molecular Devices' CellXpress.ai are helping accelerate the drug discovery process and bring life-changing therapies to market faster. And in Diagnostics, new solutions such as Beckman Coulter's DxI 9000 next generation immunoassay analyzer are enabling faster, more accurate patient diagnosis. These are just a few of the many examples across Danaher of how we're positioning our businesses for continued growth and delivering on our commitment to help customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results in more detail. Sales were $6.4 billion in the fourth quarter and core revenue declined 11.5%, including a 4.5% decline in our base business and a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 7%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined low double digits driven by lower respiratory and COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenues coupled with ongoing investment normalization in pharma and biopharma end markets. High growth markets were down high single digits including a mid-teens decline in China where the economic landscape remains challenging. Our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 59%. Our adjusted operating margin of 28.7% was down 420 basis points primarily due to the impact of lower volume in our Biotechnology and Diagnostics segments and costs related to productivity initiatives. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.09 and we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 21% and core revenue was down 22.5%. Bioprocessing core revenue was down over 20% as anticipated and discovery and medical declined high teens. In bioprocessing, base business core revenue declined high teens in the fourth quarter and was down approximately 10% for the full-year 2023. Revenue and order trends were largely consistent with what we saw in the third quarter including our book-to-bill ratio. We were encouraged to see a modest sequential improvement in orders this quarter with some of our customers returning to normal ordering patterns, but we haven't yet seen a broad-based inflection in demand. The environment in North America and Europe is stable with customers still working through inventory built up during the pandemic. Demand and underlying activity levels in China remain weak as customers are continuing to conserve capital and prioritize programs. For the full-year 2024, we expect core revenue in our Bioprocessing business to be down low single digits. This includes an assumption of a mid to high teens revenue decline in the first half of the year followed by a gradual improvement to a core growth rate of high single digits or better as we exit 2024. Despite the near-term headwinds from destocking, our confidence in the health and long-term growth trajectory of the biologics market remains as strong as ever. Underlying demand for biologic medicines continues to rise. 2023 was another record year of FDA approvals for biologic and genomic medicines and the development pipeline is meaningfully higher than at any point in history. These positive market trends reinforce our conviction in the tremendous opportunity ahead and the high single-digit long-term growth trajectory for our leading bioprocessing franchise. Over the last several years, Cytiva has been accelerating investments in innovation to bring impactful new solutions to customers as they advance therapies from the lab through to commercial production. A great example is the recently launched Cytiva protein select technology, an affinity chromatography resin designed to optimize recombinant protein purification. This new technology simplifies the purification process in recombinant proteins, of which there are currently more than 1,800 in development, and enables faster and more efficient process development. Turning to our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue declined 1% and core revenue was down 4% including a low single-digit decline in our base business. Our life sciences instruments business collectively declined mid-single digits with trends in the fourth quarter largely consistent with the third quarter. We saw continued growth from academic and life science research customers globally while investment levels at pharma and biopharma customers remain constrained, particularly in China and in North America. We also expanded our capabilities and portfolio with the acquisition of Abcam, which closed in December 2023. The addition of Abcam to our Life Sciences segment expands our presence in the highly attractive proteomics market and is furthering our strategy to help map complex diseases and accelerate the drug discovery process. We couldn't be more pleased to welcome this highly talented and incredibly innovative team to Danaher. Our genomics consumables base business was essentially flat in the quarter. Robust demand across plasmids, proteins, and gene writing and editing solutions was offset by decline in next generation sequencing and basic research. During the quarter, IDT opened a new cGMP oligonucleotide manufacturing facility at their Coralville, Iowa campus. IDT can now offer a complete CRISPR workflow from design to analysis that supports cell and gene therapy customers in all stages of therapeutic development. This expansion of our capacity and capabilities is both enabling our customers important work today and fulfilling IDT's vision of improving patient lives by facilitating faster development and commercialization of life changing therapeutics. Moving now to our Diagnostics segment. Reported and core revenue both declined 8.5% with high single-digit growth in our base business more than offset by lower respiratory revenue at Cepheid. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered high single-digit core revenue growth. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics led the way with over 10% core revenue growth, including double-digit growth in both instruments and consumables and notable strength in clinical, chemistry, and immunoassay. This strong performance in the fourth quarter rounds out a terrific year for Beckman where the team has been doing a fantastic job improving their competitive positioning through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution. In molecular diagnostics at Cepheid, increased menu utilization by customers paired with recent new product innovation helped drive low teens core revenue growth in our non-respiratory business, including high teens or better core revenue growth in Group A Strep and sexual health. In our respiratory business, Cepheid's revenue of approximately $650 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $350 million. The high prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses drove both higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B, and RSV. Based on what we saw the last two years and discussions with customers and public health experts, we believe annual respiratory revenue in a typical respiratory season will be approximately $1.5 billion. This increase from our initial assumption of $1.2 billion per year is driven by an expectation of modestly higher volumes and a greater mix of our 4-in-1 tests. The durability and continued share gains at Cepheid are a testament to the significant value that Gene-Xpert provides customers at the point-of-care, close to patients where the most impactful diagnostic and treatment decisions are made. Cepheid's 4-in-1 test has become the standard of care for clinicians given its ability to provide a fast accurate lab quality diagnosis for four distinct respiratory illnesses with a single easy-to-use cartridge. Looking ahead with our differentiated positioning and respiratory testing, a leading installed base of more than 55,000 systems, and with growing adoption of the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market; Cepheid is well-positioned to help customers meet their clinical needs and continue gaining market share. Now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the first quarter and the full-year 2024. Beginning with the first quarter of 2024, we will provide guidance for core revenue growth, but will no longer report base business core revenue as the pandemic has transitioned to an endemic state. Now in the first quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect the first quarter adjusted operating margin of approximately 28%. Turning to the full-year 2024. We anticipate core revenue to decline in the low single-digit percent range, which assumes a core revenue decline in the first half of the year before returning to growth in the second half of 2024. Additionally, we expect our full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus the full-year 2023. So to wrap up, we're pleased to deliver fourth quarter results ahead of our expectations in what remains a dynamic environment. Despite the challenges we saw throughout 2023, we continued to strengthen our portfolio with M&A and took proactive steps focused on improving our cost structure. Our team's consistent application of the Danaher Business System also drove lasting process improvements in our businesses and enabled the launch of several breakthrough solutions. Reflecting back on the past few years, it's clear that Danaher is exiting the pandemic a much better stronger company. We established our dental and environmental and applied solutions segments as standalone public companies in Invista and Veralto. We largely replaced their revenue contribution with higher growth, higher margin annuities with the acquisitions of Factiva, Aldevron, and Abcam. Additionally, Cepheid's respiratory franchise is now six times larger today than it was prior to the pandemic and we expect this to be sustainable. So putting it all together, we've improved our long-term growth trajectory, significantly expanded margins, and strengthened our free cash flow generation. So, our future is bright and I'm excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. The unique combination of our incredibly talented team, differentiated science and technology portfolio, and balance sheet optionality all powered by the Danaher Business System provides us with a strong foundation to maximize value for our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn it back over to you, John. John Bedford : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Rainer, maybe starting off just on bioprocess. Could you give us a little breakdown here in terms of the outlook that you're providing say for China and then rest of world? And then I was hoping as well you can give us a snapshot maybe of how much inventory do you think your customers have today and how much of that changed versus the peak and kind of what does your guidance assume kind of when that inventory reaches a normal state? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Dan. Good morning. And why don't I start off with sort of an overview here on how we've laid out the guide and then we can dig into your bioprocessing question in a little more detail. So, our guide for the full year of 2024 on revenue is down low single digits and now let me break that open and talk about the segments. Biotechnology will be down low to mid-single digits and that's different than bioprocessing. So, keep in mind I'm not talking about the Biotechnology segment in its entirety. The guide is down low to mid-single digits. Life Sciences down low single digits and Diagnostics up low single digits. And once again overall, that's then down low single digits. Now at a high level, we actually expect the dynamic to be opposite of 2023 with a slow first half returning to growth in the second half. And now let me talk just a little bit about the assumptions around our guidance. Starting with bioprocessing, which we're guiding to be down low single digits and we think the first half will look a lot like second half of 2023 down mid to high teens coming off of a fourth quarter which showed incrementally improved orders versus Q3. Second half we expect to return to mid to high single-digit growth and we believe by then that the destocking in North America and Western Europe will have largely been completed and of course the comps ease there as well. So importantly for bioprocessing, we think exit rate for the year will be high single digits or better core growth. Now if we look at Life Sciences, we expect Life Sciences to be down low single digits for the guide and we expect a slow start and we should see growth improve here through the second half given some of the comps that we have seen as the normalization, particularly in the instrument business, continues and we've been talking about that for some time and we expect that to continue into 2024 as well. Now if we look at that by end market and see pharma and biotech, stable but at lower levels of demand; and then academic and applied markets holding up comparatively better. Geographically, we see China weak with a slower macro and of course in Life Sciences in particular, we have some prior year comps related to the subsidized loan program there. And then lastly on Life Sciences, we expect developed markets to be relatively consistent with 2023. As we look at Diagnostics, which we are guiding up low single digits, we see no change to the underlying trends, patient volumes have normalized. And in the non-respiratory business, we expect growth of mid-single digits and of course that's offset by lower respiratory revenue, which was $1.9 billion in 2023 and we anticipate that that will be $1.6 billion in 2024. So Dan, that's how the year shapes up by segment and of course then we can now perhaps talk a little bit more detail around bioprocessing. Matt McGrew : Dan, maybe to just kind of to put some numbers around your question as well. So I think China for the year for bioprocessing, you should probably think about the first quarter being down similar to what we saw in Q2, Q3, and Q4 last year call it north of 40%. And then I think for the full year, I just think even that will still be down kind of mid-teens for bioprocessing in China. That's sort of what we've got dialed in. And as far as the rest of the world, I think we'll be down in the first half and then kind of return to growth here in the second half after we get past the destocking. And I know you asked how much kind of inventory is in China. It's kind of hard to say, Dan. I mean we've got a kind of a moving target, but we've got a good sense that what we will largely be through most of the destocking, particularly in North America and Europe where it was probably the biggest. I think we're going to be through that here in the first half, which then sort of speaks to why we think it gets a little bit better in the second half of the year. Dan Brennan : Got it. Thanks, guys. And then maybe a follow-up just on bioprocessing. That's such a huge focus. Just in terms of the guide that you've laid out, what does that assume from kind of a book-to-bill or bookings trajectory as we work through the year? And just kind of related to that, several peers have already pointed to book-to-bills kind of above one. Obviously, everyone's order books are, mix of business is different. But what's kind of unique about your business, do you think? Is it clinical versus commercial, or is it just the size of your book or just any color? Why do you think some of the peers have seen the turn in their business faster than what you guys have seen? Thank you. Matt McGrew : Yes, let me give you a little bit of color on how I'm thinking about the guide or how we're thinking about the guide. Maybe start with - this is for bioprocessing. Start with kind of a qualitative overview of what this guide sort of is, right? This guide calls for a slight improvement versus our demonstrated book-to-bill of the last couple quarters. We've been in that kind of 0.8, 0.85 range the last four or five quarters. And we are not calling for an inflection at any point in the year, but we are assuming some modest improvement as we move through the first half into the second half. Like I said before, as we think that North America and Europe destocking is largely behind us after the first half. So, no inflection, sort of just kind of gets a little bit better than where we were. As far as kind of some numbers around that, Dan, maybe start with the backlog. So, we're starting with about a quarter and a half of backlog. That's pretty consistent with where we were in 2018, 2019. So, I think we're back to backlog levels that are, relatively speaking, pretty much in line with history. And then you start with that backlog and add this book-to-bill assumption in there. We are assuming book-to-bills improve slightly, like I said, kind of from the 0.8, 0.85s into the 0.9s. And that those will get a little bit better every quarter, as we build through the year. But we are not assuming book-to-bills go above one in any given quarter. And so that kind of assumes that, we get past the inventory destocking in the first half. The second half gets a little bit better. And that we're kind of exiting here, like I said, the first half will be down mid-teens. Mid-to-high teens for the second half we exit with high single-digits or better without seeing an inflection. And I think maybe, I know that there's been some questions on that second half ramp as well. Maybe just to give people some quantitative numbers on that. So the second half ramp in bioprocess assumed in this guide is about a $250 million year-over-year second half increase. So that's on a, call it a $6.5 billion business. So yes, there is a step up. But I think it's relatively modest on a business with $6 billion to expect that we think we could do a couple hundred million dollars better year-over-year in the second half as we move past the destocking. So hopefully that helps frame the guide a little. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Good morning, Rainer. And thanks for taking my question. So I guess I'll start off with those last comments from Matt. The Q1 guidance here, Rainer, on biotech and bioprocess being down in low 20s, I guess we did see sequential order improvements in Q4 for bioprocess. What is driving, and comps to get easier for you for Q4 to Q1 on biotech comps to get easier. So what is driving the minus 20% maybe thought process around the Q1 guidance assumptions? And also have you - I know there was a no-fee cancellation policy. Has that stopped for Danaher? Matt McGrew : Yes, Vijay, it's Matt. Maybe I'll take a first stab at it. So, if we think about kind of the first half here, I think it's probably instructive to sort of remember where we were. If you remember, our base business core growth in Q1 last year was actually up low single-digits. And for the first half of 2023, we were only down kind of low to mid-single-digits in total, right? The second half, we were down mid-teens or high-teens, as everybody remembers. But we do have that comp coming in the first quarter. And so, when you think about year-over-year, that's really the biggest factor. As far as sequential goes, kind of Q4 to Q1, I would tell you that we would, you know, I think we talked about this in January. Our Q3 to Q4 sequential, that's pretty normal. That's a normal Q3 to Q4 step up. I think we attributed that to a normal seasonality when we were out at JPMorgan. And it's very also normal to see Q4 to Q1 step down. So, just maybe some numbers to that. Q4 is usually 27%, 28% of our year, and Q1 is usually 24% and 25% of revenue for the year. So, I mean, it's pretty normal for us to see it. I think we saw it even, in kind of a heyday of '21 to '22, we saw it step down. So, I think there's a normal seasonality. And I think the other big thing to remember is, and it kind of ties into your last question there, Vijay. We are actively trying to continue to destock and get as much of this behind us as we can. And so I think, we've been pretty aggressive with that. We're going to remain aggressive with that. I think you're seeing that hopefully, here in the first half that we are. And back to your kind of no-fees question, it depends is the answer. But rest assured, we are doing what we can to get to the second half of the year. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And I guess my follow-up here, Rainer, is when you look at customer activity levels or consumption, if you will, what's been the underlying activity at customer levels, when we think about drug volumes being up high singles in that space, is that still intact? And sort of, I guess, one on diagnostics, if you will, last year you guys did base diagnostics up double-digits. And I think you mentioned mid-singles for this year. So is that just a comp issue? Why diagnostics would slow down? Rainer Blair : Thanks, Vijay. Well, starting with the activity level here for bioprocessing. We've really seen no change in the activity level, which continues to be along the long-term growth rate that we've been talking about, high single-digits, 10%. And that's what's been important in terms of drawing the inventories down. So and it aligns with how we spoke about the regional developments here. Which Western Europe and North America are drawing down inventories more rapidly than perhaps regions that are more, small biotech, emerging biotech companies such as China. So, the activity level continues to be strong. I mentioned to you during the prepared remarks that we've seen a historic level of both approvals as well as number of projects in the biologic development pipeline. So, we continue to be very confident in a - continued positive development there. Vijay Kumar : Thank you. And sorry, on diagnostics, Rainer? Rainer Blair : Yes Vijay, I mean, I think it's just - it's all going to be mostly a comp issue. The base business, the business outside of, I should say, respiratory continues to do well for Cepheid. All of the other businesses in diagnostics, no real change, to the underlying demand. So it's going to be a comp issue. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Rainer Blair : All of diagnostics, yes. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Hi good morning, guys. Good morning, Rainer, Matt and John. Guys, can you help us, when volumes are kind of still moving negative in the first half of the year, it's hard to get your arms around kind of what you've done to the cost structure with the 50 basis point guide up. Is there anything we can look at, any KPIs you can share around, like, headcount reductions or rooftops or anything that you guys have kind of tangibly done internally on costs that, you can share that helps us understand, perhaps what that impact on margins will be and not just '24, but going forward? Thanks. Matt McGrew : Yes. Yes I mean, maybe the way to think about the OP kind of at a high level Scott, is we ended 2023 with an adjusted operating margin of call of, almost approximately 28.5%, and we think, like you said, it's going to be up 50 bps here in the year. We had $350 million of sort of one-time costs last year, some of that, if I think about what that was and the metrics around it, I would tell you that there's a lot of heads that did come out. And largely that was reflective of the lower volumes that we saw last year, particularly at Cepheid as we went from 70 million tests down to 35 million. We sort of knew there would come a day when we were going to need to pull back some of that capacity, and largely last year we did that. I think you also saw it at some of the other businesses in the second half as well in life sciences and some others that have seen a little bit more difficult growth profiles. I think largely it is heads. There are some rooftops here and there, but I think it's more trying to get after the cost structure to right-size it, for what's going to be a difficult first half, so that we're in a good spot. So, that $350 million of benefit that, would have been about 150 basis points on its own, Scott. But we do have the lower volumes, as you mentioned, in bioprocessing, respiratory, and that basically offset all of it. And so really the cost savings, if you will, from that $350 million that we deployed, is what we're getting and flowing through as the 50 bps of margin expansion. So that should be pretty durable as we go. And hopefully, with a little bit better volume here, and the gross and adjusted operating margins, we have, a little bit of volume is going to go a long way. Scott Davis : Got it. I would imagine so. Guys, can you help us understand China? I understand that, I guess consistent with last quarter and the guide and such, still pretty conservative. How do you kind of separate the cyclical versus kind of, what I'll call the secular, which is perhaps maybe government policy and other impacts are out there? I haven't been to China in a while, so perhaps maybe you guys can help us understand the puts and takes there, and is that market still attractive long-term, or has there been some sort of change at the margin there that perhaps makes it less interesting? I'll just kind of open it up to that. It's a lot of white space, if you will? Thanks. Rainer Blair : Sure. Scott China, let me start with this. We continue to believe China is an attractive market in the long-term that is going to be accretive to our overall growth, and the reason for that is that the Chinese government and frankly, the Chinese people are prioritizing, among very few priorities, they're prioritizing healthcare. More broadly, but also more specifically in terms of building their own pharmaceutical industry. With both generic and innovative and biosimilar type drugs. And that process, while it has taken a pause here, or certainly slowed as the funding environment has become more difficult in the short-term, we expect that process to work itself out here in the midterm. Now, for China this year, as it relates to our guide, we're assuming that China will be down high single-digits. Yes, because of the challenging macro. We actually expect that macro to be more challenging than perhaps even what we see in the healthcare market, but we're not planning in that guide, a stimulus from the Chinese government, but more of the same and then of course, the reversing of tough comps here in the second half. So it's going to be a tougher start to the year, as the activity level essentially remains where it has been here in the second half of 2023. Particularly in biotechnology and life sciences, and then as we get through those tougher comps in the first half, we'll see the second half where we're not assuming significantly higher activity levels, but we do see the math then working in our favor. Longer term, we believe the pull and the requirement in China for these innovative and highly effective drugs is intact and that the investment will continue. Scott Davis : Very helpful. Best of luck in 2024, guys. Thank you. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Michael. Michael Ryskin : Great. Hi, Rainer. Hi Matt. I want to follow-up on a couple of your comments from earlier in the Q&A just on bioprocessing to make sure I got it right. I mean first, I think you called out that, you don't expect a book-to-bill above one at any point during the year. So, I mean, that means you'll be continuing to deplete the backlog all year, but you already cited that the backlog, is sort of at a normal level with 1.5 quarters. So, I'm just wondering, how low is that going to get over the course of the year then if your book-to-bill doesn't break one? And then sort of related to that, if you've only gotten one to two quarters of backlog and yet you're calling for this gradual improvement as the year goes on, high single-digit growth rate, just sort of like what underpins that improvement from what you do see in 1Q, 2Q to start the year? Matt McGrew : Yes, I mean, I think the way we talked about the guide, I mean, I did say that it doesn't go over one, but it gets pretty close in the second half. I mean, if you do the math, it does get pretty close to one. So I think, it is still a little bit early to call what we're going to see in '25, but I think you're right. We are calling for gradual improvements in the book-to-bill through the year, and it will get pretty close to one, but not over one in the second half. That's kind of how we're thinking about it. And as far as the growth rate, first half to second half, I think was your question, is that right, Mike I want to make sure? Michael Ryskin : Yes, just visibility, not improvement? Matt McGrew : Yes well, I mean, like I said, it's not a huge number, right? First half to second half, you're talking about $250 million. So we are, I think the visibility, is improving a little bit here as we move into the year, and we expect that it will continue to do so, as we move past the inventory destocking in the first half. And so I think, with the assumption of a ramp, admittedly, but only on - only of a couple hundred million dollars. I just feel like, if we can get past the destocking, be aggressive with that, having a second half ramp that is, $250 million on $6 billion, it's not that steep in reality. And frankly, we constructed the guide to have no real, kind of step up, or inflection either in bioprocessing. It may not happen that way, right? And if it does happen, if we do see something, an inflection that's higher, we obviously will update the guide and update everybody. But we are trying to just lay out how we are thinking about not having an inflection, not calling an inflection. Things are getting a little bit better. They're going to get better through the year. And certainly given the math and the anticipated modest step up, that's how you sort of get to a second half of tight single-digits. Remember, we're also working on a comp of the second half that's going to be down high teens. So, I think that's what gives us sort of the confidence is, we've got a little bit better customer visibility. We think we're going to be behind the destocking, and we've got some comps that will help those numbers. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. I thought the $250 million was second half-to-second half, not first half to second half. But I can follow-up on that? Matt McGrew : No, that is second half-to-second half. Yes, that's second half-to-second half. I'm sorry yes, yes. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. We'll follow-up offline. Just a follow-up question. I want to ask a little bit on the Life Sciences segment and maybe put another way. I want to think about from a customer perspective, can you talk about pharma and biotech outside of bioprocessing, putting bioprocessing aside? For the rest of pharma and biotech, it seems like your outlook is still somewhat cautious. You're talking about low levels of demand. I'm just curious, any early signs? I know we're still in January, still early in the year, but just sort of how those companies are thinking about budgets for the year, how the Life Science segment and pharma and biotech specifically recovers post-2023? Thanks. Rainer Blair : So, Michael, just to level set then, coming off a Q4, which the life science tools were down mid-single digits, and that was largely consistent with Q3, and we anticipate that this normalization in life science instruments, which really began in the second half of 2023, will continue in 2024. And if we think about it by end market, we do see pharma and biotech stabilizing, but at these lower levels of demand. Just because we believe and saw in the numbers showed here, over the last two years or so, an anomalous level of buying and pulling forward of demand, whether that was China through loan subsidies or whether that was COVID dollars infused for additional research, we expect that normalization to continue here. Also, in the first quarter, where we expect life sciences to be down similarly to the fourth quarter. Now, keep in mind for us, life sciences instruments is only about 10% of the portfolio. So, we may not be a good read across here. Nonetheless, we do think it's going to take some time here in the first quarter, first half, in order for that normalization to occur. But we do believe that it's stabilizing at this lower activity level. Michael Ryskin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Rachel. Rachel Vatnsdal : Thanks so much. Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I wanted to push a little bit more on bioprocessing. You've noted that you're not modeling an inflection in that business this year, but can you talk about if you're seeing any of these green shoots from customers, signaling that they may have gotten too lean on inventory? And then if we look back at last year, you'd mentioned on the 4Q call that, you'd had conversations with customers that shifted your expectations around bioprocessing and order trends at the JPMorgan conference last year. So, can you talk to us about how those conversations with customers trended at the conference this year and how that's impacting the guide as well? Matt McGrew : Yes, maybe I can start, and Rainer can probably - he had more of the customer conversations than I did, if we're being honest. So yes, I mean, I think when we think about the guide and you think about green shoots, I think maybe the way I would characterize it, is we - you know, six months ago, there were no anecdotes. There were no customers coming and saying, I needed something quickly. There were no pull-forwards from out-quarters into this quarter. I think, we have started to see a little bit more of that here anecdotally. I don't think it is widespread enough to be able to say, we're going to be beyond this in the next two, three months, which is why we sort of have our - the first half tagged where we do. But combined with the - our tracking of the inventory, so we do know where it is at. We've got a much better handle on that. Combined with sort of some of these anecdotes and frankly, a little bit better sort of funnels that we are seeing, we do feel like we've got a little bit better visibility as we head into the year, which gives us the confidence, as we talked about earlier, to think that the de-stocking is going to be largely behind us as we get through the first half. And that's sort of how we modeled into the - into the book-to-bill slowly kind of getting up. But not wanting to get, real aggressive and call a big inflection anywhere. So that's sort of how we - what we've seen here over the course of the last probably three, four months. So anecdotally, a little bit better situation out there. Are hearing some good things that you want to call it a green shoot, I suppose you could, but I'd probably call it, a good anecdote that is now starting to see more of those and sort of less of the negative ones, if you will. And maybe, Rainer, you want to talk about the customer discussions at JPM? Rainer Blair : And just really just to confirm that we continue to see a trend of more positive conversations of customers returning to normal order patterns, thinking about how they're planning out not only the first, but the second half of the year. So all of these conversations are directionally, we believe, positive and sort of support what we saw also in the sequential improvement, which was partially seasonal certainly, but we also saw some improving order patterns there. So what we're looking for ultimately, and that's what Matt referred to previously, is a broad-based improvement in order patterns, at which point we will update accordingly. But where we sit today, we think that the first half will be slower also related to some of the comps that we talked about and that the positive development, which we've seen here in the past months, will continue and then manifest itself really in the second half where we then exit with high single-digits or better exit rate. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then my follow-up, I wanted to just press a little bit more on this pace of recovery within bioprocessing. So, one of your peers has slowly been taking up their book-to-bill sequentially over the last few quarters. They just recently crossed that 1.0 level. That said, though, Danaher is really one of the few companies, or only that has been actively working with customers to manage their inventory levels. So while I appreciate the guidance, isn't modeling a massive inflection at some point this year in bioprocessing, how should we think about that impact in managing your customers' inventory levels on what that does to the pace of recovery? And is there some reason why we shouldn't see more of a V-paced recovery - V-shaped recovery excuse me for Danaher? Thank you. Matt McGrew : Well, I mean, I think it's a little bit tough. When everybody is going to be, while we are all in the same kind of boat, I think everybody will have a slightly different timing about when we get through sort of the inventory destockings. So, I think part of it is going to be the breadth of our portfolio. Part of it is going to be the geographic mix we have, and part of it is going to be just sort of our customers and where we were kind of heavier or not. So, I think there's a lot that goes into it. So I think, it will be a little bit different for everybody. I think kind of each modality might be different as well. So cell culture media might be different from chromatography and filtration. So, I think all of those things combined sort of, are what we're seeing. I think everybody is going to see it at a different time, and I think you saw that with us in the first half of last year. We were - only down low singles, and I think some other folks were down mid-teens or more, right. So I think, there is going to be a little bit of a lag in timing. Could - to your second question, could we see a V? I mean it's possible, but we did not want to kind of model that in for a lack of a better - we don't have enough confidence right now. We have not seen it in the order book of enough magnitude and duration, to be able to call a turn of a V-shaped recovery. Is it possible? Sure. Anything is possible. But if we see that, we obviously would talk about it. But we're going to exit the year here at high single-digits from a high single-digit plus, frankly, as we exit the year. And if we do better than this forecast that, we have here of in the nines, that will have obviously an impact on - at some point the exit trajectory. I suspect it depends on when it happens. Specifically if it happens earlier, I think it would have an impact. But again, we're not planning for it. When we see it, we will obviously update and let people know. But for this guide, it is - you're trying to be transparent with everybody. That's what we're expecting, or what we're guys planning for. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Rainer Blair : Good morning. Puneet Souda : Yes hi, yes thanks, Rainer. My first question - I'm tempted to ask about bioprocessing, but let me stick with instrumentation first. Could you tell us what you're expecting for growth in instrumentation in 2024? And maybe if you could provide some context on the instrumentation recovery, and when can we potentially start to see that at a normalized sort of growth level? Rainer Blair : We think, our life science instrumentation business will, for the year, be down low single-digits. And that's based really on a softer first half of the year and then slow, but persistent improvement here in the second half of the year. What are some of the drivers of that? Well, first of all, here in the first half, we are looking at some pretty significant comps. You will recall the China loan program in particular in the first half of last year, put us into mid to high-teens growth. And of course, at the current activity levels, that will result in a softer first half here. We also talked about the fact that pharma, biopharma, are constraining their investment a bit more along the lines of just recently having changed out, their installed base, taking advantage of additional dollars available during the pandemic and normalizing here as we get through the first half of the year. If we think geographically, China remains weak and we don't expect that to improve here. If anything, that will be a second half of the year dynamic. So life science is starting to stabilize really at the activity levels of the second half of last year. We expect that to continue through the first and then see gradual improvement here in the second half of the year, also from a comp perspective. Puneet Souda : Got it. That's helpful. And then on Abcam, could you update us on the DBS efforts there? And what are you seeing in terms of the RU antibodies markets and expectations that you have for sort of Abcam in '24? And lastly, if I could just ask about after the Veralto spin, how are you thinking about capital deployment overall? Thank you. Rainer Blair : So, first of all, Abcam, we couldn't be more pleased than having closed that early here in December. They had a good finish to the year and we are working with the team and we're up and running. And of course, you can imagine the DBS implementation is proceeding, in a focused way where the team is really pulling. So Abcam is on the way. Then as it relates to capital deployment, you heard my comments earlier around our balance sheet optionality, which is strong, we believe, differentiated. And post the Veralto spin, we'll continue, as we always have, to work on deploying that capital to strengthen our portfolio and continue to be active as always. Puneet Souda : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks. John Bedford : Thanks, Todd. Everyone, we're around for follow-ups. Have a good rest of the day. Thanks. Operator : This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Michael Ryskin : Everyone will kick things off for our next session. My name is Mike Ryskin. I'm on the Bank of America Life Science Tools and Diagnostics teams and I'm thrilled to host Danaher and I'm joined by Rainer Blair, CEO. Rainer, thanks so much for coming. Rainer Blair : Mike, thanks for having us. Michael Ryskin : We'll do a fireside chat as usual, but just kick things off. You reported 1Q a couple of weeks ago, first name out of the gate, set the tone for tools. Pretty impressive quarter, good start to the year. Anything you want to call out, any opening remarks you want to make? Rainer Blair : We did have a good start to the year and it started really with our top line performance. We contracted only 4% versus our guide of high single digits and delivered very strong operating margins of 30%, which also exceeded our guide. All that, of course, drove a very strong cash flow of $1.4 billion for the quarter. So, we're gratified and encouraged by the start to the year and look forward to the rest of the year as it develops. Q - Michael Ryskin : So, first question, obligatory, has to be about bioprocessing. A lot of debate there, a lot of focus there. Decline was high teens, but slightly better than expected. You had a nice sequential improvement in book-to-bill, order growth. So, could you give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the bioprocess end markets, inventory destocking, and just sort of visibility over the last couple quarters? Rainer Blair : We did have a moderate beat here versus our expectations in bioprocessing. What we found particularly encouraging was the sequential orders growth of mid single digits. Typically, when we go from Q4 to Q1 of any year, we see a decline in orders, but we thought it was noteworthy and encouraging that we saw a mid single digit growth here in the sequential orders development. I think another point which was encouraging in the quarter for bioprocessing is that our book-to-bill moved from the prior quarter's book-to-bill, which was around 0.8, 0.85, to in the first quarter of this year, 0.95. So that's encouraging. That's a significant step up there. But in addition to that, we also saw a reduction in cancellation requests. In fact, they weren't significant at all. And you'll recall in prior quarters, we have been trying to ensure that we improve the quality of the signal-to-noise ratio, in other words, the visibility to our customers' ordering patterns by allowing for these cancellations. And it's a signal to the positive that those cancellations are no longer significant. Now as it relates to the inventory destocking, for us, we believe that we'll largely be behind -- have the destocking behind us here at the end of the second quarter. And what's driving that really are in North America and in Europe, the large pharma and CDMO customers who are increasingly returning to their normal ordering patterns. And that's encouraging because we're starting to get that regular order traffic. And those customers are clearly with that signaling that they have come into an inventory equilibrium. And that supports our hypothesis there. Now as we think about the Biotech segment, which represents about 10% to 15% of our business in bioprocessing. We have seen the improvement of the funding levels. And they're just above, I would say, the 2019 levels now after the peak between the two years here. And that's also an encouraging signal, but it's a little too early to see that have an effect right now in order rates. It typically takes two, three quarters before we start seeing that improved funding level play out in actual orders. And lastly, I would say China, China remains as we have forecast at a low activity level and is not really contributing from a tail or headwind. It is as we have projected and guided with a relatively low level of activity. Michael Ryskin : Okay. That's all really helpful context. I think one of the things we've noticed in the last couple quarters, last year, is that between yourselves and Sartorius and Merck KGaA and Avantor and Repligen and Thermo, everyone's got slightly different book to bills. Everyone got slightly different order trends, seasonality, pacing. How would you characterize high level, where your portfolio stacks up versus the others? And what should we keep in mind when we're making those read-throughs from company to company? Rainer Blair : So, there's a couple things to consider when comparing companies. First of all, everybody has slight differences in how they calculate a book-to-bill. So that's sort of one point. The second point would be that there are differences in the portfolios. For instance, at Danaher, we have the broadest and deepest portfolio in bioprocessing. And as you think about our product mix, that will be different than any given other player. And then the geographic and customer mix is also different. So that will lead to different patterns in the recovery. But I would say the large picture, if we take a step back, is actually fairly consistent. It appears that the industry is seeing a slow and gradual recovery here through the first half of the year with an expectation that things get better here in the second half, certainly off of the basis of easier comps, but also because we have largely put the destocking issue behind us. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And most of those comments, I think, really touch on the short term. But can we think about bioprocessing longer term? I think as you exit this year, you talked about mid single digit, high single digit growth or better. That sets you up well for 2025. So, when we think about the long-term bioprocess algorithm, what's your latest view on underlying market demand and just sort of how sustainable is that growth? Rainer Blair : That's right, Michael. So, we are saying that in the second half in bioprocessing, we'll see mid to high single digits with an exit rate of high single digits or better. And that supports our long-term thesis that the bioprocessing market really is growing at high single digits. And that's our expectation here for the long-term. 2025 is a ways away for us yet. We want to make sure that we deliver what we have to do in 2024. But our long-term hypothesis remains intact. And that's really based on a number of supporting factors. If we think about the lower penetration, relatively speaking, of biologic drugs around the world and the opportunity to reach more patients with different approaches such as biosimilars. If we think about the size and the speed of development in the development funnel with the various types of modalities, certainly monoclonal antibodies, but also different proteins such as ADCs, bispecifics, and then, of course, nucleic acids as they make their way into the therapeutic arsenal for clinicians. So, all of that we view as very positive and supportive of our long-term hypothesis. Michael Ryskin : And you don't think -- just to be clear, you don't think there's been any change in competitive dynamics over the last year in terms of market share, market gains and losses. You don't think there's really any new entrants that have popped up in the space. When we go into 2025, it will still be relatively similar market to what it was pre-inventory glut. Rainer Blair : By and large, there have been small share shifts. We believe that we're a beneficiary of those. Of course, there are always new entrants with new ideas and innovations at the margin. But if we view the large picture here, essentially the industry structure and hypothesis remains intact and we view ourselves as a determinant player in that industry. Michael Ryskin : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe shifting away from bioprocess specifically, let's talk about the biopharma end market. You touched briefly on biotech funding and emerging biotech and sort of early funding levels in 1Q and how that will play out. Let's talk about large pharma. I think broadly the comments were that 1Q was a little bit slow out of the gate. Could you expand on that a little bit in terms of budget releases and how have things trended in terms of conversations through March and April? Rainer Blair : So, large pharma for us actually was not slow out of the gate here in the first quarter. In fact, as we look at prescription rates here from 2018 forward, we continue to see in biologics a growth rate of 9%, 10%. And that is sustained here. And we actually believe a net of any inventory correction that we're starting to see that demand signal, more of it certainly in the first quarter. And we would expect to see more of it as we go through the year. So, there are a number of things that are going on in big pharma. But what one has to see as the key takeaway is that the pace of innovation in large pharma has never been faster. The investments and the bets that are being made have never been larger or more exciting. And all of that speaks well not only to what clinicians will have to treat patients around the world, but for the industry's health as a whole. So, we're very bullish on the long-term future here and how large pharma plays out in the long-term. Michael Ryskin : What about factors like IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act? I mean, that's been a hotly debated topic for the past year. Are you seeing any changes tied to that? I know it's still years away. Rainer Blair : Well, it's a little early for there to be an impact. But as we tease apart the different elements that are applicable to us, I think the first thing to note is that biologic drugs versus small molecule drugs are treated differently in the IRA. Biologic drugs receive protection, relatively speaking, for 12 years and small molecules for five years. And so, as you think that through, while that's perhaps shorter than it has been, it actually advantages the development of biologic drugs going forward as they would have longer protection. Secondly, should the pricing of these drugs be lower through Medicare or other programs? The expectation would be that the volume of the prescription and the consumption of those drugs to patients who need them would increase. And of course, our business is volume-driven. So, as the production of these drugs increases in volume, whether as a result of the IRA or whether because a biosimilar has been launched, that's a net positive for the tools industry and of course, as we're the largest player in bioprocessing, certainly for us as well. Michael Ryskin : Okay. That's helpful. And then, sort of sticking on pharma, but maybe expanding things a little bit, let's talk about instrumentation. It's a small part of your business. It's not the biggest needle mover, but still instrumentation was a little bit challenged in the quarter. Again, you saw relatively similar commentary from some of your peers. How should we think about instruments recovering or progressing as you go through the year? Rainer Blair : So, what we've seen in the instrument business, and recall our instrument business is about 10% of our total business. So, as you suggested, it's not our largest segment. But nonetheless, what we have seen here, and we've called it out some time ago, is really a normalization process of an industry which is typically a mid single digit growing industry. And what we've seen in the past through subsidies, whether they be in China or by other countries in various different forms, is the pull forward of demand. And what we're seeing now is really the overhang of that pull forward as this industry normalizes. We would say this is still in the earlier stages of that normalization process, but expect to start seeing improvements in the second half, not only because of better or easier comps, but also because we would expect the activity level to return here as pharma companies and other researchers and applied markets start replacing their installed base and getting back to a normal rhythm. Michael Ryskin : And are you seeing any difference across your portfolio? You've got exposure there from Leica, from Beckman, from Sciex. Any parts of the business doing a little bit better than others? And sort of what differentiates that? Rainer Blair : I would say what we see, and this is to be seen as a nuance as opposed to a large trend, is that the larger scientific instruments that are really about pushing scientific inquiry forward at the leading edge of science are doing better than those that are more the traditional lab workhorses where there's still, I would say, some opportunity for improved growth going forward. But we're not there yet. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. That's helpful. Next, I want to run through a couple specific business segments. Let's start with Cepheid. Business did really well in 1Q, but then again, it's done very, very well for a number of quarters in a row. It's been a number of years since you closed that deal. If you could just sort of take a step back and evaluate where Cepheid was when you brought it in versus what it is now. What really has driven that outperformance? Rainer Blair : This is an acquisition, certainly for the history books. We're working every day, of course, to put others in there. And there's a couple other examples. But Cepheid truly is an extraordinary example of that. And really, the acquisition was about acquiring an outstanding team, first and foremost, that had developed a differentiated technology that is defensible and that delivers, first and foremost, real clinical value. The secret sauce of Cepheid's success is tied directly to the value it offers to clinicians to help their patients. And so, of course, as Cepheid entered Danaher, we helped Cepheid to become more profitable and with that profitability to be able to reinvest more in the business. And with that, we're then able to fully take advantage of the pandemic with our installed base now post-pandemic being more than two and a half times the size it was prior to the pandemic. We've invested significantly in R&D and the assay development flywheel that we drive there and that has us now with 30-plus approved assays in the U.S., with 40-plus approved assays outside of the U.S. And those are delivering differentiated value in various care settings. At the point-of-care, where doctors are making calls about therapeutics. I was asked just the other day about the 4-in-1 test and why it is such a popular respiratory test solution. And you'll recall the 4-in-1 is for Flu A, Flu B, RSV, and COVID. And the reason is that when a patient presents with flu-like symptoms, it's really a crapshoot as to what this patient has. And ultimately, with the 4-in-1 test, the doctor is not only able to identify what it is not, it specifically identifies what the ailment is and allows a therapeutic decision. And this is done with ease-of-use. This is done at a short turnaround time and its high performance, meaning it's the right answer. And that combination has really been attractive to hospital systems and clinicians throughout the world and really defines how Cepheid continues to move forward and take share. Michael Ryskin : So, with all that being said, where does Cepheid go next? You talked about the massive growth in the install base. You talked about the menu expansion. Margins have really taken a huge leap forward. So, what's your view of Cepheid over the next couple of years? Rainer Blair : We're going to continue to take share. There's plenty of opportunity for share gain, not just in respiratory testing. On the contrary, we have many more tests available. So, we continue with ensuring that the utilization of more menu assays per instrument, as well as introducing additional assays. And then, of course, we still have the opportunity of geographic expansion. So, we're going to continue to invest in the right clinical decision-making for the hospital systems and doctors out there by providing them this outstanding solution. Michael Ryskin : So, net-net, above company growth, margin accretive at this point, right? Rainer Blair : So, we think the long-term growth rate of the non-respiratory business is in the low double-digits. That is above the fleet's growth rate, which we believe to be high single digits. And this is a very profitable business at scale and will contribute and be accretive to the fleet average. Michael Ryskin : Okay. A couple of other assets I want to touch on real quick. Aldevron, you acquired that asset a couple of years ago. When you acquired it, I believe $400 million in revenue, growing healthy, healthy double-digits, very strong margins, really positioned you for nucleic acids, cell and gene therapy, some of the new modalities, so affiliated with bioprocessing. Could you give us an update on that deal, how that's fared since the acquisition post? Rainer Blair : So, first, when we acquired it, it was more like $250 million in revenues. But nonetheless, it has continued to grow at very attractive growth rates here and is meeting our expectations. As you would expect, there's a bit of a tail post-COVID here for Aldevron as they were involved in the manufacture of various solutions here used during the pandemic. But nonetheless, they are the gold standard as it relates to supplying plasmids and other types of proteins to the gene editing market. And that, of course, is a very interesting market, not just today, but for the very long-term. And that was the principal reason for us making that acquisition to ensure that we not only had a beachhead, but a gold standard for the development of gene editing solutions going forward. Michael Ryskin : And then your most recent acquisition was Abcam, just closed in December. So, you've had it for a total of maybe five months now, but you've already taken some early steps in terms of integrating that and sort of taking it down the road of becoming a Danaher OpCo. So, give us an update on how that deal is going. Rainer Blair : So, early days. We closed in December as you mentioned, and we just also closed on our first quarter with ownership there. We've installed a Danaher President and CFO so that they start playing out the playbook that we put together here during diligence, which is specifically tailored to Abcam and the opportunities there to both accelerate growth and improve the cost position. So, it's early days, but we believe certainly that this really another gold standard company that is really the standard in proteomic research reagents is going to meet its high single digit long-term growth rate. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. And where I'm going with these questions is, Cepheid, Aldevron, Abcam, we kind of talked about Cytiva when we talked about bioprocessing. You take all these together and Danaher exiting COVID, exiting 2024 is going to look like a very, very different company than it looked like in 2016, '17, '18. The last couple of years between COVID and inventory stocking, it's really obscured the underlying performance of the company. So, taking all of that together, how would you characterize, what are we going to be looking at in the next couple of years going forward in terms of the new, new Danaher? Rainer Blair : You're right. The fog of the pandemic has obscured the true power and the rerating of both our growth and earnings trajectory post-pandemic. And just to give you a sense of the power of this transformation, if we just sort of take 2018 as a base year prior to the pandemic, and we look to the end of 2023, we're a $20 billion company that was a mid single digit grower with low 20s operating margins. And since then, we have spun off in different forms over $7 billion of our revenue and nearly replaced it through other acquisitions. What we spun off Envista as well as Veralto, which was just in last October had dilutive growth and earnings profiles. And what we acquired had accretive growth and earnings profiles. And of course, our acquisitions were the GE biopharma business, which we've since combined with the Pall Life Sciences business to form Cytiva. And you all know that as being the premier franchise in bioprocessing in the world, we acquired Aldevron and Abcam both once again accretive to both growth and earnings. And those each gave us a beachhead in genomic medicines as well as proteomic research. And then lastly, if you think about how the respiratory testing market has developed back in 2018, roughly we were a $250 million respiratory testing business. And if you think about where we are today in an endemic state, we're well over a $1 billion. We've talked about $1.6 billion here in the guide for 2024. And we believe that to be a sustainable level of respiratory testing. So, when you put all that together, you're looking at a $24 billion business that is dialed into the most attractive segments in the life science industry with a high single digit long-term growth rate, a margin profile, so VCM of 35% to 40%. You all are familiar with our operating system, the Danaher Business System. That allows us to drive cash flow above our net income. And all of that, of course, then allows us to execute on M&A and capital allocation in general. And that's what ultimately drives that earnings accretion of double-digit EPS growth. So, when you see all of this, you can see that our objective to exit the pandemic stronger than entering it, we believe that's been achieved. And as the fog continues to rise here and the pandemic gets further and further into the rearview mirror, you're going to start seeing that portfolio play itself out. Michael Ryskin : Okay. You just touched on it there in terms of the earnings accretion and the operating leverage, but I want to touch on that a little bit more. Given the business shift, given where you're seeing the fastest growth opportunities in Cepheid and bioprocess, those are really accretive incremental margins. You've got really high-volume leverage. So, as the business recovers exiting this year, as you look forward to 2025, how should we think about that incremental flow through to the bottom line? Rainer Blair : So that flow through, of course, as we've been contracting, was very high on the negative side, but you can expect that we've done a lot of work on the cost side during the pandemic. We have not sat idly by here and we've taken full advantage of this time to continue to drive our fixed cost base down to be able to benefit from the volume leverage, which we expect over time. So that's going to be a very attractive incremental flow through as volumes recover going forward. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Just a couple minutes left, so I want to make sure we touch on capital deployment at M&A. As you said, you just did Abcam last year, but given your free cash flow, given your balance sheet, you could probably do an Abcam sized deal every year, if not more. So, your balance sheet remains really robust, free cash flow strong. There's a lot of opportunities out there. So, how would you characterize your appetite for M&A now or for other capital deployment? Rainer Blair : Well, we are skewed in our thinking. We have a bias, if you will, towards M&A with our cash flow and that remains unchanged. But we do have to say that the current environment with high interest rates and high valuations are such that it makes it, of course, more difficult. The one thing that we're not going to compromise is our discipline around return expectations on acquisitions. And what that likely means in the shorter term is that we're more likely to do smaller bolt-ons and medium sized deals, which for a company of our size, $25 billion roughly revenue, continues and will continue to move the needle. So, to give you a sense, you used Abcam as an example that adds 2% to our growth in one year. And of course, if we hadn't done the spins of past and we were much larger, say nearly double, of course, that would be only half that growth rate and it becomes much harder to move the needle. So lastly, to the topic of other forms of capital allocation, we always look at all types of capital allocation. And we do that, of course, in relation to the alternatives that we have and on the basis of return on invested capital. So, we have a bias towards M&A, but of course, we always see what other alternatives we might have in capital allocation. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And talking about the M&A angle, could you talk us through your framework in terms of how you consider targets? What's the roadmap you take when you're evaluating something? Rainer Blair : So, this is the way we operate. First of all, we get out of bed in the morning and are canvassing markets essentially 24x7 with our teams to understand markets and to understand companies. And it's on the basis of our strategy, which is to apply science and technology to improve human health, that we set a frame and then look for those markets that have the most attractive long-term secular growth drivers. We're not talking about three years. We're not talking about five years. We're talking about 10-plus years of strong secular growth that supports an investment hypothesis. Then within that, we, of course, look for the most attractive targets. And in that case, we try to develop a proprietary perspective on any given asset to see whether it has a competitive advantage, value, reserves that we might mine or that we can expand, leveraging our experience in the Danaher Business System in order to improve that asset. And then, of course, in parallel to that, the financial model has to work. We will not compromise on our earnings metrics and return on invested capital and our cash flow expectations. Michael Ryskin : Great. I think if you if you frame it that way, you think back between Cytiva, Cepheid, Abcam and Aldevron, they all check the box in terms of long-term secular growth, company-specific advantage, valuation. So, it's a clear way of thinking about it. We got about a minute left. So, just sort of our last concluding question is the standard. Danaher has pretty well understood and pretty well followed, but is there anything that you think is still underappreciated? Is there anything that people misunderstand or misinterpret? Sort of what are the questions you're getting that you want to clarify? Rainer Blair : I would just say it comes back to this fog lifting. We have done a -- I believe, a tremendous amount of work to transform our portfolio and position this company with a competitive advantage, not just in terms of the kinds of companies that we have and the technologies that we use to innovate within any given segment, but also with the Danaher Business System and our teams. We just believe that this is a really unique company. The combination of those markets that we operate in, the lighthouse, leading assets that we own in those markets, the tried and true Danaher Business System, which allows us to execute at scale for nearly 40 years now, nearly 40 years now. This is -- that's unique. It's our culture along with the tool set on how we operate and drive improved performance. And then lastly, I believe we bring a discipline to the market with how we operate that is truly differentiated and it shows in our cash flow. If you compare our cash flow to other companies in the sector or elsewhere, it truly does identify where the real power and multiplier is of the Danaher Business System and our portfolio. End of Q&A: Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks so much. And with that, we're out of time. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Mike. Michael Ryskin : Rainer, appreciate it. Rainer Blair : Appreciate it. Thank you. Michael Ryskin : Thank you, everyone. Rainer Blair : Thank you, everybody.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer M. Blair: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our team executed well during the second quarter, delivering better than expected revenue, earnings, and cash flow. We were particularly pleased with the sustained positive momentum in our bioprocessing business, and with the strong performance of Cepheid, which we believe gained market share in molecular testing again this quarter. Now across the portfolio, market conditions were largely as we anticipated. In our bioprocessing business, conditions in the U.S. and Europe continued to improve, and we were encouraged to see orders increase high single digits sequentially this quarter. In China, bioprocessing demand and underlying activity levers were stable sequentially, but remained weak as customers continued to manage liquidity. In Life Sciences, capital equipment investments remained constrained while recurring revenue was relatively stable. And in Diagnostics, we saw healthy demand globally across our businesses. As we move through this transitional period, we believe Danaher is well positioned for sustainable long-term value creation. Our strong positioning and attractive end markets coupled with durable, high-recurring revenue business models, and the power of the Danaher business system supports our long-term expectations of high single-digit core revenue growth with a differentiated margin and cash flow profile. So with that, let's take a closer look at our second quarter 2024 results. Sales were $5.7 billion in the second quarter and core revenue declined 3.5%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were down low single digits with strength across Diagnostics offset by declines in Biotechnology and Life Sciences. High growth markets declined high single digits, including a high-teens decline in China. Our growth profit margin for the second quarter was 59.7% and our adjusted operating profit margin of 27.3% was up 60 basis points as the favorable impact of cost savings initiatives more than offset lower volume. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.72 were essentially flat year-over-year. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2.6 billion a year-to-date, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 129%. Now additionally, through the second quarter and into July, we repurchased approximately 19 million shares. While M&A remains our bias for capital deployment, we believe these repurchases will provide an attractive return given the strength of our long-term organic growth, earnings, and cash flow outlook. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our biotechnology segment declined 7% with the bioprocessing business down high single digits and the discovery and medical business down mid-single digits. In our bioprocessing business, revenue declines moderated from the first quarter as we believe our larger customers in the U.S. and Europe have worked through the majority of their excess inventories and are returning to normal ordering patterns. Many of these customers are also seeing strong momentum for therapeutics in their late stage pipelines, which is promising for our future growth. Our emerging biotech customers continue to prioritize projects, particularly for cell and gene therapies in an effort to manage liquidity. However, we are encouraged by the improvement in the overall funding environment, which is a positive leading indicator for these customers. So based on the trends we saw through the first half of the year, we continue to expect a low single digit core revenue decline in our bioprocessing business for the full year of 2024. There is also no change to our assumption of a bioprocessing core revenue growth rate of high single digits or better as we exit the year. Biologics market remains very healthy as evidenced by the increasing number of treatments both in development and production. Notably, the number of new FDA approvals for biologic and genomic medicines in the first half of this year nearly doubled compared to the first half of 2023, and the full year 2024 is on track to set a new record. Underlying demand for biologic medicines also remains on track to grow at a high single digit or better rate again for the full year 2024. So given this substantial and sustained increase in approvals and production volumes, we expect the growth rate in bioprocessing to remain very robust for many years to come. We continue to make substantial investments in innovation to support our customers as they pursue these life-changing therapeutics. To support monoclonal antibody production, which comprises the majority of our bioprocessing revenues, Cytiva expanded its comprehensive filtration portfolio with the launch of Supor Prime. Now Supor Prime filters are specifically designed to address key challenges associated with high concentration biologic drugs whose complex formulations and high particle loads make them prone to premature filter blockage and costly drug product losses. We're also developing innovative solutions for emerging modalities. In May, Cytiva introduced the Cepheid Cell Therapy manufacturing platform, which is helping address critical cost and capacity constraints associated with CAR-T Cell Therapy manufacturing. The Cepheid platforms fully automated manufacturing process can increase productivity by up to 50% per year compared to the industry standard, reducing our customers' costs and increasing throughput. Addressing these key manufacturing challenges, will help improve patient access and facilitate wider adoption of these important therapeutics. Now, turning to our Life Sciences segment, core revenue decreased by 5.5%. Core revenue in our Life Sciences Instrument businesses collectively declined high single digits as expected, with trends in the second quarter largely consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Global pharma and biotech demand remained weak, academic markets were weaker sequentially, and applied markets performed comparatively better, particularly for our advanced solutions which provide critical capabilities needed by our customers. In China, we're seeing improving sales models and coding activity driven by the recently announced stimulus measures. However, we don't anticipate this to convert to orders until 2025, as these programs are in early stages of implementation. So in the meantime, many customers are delaying purchasing decisions as they await funding. Now, last month at the American Society of Mass Spectrometry Meeting, SCIEX reinforced their market leadership in Quantitative Mass Spectrometry with the release of the 7,500-plus triple-quad mass spectrometer. The 7,500-plus pairs the ultra-high sensitivity of the 7,500 with faster acquisition speeds and the ability to maintain the highest sensitivity quantitation and the ability to maintain the highest sensitivity quantitation for up to twice as many sample runs. This makes the 7,500 plus particularly well-suited for complex applications such as PFAS analysis where customers need to test more samples across diverse sample types with high precision to meet challenging new regulations. In our genomics consumables business, core revenue declined mid-single digits in the quarter. High-single digit growth in gene writing and editing solutions was more than offset by declines in next generation sequencing and the impact of project timing in our plasmids business. During the quarter, IDT opened a new manufacturing facility at their Coreville, Iowa campus which enabled the team to manufacture differentiated new offerings such as rapid gene synthesis. This is the second facility expansion for IDT within the last 12 months and provides the capacity needed to support the rapidly expanding global DNA synthesis market and related drug development activities. Now moving over to our Diagnostic segment, core revenue increased 3%. Our Clinical Diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid-single digit core revenue growth led by high-single digit growth at Radiometer. Leica Biosystems was up mid-single digits with notable strengths in digital pathology driven by a Aperio GT 450 diagnostics digital pathology slide scanner which recently received its FDA 510K clearance. Beckman Colter Diagnostics was up low single digits with balanced strengths across both developed and high growth markets. Now in May Beckman received FDA 510K clearance of its Access NT ProBNP on the DxI 9000 immunoassay analyzer. This important expansion of Beckman's cardiac testing menu allows clinicians to quickly and accurately diagnose and assess the condition severity of patients suspected of having acute heart failure. Now this clearance is just the latest confirmation of the DxI 9000 platform\u2019s capability to develop increasingly more sensitive and clinically relevant diagnostics. In molecular diagnostics, Cepheid\u2019s respiratory revenue of approximately $300 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $200 million driven by both higher volumes and a favorable mix of our 4-in-1 tests for COVID-19, Flu A and B and RSV. So we continue to expect respiratory revenue of approximately $1.6 billion for the full year 2024. Now as I mentioned earlier, we believe the Cepheid team continued to gain market share during the quarter. Increasing menu adoption and system utilization helped drive mid-teens growth in our core non-respiratory reagent portfolio, including more than 20% growth in sexual health and virology assays. We also continued to expand our nearly 60,000 system installed base as many existing healthcare systems and integrated delivery network customers are adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to patients. In June, the FDA granted Cepheid marketing authorization for its Hepatitis C RNA test. Hepatitis C diagnosis has traditionally been a multi-step process requiring follow-up appointments and leading to treatment delays. With Cepheid's tests, which is the first molecular-based point of care test for Hepatitis C, patients can be tested and receive treatment during the same healthcare visit. So this is a great example of how bringing accurate, easy to use molecular testing closer to patients is improving treatment outcomes and driving long-term growth at Cepheid. Now before we move on to our expectations for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our recently released 2024 Sustainability Report, which detailed several important milestones across the three pillars of our sustainability program. Starting with building the best team, innovating products that improve lives and our planet, and protecting our environment. Notably, we have committed to setting science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the science-based target initiative, including reaching net zero value chain emissions by 2050. So I encourage you all to read through the report to learn more about the depth and scope of Danaher\u2019s commitment to sustainability and the important work we're doing to make a positive, holistic impact on the world around us. So now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year 2024. In the third quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the low single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect a third-quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26%. For the full year 2024, there is no change to our previous guidance. As a reminder, we anticipate a core revenue decline in the low single-digit percent range and a full-year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with our better-than-expected second quarter results and are encouraged by the continued momentum in our bioprocessing business. Our strong performance is a testament to our team and their commitment to innovating and executing with the Danaher business system. And they have done a tremendous job navigating the current environment to support our customers' life-changing work today, while also delivering breakthrough innovation that is reinforcing our long-term competitive advantage. The transformation in our portfolio over the last several years has created a focused Life Sciences and Diagnostic leader positioned for higher long-term growth, expanded margins, and stronger cash flow. And our recent share repurchases reflect our conviction in a bright future ahead for Danaher. So looking ahead, the unique combination of our incredibly talented team, the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, and a leading financial profile provides us with a strong foundation to create sustainable, long-term shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call back to John. John Bedford : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. We're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. And Rainer I appreciate all the color on Bioprocessing. Two follow-ups. First is on the consumables. Can you elaborate on what's giving you the confidence that the stock is drawing to a conclusion here? And then on the capital equipment side, just thoughts on how long this will remain depressed, when you might start to see some improvement there? Rainer M. Blair: So Jack, on the consumable side, we've really seen ordering patterns back to normal with very, very few exceptions and with pretty clear visibility through the measures that we put in place to stay close to our customers here during the destocking period. We feel that we're very close to normal order patterns. And keep in mind, we actively monitor our customers on a customer-by-customer basis. And in addition to that, we really took active measures here to ensure that inventories were normalized. And you'll recall that we took decisions to ensure that we took the dysfunction in the supply chain out to ensure that we had a true demand signal. And we think that's paid off here, and we know where our customers sit in terms of their stock levels on consumables. Now equipment is a slightly different picture. We're seeing good activity there at some of our larger customers, and that played out here in the second quarter as well, with the sequential order growth being high single digits and being positive for both equipment and consumables. And so, those larger customers really do have a higher activity level, whereas the smaller customers probably remain a little bit more constrained. Jack Meehan : Awesome. And then, we're just trying to piece together the mosaic here. So your bioprocessing orders increased high single digits when your peers declined sequentially. I think there's a lot of plausible explanations being thrown around for why the results in the quarter diverged. I was just curious if you could weigh in on what you think is the right signal, what's the noise? Rainer M. Blair: Well, from a competitive perspective, Jack, everyone has slightly different positioning, whether it's by product category or geography or even customer type. Now, if you look at us, we're probably the broadest and the deepest in terms of our portfolio, both upstream and downstream, while some others are perhaps a little bit more concentrated. So, given that, it's always going to be hard to really line up the various players in the industry to have a perfect read-across. But again, the good news here is that this is a great business, and it's recovering as we expected, and we're confident about the future. Jack Meehan : Excellent. Thank you. Rainer M. Blair: Thanks, Jack. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. Hey, good morning, you guys, and thanks for taking the questions. So another one here just on bioprocessing. So on the 3Q guidance, can you just walk us through what's contemplated in 3Q guide, we've seen a few quarters of sequential progression on orders during the last three quarters in a row sequentially. So walk us through how much of this is just seasonality on the step down into 3Q versus is there some conservatism in there? And then also on orders, should we expect seasonality to also impact on the order book for bioprocessing in 3Q as well? Matt McGrew : Yeah. No, I think that's in bioprocessing in particular. We probably should talk about bioprocessing and respiratory for Q3. So if you think about sort of revenue, we've got bioprocessing is going to be down low single digits, which is again kind of a continued improvement versus what we saw in Q1 and Q2. We were down kind of high teens in Q1, high single digits in Q2, and we think that that goes to kind of low single digits here in Q3. Given like Rainer just said, I think we're largely through the destocking sort of on the consumable side. A little bit easier comps in China as well, so that probably helps a little. But if you think about sort of the two big drivers of Q3, outside of even Bioprocessing, when you think about sort of the guide in totality, you have two issues or two things to think about. We've got lower volume in Biotechnology like I just talked about and in respiratory as well. So Biotechnology prior to the pandemic, we sort of had sort of a step down between Q2 and Q3 seasonally. That was always the case for the business and we're kind of monitoring -\u2013 we're putting that in sequentially again here in our guide. We were about down mid-single digits prior to the pandemic from a revenue perspective. And so, that's kind of what we assumed in the guide, that we would have that sort of step down that we normally have seen. Given the fact that we're back at normal order patterns, we sort of believe that we're going to have a normal seasonality as well. So, you kind of factor that in for bioprocessing. And then on respiratory, we're assuming $200 million of revenue versus $300 million here in the quarter. So, the two of those kind of combined are the reason that you've got the Q3 revenue where it is. And I might also add, just to kind of get out in front of them, maybe the next question on margins, that's a big reason why we're kind of guiding to approximately 26% adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Those two businesses sort of being a little bit lower sequentially here, given their margin profile, that's the big driver, if not the full driver of what's happening on the margin perspective as well. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great, thanks. And then my follow-up here, just on 2025, there's been a lot of noise across the industry on 2025 and where we'll be at from an underlying market growth standpoint as well. So, you reiterated exiting this year in bioprocessing at high single digits or above, but could you just walk us through how are you thinking about the total business in terms of 2025 in relation to that underlying market? And then you've also talked a lot about the incremental margins on bioprocessing and some of that durability on the margin expansion and diagnostics as well. So, Street's currently at $8.70 or so in EPS $1.25, how are you feeling about that number, any early takes there would be helpful? Thanks. Matt McGrew : Yeah. We just finished the second quarter year of 2024, so we still have a lot of work left to do in 2024 before we think about 2025. We have always sort of guided here in January. I think that is still the plan. Plenty of work left to do here in the quarter from a top-line perspective, but clearly we are seeing the improvements. We thought clearly, this is playing out, at least in bioprocessing, like we thought on the top line. And so, maybe what we should do is let's just get through Q3 here, and then we can kind of revisit the fourth quarter and 2025 as we get there. From a margin perspective, I think we have sort of historically talked, both -- like I talked on the last call, Q4 and Q1 will typically be better margin quarters for us, given like you said, the operating leverage that we get out of bioprocessing and respiratory, I don't think that, that will be any different here in this year. But as far as over the long term, as I think about next year from a margin perspective, we've talked about this business being a 35% to 40% kind of incremental fall through. I don't see any reason why that would not be the case, especially as we sort of return to growth in bioprocessing. I think we've been close to those levels here as we've been shrinking, frankly. So I think we've done a lot on the cost structure to be able to make sure that we can continue to do that. But I think over time, 35%, 40% fall through, and this is a business in a normal time that our adjusted operating margin should be in the low 30s. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Rainer M. Blair: Good morning Scott. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning Rainer and Matt and John. The buyback, I don't recall seeing one at least one of this size in the past. What's -- just a little color, is it maybe a statement that M&A is a little slow or is it -- should you guys think about it as a little bit more like housekeeping, what slow color on how you thought through the buyback? Thanks. Rainer M. Blair: Well Scott, first, it's important to note that this is not a change on our view on capital allocation. So we maintain a strong bias towards M&A, and we're going to continue to be active on the M&A front. Now having said that, as always, we evaluate capital allocation using the same ROIC lens, whether it's M&A, buyback, R&D projects, CAPEX and so forth. So we evaluate all of these investment options based on the expected returns. And specifically in today's environment, the relative value of a buyback generates attractive financial returns. So we're buying a great business, one we know very well. We have strong conviction about its future while maintaining a meaningful M&A envelope. And I put out there this, this is important that our free cash flow is nearly $6 billion and our net leverage is about two turns. So we feel well positioned here with various alternatives. Scott Davis : Makes sense, Rainer. Guys, well the book-to-bill in Cytiva, will that cross 1 in 3Q or maybe said a different way, has it already crossed 1 since we're already a month into the quarter? Rainer M. Blair: Well, our book-to-bill is 0.9, Scott. And as we've said, in order to make our full year guide here of bioprocessing being down low single digits we have to maintain the 0.9. And that's certainly how the first half has played out here, and we're confident that, that will continue to be the case. As you know, we don't guide to book-to-bills or orders, but basically the guide is built on the assumption that as we have 0.9 here for the year, we'll exit our year with high single-digit or better growth. Scott Davis : Thanks a lot Rainer, thank you guys. Appreciate it. Rainer M. Blair: Thanks Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi Rainer. Good morning to you and congrats on a nice finish here. One, maybe a high level on -- maybe talk about the competitive pricing environment. Any change, I think where I'm going with the question is given the mix it signals from different players, there is some fear whether competitive pricing environment could be great, so maybe talk about what you're seeing in the market? Rainer M. Blair: Vijay, look for the second quarter, all up for Danaher, our pricing was up 100 basis points right around there. And for 2024 as a whole, we think we will likely be a little above our historical average of 75 to 100 basis points. So we feel good about our positioning, the leverage in our portfolio, and how we've positioned here price-wise. Matt McGrew : As far as -- I think you're probably referring to bioprocessing price, Vijay. We did about 2.5% here in the quarter. It's probably a pretty good marker for the full year. We were getting better price in the last couple of years, probably 4%, 5% type price, but that was also in an environment where we had supply chain and other challenges from an inflationary perspective that we're getting more price to offset some of that. So some of those concerns sort of fall off, if you will, the price comes down. But fundamentally, from a competitive perspective, I don't think we're seeing significant price pressures. It's much more a function of just coming back to where we used to be, which is in bioprocessing, 100 to 200 basis points. Vijay Kumar : Okay. That's helpful, Matt. Rainer, one more and a bigger picture on China. What's been the historical relationship between code activity and when that translates to orders and revenues, is there any way to quantify when you say China code activity has picked up, is that above trend versus historical averages above trend, any framework would be helpful? Rainer M. Blair: Sure. Well, in China, what we're seeing is increased activity levels in our funnel. So the volumes that we see in our funnel has been growing and that's all related to people in the market getting ready for this stimulus funding, if you will, with sort of shovel-ready projects. But what we're also seeing is a decrease in the funnel velocity as naturally market players are looking to see what the financing terms and conditions for the stimulus are. So we have watched this development. This is expected for us. This is not new news. We expected that the market would hold up to see what the funding alternatives would be. And we don't expect to see the funnel convert into orders in any meaningful way here in 2024. We view that more as a 2025 event that people are waiting for their shovel-ready projects to receive funding. Vijay Kumar : Understood, thanks guys. Rainer M. Blair: Thanks Vijay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask on Life Sciences segment. I think you flagged instruments still down high single digits. And that's a small part of the business, but it still seems like Life Sciences as a whole isn't seeing a lot of improvement yet. You also called out NGS, I think being a little bit weaker. So some parts of consumables are impacted. So just as a whole for Life Sciences, both instruments and consumables, can you dive a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing in the end market, any improvement in order trends there, just how should we expect the second half to play out? Rainer M. Blair: Sure, Mike. Well, let's start with the quarter. So overall, the second quarter came in, as expected, down high single digits with the market conditions largely consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, with capital equipment more constrained, particularly in China, while consumables and services held up comparatively better. Now in developed markets, pharma and biotech remain soft but stable sequentially, while academic markets were modestly weaker and applied markets continue to hold up well, particularly for more advanced instrumentation that you need for complicated applications such as PFAS, clinical, and so forth. And coming back to China here, and to build on my comments to Vijay's question, the recent stimulus measures are really driving improved funnels and coding activity, but we don't expect that to convert to orders until 2025. So as expected, we're starting to see customers delaying their purchasing decisions there as they await the stimulus funding. Now as you think about the second quarter -- the second half, excuse me, we're going to see the comps easing a bit, and that will certainly contribute to some stabilization. But we would expect this normalization process for Life Science tools and consumables to continue through 2024. Michael Ryskin : Okay. 2025 is it? Rainer M. Blair: Through 2024. Michael Ryskin : The end of 2024, okay, alright, thank you. And then on Cepheid on the Diagnostics side. I mean you talked about respiratory coming in a little bit stronger at $300 million. But the rest of Diagnostics and the rest of major diagnostics specifically, still seem a little bit choppy in the Q you called out a decline in core sales [indiscernible]. So could you talk about what you're seeing in Diagnostics outside of respiratory business? Rainer M. Blair: Sure. We saw mid-single-digit growth in our non-respiratory businesses with good customer activity around the world. And in particular, if you think about Cepheid, both respiratory and non-respiratory reagents were up. So non-respiratory was actually up mid-teens. And here you see the Cepheid strategy playing out, increasing that installed base, increasing menu adoption and utilization; virology, a relatively new assay, up 20% in the second quarter. And we're, of course, benefiting from recent menu expansion such as in sexual health, which is also up 20%. And then you heard us launch the new assay and receive approvals for Hepatitis C, and we look forward to seeing its growth journey going forward. So as you look at Cepheid, that strategy plays out. We continue to take share and grew both in respiratory and non-respiratory testing. We have there a little bit of a year-over-year with equipment being a little bit down and that nudged it just into a small negative growth here for the second quarter. Now as you look at the remaining businesses, Beckman grew low single digits. But really, the Beckman Diagnostics continues with this momentum with recurring revenue growing at mid-single digits again this quarter, and the overall moderation there for Beckman is really related to some challenging equipment comps. We had a lot of backlog that we needed to ship out last year, and that's affecting the compare here a little bit. But Beckman Diagnostics really is a mid-single-digit long-term grower. It's got a full innovation pipeline. The commercial execution is outstanding. We've got great instrument placement. And we've done a lot on the innovation front. We just talked about the Access NT proBNP, which has expanded our cardiac menu in the second quarter. And we've done a full refresh of our product line with the immunoassay DxI 9000; on chemistry, the DxC 500 and in automation, the DxA 5000. So coupled with our execution, we see our diagnostics businesses poised and positioned very well here, both competitively and for the long term. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Daniel Brennan : Hey, great, thanks. Good morning Rainer, how are you doing. And Matt thanks for the questions here. Maybe just going back to Scott's question on the buyback. The Danaher stock has been one of the best performers over the past 5 and 10-year period. So arguably, you could say the ROIC on buybacks was consistently attractive during the period of time. And as mentioned, you guys historically don't really buy back stock and your business model is really predicated on M&A and deploying DBS. So could you just elaborate a bit on the M&A environment today, maybe what's holding things back, and what's your confidence in employing meaningful capital for M&A as we look out over the next few years? Matt McGrew : Yes, Dan, maybe I'll start. I mean, look, we sort of maybe -- maybe this is the way to think about it. We like this portfolio. We like how we're positioned for the future. We like the growth where we're going to be here. The portfolio moves through the last five years have been sort of -- the fog of COVID, if you will, has really sort of made it hard to see what we think this business is capable of. We've talked about it with everybody in the past. I mean this is a high single-digit growth business, 60% gross margins, 30% OP with free cash flow conversion north of 100%. We like our business. And when I see what we trade at, today and then I kind of look out at what some of the still current M&A multiples are, it's just from a return perspective, we're getting as good of a return, if not better, on some of -- on the buyback than we would at some of these levels. And we just think that in today's environment, the buyback made sense. But that is in today's environment. Our bias still is towards M&A, but I do believe that we've got a bit of a disconnect here still in today's environment. And we are kind of making a bet, if you will, on a business that we know well and that we think has got a lot of upside. Daniel Brennan : Great, thanks Matt for that. And maybe just one, if I could just go back to the Q3 guide for Bioprocess and the normal seasonality. Q2 did come in ahead of expectations and you're maintaining the full year guide. So is there anything in Q2 in terms of a pull forward or timing or is there any change to your view that as inventories normalize, which I think you've said in the past, you would see a real nice recovery as I think you guys have talked about the math of seeing like a nice kind of growth rate as things normalize? Matt McGrew : Yes. No, nothing, I would say, for bioprocessing and the same for respiratory. I would say there's nothing that we saw in Q2 that is causing us consternation about the normal seasonality. I think this is really about returning to a normal seasonal pattern, where typically in bioprocessing, we are seeing mid-single-digit decline sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And for planning purposes, because we are largely past destocking and because we see the customer order patterns sort of coming back to normal, for planning purposes we are going to plan on that same mid-single-digit decline from a revenue perspective sequentially, but that does not change anything in the underlying what we've seen in the business. So I wouldn't read too much into it other than this is a sequential normal historical revenue pattern, and we are assuming that in the guidance. Daniel Brennan : Great, thanks Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rainer M. Blair: Hi Doug. Douglas Schenkel : Good morning guys, thanks for taking the questions. First, I got a two parter on bioprocessing, and then I want to pivot back to China. So on bioprocessing, it seems like you need continued improvement in the end market to exit the year growing high single digits, meaning this is more than just year-over-year comparisons. It does seem like you're expecting continued improvement there. Just given how the last couple of years have gone in the market, even acknowledging what you talked about in terms of encouraging trends, I'm just wondering how you got comfortable with any risk to that assumption? So that's the first question. The second is on new modalities. In the near term and then just looking ahead, how has your business associated with new modalities performed recently and what's your expectation for mix, new modalities versus MAB contributions moving forward based on what you're seeing in the market right now, that obviously could be an accelerator to growth over the coming quarters? And then finally, on China, just regarding the slowdown in purchasing related to stimulus -- pending stimulus. I'm just wondering how broad based this is and where you're seeing the most headwinds as folks basically try to get better clarity on where the money is going to be allocated and when? Thank you very much. Rainer M. Blair: Sure. Let's start with how we get comfortable with our view on bioprocessing and its future. And I think it's important to level set one more time on the performance that we've seen here in the first half. Starting with the second quarter which, again, it has played out as we thought. We saw improvement in revenue and orders, second quarter in a row in both consumables and equipment. And you'll recall from our commentary in the last quarter's comments that we wanted to see that improvement in equipment, and we did. And our core revenue improved nearly 1,000 basis points from down high teens, Matt talked about this, to down high single digits. And again, orders grew high single digits sequentially from Q1, which is an acceleration from the mid-single digit. So we do see strength there. And that's because destocking is largely behind us, and there are very few exceptions, and those order patterns are more and more similar to the pre-pandemic levels, which is also why in our guide here for Q3, we've talked about seasonality again, something that we haven't seen and we'll consider the anomalous last eight quarters or so. So those ordering patterns are returning to what we saw in the pre pandemic level. And again, important to note here, large customers with on-market drugs continue to grow because that underlying large molecule demand remains at historical growth rates, and we talked about that high single digits maybe even low double digits, but certainly at the historical rates, which continues to provide that demand signal through the entire value chain. At the same time, development pipelines remain very solid across the board. But if we look at Phase III, that's particularly strong. In fact, we would say it is stronger than it had been prior to the pandemic, and that further underwrites our long-term growth expectations. Now we talked about some of the smaller biotech customers, and that's where you tend to see some of these advanced modalities. Let's just call them for the sake of argument right now nucleic acid-based therapies, and perhaps a couple of other type bispecifics ADCs. And what we see there is that they have been over proportionately impacted by some of the funding contraction that we saw in the venture capital market, but that's improved, which is encouraging. But again, those smaller players really do need to focus on their most promising projects to play that. And that's going to have an effect on how much capital they spend on equipment. So if a particular player is positioned and their portfolio is skewed more towards these advanced therapies and the smaller customers where cash remains fairly tight, then that's going to impact the order book. With our broader portfolio, particularly with our skew towards commercialized drugs and those in late phases, we see that strength, and that's another reason why we feel good about exiting 2024 at high single digits or better. Now coming back to your question here on new modalities. New modalities are exciting. They're a small part of our business, and they're a small part of the overall market. Keep in mind, our business is driven by protein therapies in their various forms. And of course, we also are a leading player for the advanced therapies. But if you calibrate, this is a much smaller part of both our business and the market, and it's going to have a fair amount of variability, both in success rates in terms of the approvals that these advanced therapies received, but also in terms of the uptake and the reimbursement dynamics associated with those. So I think we're just at the very beginning of that trend to these advanced modalities going on. Lastly, China. The slowdown that we're seeing is really fairly broad-based. As you look at our portfolio, Life Science Equipment, in particular, has a research and more academic focus, and that's where you see a lot of waiting for the stimulus funds to be dispersed. And that segment is ready. The applications are filed. They're in the funnel, so to speak, but we need to see the disbursement of that. And we're not counting on that happening in any material form here in 2024. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Rainer M. Blair: Hey Tycho, welcome back. Tycho Peterson : Thank you, thank you. Rainer, I want to go back to instruments for just a minute and kind of your background, obviously, in SCIEX back in the day. Just thinking about the replacement cycle, we get a lot of questions on that for mass spec. How do you think about that potentially kicking in over the next couple of years, because I think there's some debate that some of that got pulled forward during COVID and maybe it's going to be more muted this cycle when you do start to see the replacement cycle from that aspect [ph]? Rainer M. Blair: So I think we would support that hypothesis that the additional funding and the various market subsidies pulled forward demand and replaced a lot of equipment out there during the pandemic and immediately following that. And that's why we've talked about the need, and we're experiencing that normalization period right now. And that replacement cycle is going to remain intact. And that's why we would say we're probably sort of in the early innings, mid-innings here of that recovery, the first step that we're probably going to see here are the lower comps in the second half. And it's probably going to take 2025 to start approaching that normal replacement cycle again, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then on bioprocess, I appreciate all the color. We started to get more questions on yield improvements. I'm wondering how you think about that, just your customers getting more efficient and then how do you think about capacity kind of freeing up in the industry, whether it's Novo selling off some of the talent capacity or Wushi [ph] having to get rid of some capacity in the U.S. Just curious how you think about that playing into kind of the equipment side of things? And then maybe the last part, just what's your view on kind of doing more on the services side, CDMO type work and adding your own capacity? Rainer M. Blair: So starting with yields and improving customer yields, that's what we do. Our focus in bioprocessing is to help our customers improve the yields and there's plenty of opportunity for that to ultimately lower the total cost of manufacturing of these life-saving certainly quality of life improving drugs and to improve accessibility to these drugs around the world. So that's what we do. And we don't view that as an inhibitor to growth. On the contrary, through creating more value for our customers, we see more opportunity for growth there and differentiation and believe that we're very well positioned. Now as we think about capacity here in the marketplace, we actually believe that capacity certainly for commercial production and what is in Phase III needs to increase. We don't believe that in the large manufacturers, pharma or CDMO, that ultimately there is sufficient capacity for the long term, and we would expect that capacity to continue to increase, and there's moves in the marketplace that demonstrate that. And that underwrites also our perspective on equipment orders growth. Now as it relates to services, we've talked about that at length. We're very focused on the scope of the businesses that we have. We're excited about investing in those businesses and helping our customers do what they do. We do provide services in order to help them with some of their most complex and new therapies and then ultimately the tech transfers to either the pharma company itself or its CDMO partner. Tycho Peterson : Okay, very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks. John Bedford : Thank you everybody for joining. We'll be around all day and rest of the week for questions. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you.

Our team delivered strong third quarter results with revenue, adjusted net earnings per share and cash flow, all coming in ahead of our expectations. We were especially pleased with the continued positive momentum in bioprocessing and another exceptional quarter at Cepheid and we enhanced our long term competitive advantage with the release of several impactful new innovations across our businesses. Now we see a bright future ahead for Danaher. A transformation in our portfolio over the last several years has created a focused life sciences and diagnostics leader positioned for higher long term growth, expanded margins and stronger cash flow. Danaher is purpose-built to help customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. Our proven ability to innovate is enabling faster, more accurate diagnoses and helping customers reduce the time and cost needed to sustainably develop and deliver life-changing therapies. Now, the unique combination of our talented team, our differentiated science and technology portfolio and the power of the Danaher Business System positions us well as we seek to maximize value for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. So with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter 2024 results. Sales were $5.8 billion in the third quarter and we delivered 0.5% core revenue growth. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets increased low single-digits with low single-digit growth in North America and mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe. High-growth markets were down mid-single-digits including a high single-digit decline in China. Our gross profit margin for the second quarter was 58.7% and our adjusted operating profit margin of 27.5% was down 10 basis points as accelerated investments in innovation offset the favorable impact of cost saving initiatives. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.71 were essentially flat year-over-year and we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.8 billion year-to-date, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 135%. Now, let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our Biotechnology segment was flat year-over-year, with our bioprocessing business up low single-digits and our discovery and medical business down high single digits. In bioprocessing, we were encouraged with the continued positive momentum we saw in the quarter. Notably, orders increased high single-digits sequentially, which is the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential order improvement, and our book-to-bill ratio improved to approximately 1.0. Now geographically, we saw improving order trends in developed markets as large customers are returning to more normal ordering patterns. In China, orders and underlying activity levels remain weak, particularly for equipment, as customers continue to conserve their capital. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our larger pharma, biopharma and CDMO customers. Production volumes at these customers, who are primarily manufacturing monoclonal antibody therapies, has continued to grow in line with historical averages. Now we've seen demand at these customers steadily improve throughout the year as they're moving past inventory destocking and anticipate this gradual recovery will continue over the coming quarters. In contrast, we're not seeing the same level of improvement in underlying performance from our smaller customers. Despite a modest improvement in the funding environment, they continue to rationalize their therapeutic programs and remain cautious with their investments. Now, putting this all together, we continue to expect low single-digit core revenue decline in our bioprocessing business for the full year 2024 and this includes an assumption of high single-digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Now, as destocking moves behind us, we're increasingly excited about the long term opportunities ahead for Cytiva's leading bioprocessing franchise. Monoclonal antibodies, which comprise the majority of our revenues, remain the largest investment area for our customers. We're also seeing accelerated adoption of these therapies and six of the top 10 highest revenue-generating drugs today are monoclonal antibodies. With our comprehensive portfolio, our best-in-class scientific services and innovation focused on increasing yields and enhancing manufacturing efficiencies, we believe we're very well positioned to support our customers today and well into the future. Now turning to our Life Sciences segment, core revenue decreased by 2%, in line with our expectations. Core revenue in our life sciences instruments businesses collectively declined mid-single-digits with market conditions in the third quarter largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Ongoing research and lab activity is driving growth in consumables and service, which was more than offset by a decline in capital equipment, particularly in China. Announced stimulus measures in China have not yet translated into meaningful order activity, as customers are still awaiting details on the implementation of these programs. Now, in the meantime, many customers are delaying purchasing decisions. Outside of China, our end markets are relatively stable, and we were encouraged to see early signs of improvement in demand among our pharma and biopharma customers, particularly in North America. Now, during the quarter, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences introduced the Cydem VT. Cydem VT is a fully automated, high-throughput cell culture system designed to simplify and accelerate the complex and lengthy process of clone screening and cell line development. Now, by harnessing the power of the Cydem VT, researchers can optimize workflows and reduce hands-on time by up to 90%, enabling them to efficiently identify the most promising clones and improve the success rate of their cell line development projects. In July, we completed the acquisition of Genedata, a leading provider of enterprise and workflow software used in drug discovery and development. Genedata's advanced software solutions automate complex R&D processes, enabling biopharma researchers to analyze and interpret samples more quickly. So we're really excited to welcome this innovative team to our Life Sciences segment. Now, Beckman Cydem VT and the acquisition of Genedata are both great examples of how we're strengthening our long term competitive advantage while helping our customers accelerate the drug discovery process. In our genomics consumables business, core revenue declined low single-digits, continuing the trends we saw in the second quarter. In August, IDT expanded its synthetic biology portfolio with the launch of Rapid Genes. These ready-to-use NGS-verified clonal genes are cost effective and offer fast turnaround, allowing pharmaceutical researchers to quickly pursue high-throughput experiments such as antibody development. IDT's long history of innovation is one of the key reasons the research community turns to IDT to help advance drug discovery and accelerate the pace of genomic medicine development. Now moving to our Diagnostics segment, core revenue increased 5%. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered low single-digit core revenue growth. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single-digits, with strong global demand, partially offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China. Outside of China, recurring revenue was up high single-digits, driven by recent new product introductions and installed base expansion. The Beckman team continued their accelerated cadence of new product innovation this quarter with the release of the DxC 500i integrated chemistry and immunoassay analyzer. Now, the DxC 500i is specifically designed to improve efficiency and meet the unique workflow needs of low-volume laboratory customers such as community hospitals. So this highlights Beckman's commitment to serving the entire healthcare network by providing a comprehensive portfolio of solutions for low, mid and high-throughput core labs. In molecular diagnostics, Cepheid's core revenue increased double digits with broad-based strength across respiratory and non-respiratory assays. Cepheid's respiratory revenue of approximately $425 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $200 million as we saw both higher volumes and a favorable mix of our four-in-one test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV. Favorable volume was driven in part by customers purchasing in preparation for the upcoming respiratory season. Now, based on activity in the third quarter and our expectation of a respiratory season with normal severity, we expect respiratory revenue of approximately $1.7 billion for the full year of 2024. Outside of respiratory, increasing menu adoption and system utilization helped drive another quarter of mid-teens growth in Cepheid's core non-respiratory reagent portfolio, including more than 20% growth in Group A Strep, sexual health and virology assays. We also saw strong installed base growth, particularly for our lower throughput systems, as customers continue to add GeneXpert instruments in their clinics and alternate care sites. So this expansion out of the hospital allows our customers to improve financial and clinical outcomes by standardizing care across their networks. I'd like to thank all of you who joined us last month for our Investor Day, where we had the opportunity to showcase our differentiated diagnostics portfolio. During the event, we highlighted how DBS-driven innovation and commercial execution have meaningfully improved the growth and margin profile of our diagnostics franchise over the last several years. We also talked about how we are uniquely positioned for long term growth opportunities in high-value, high-need areas such as neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases and oncology. And if you haven't had the chance to see the replay, I'd encourage you to watch it on our Investor Relations website. Now, let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024. For the full year 2024, there is no change to our previous guidance and as a reminder, we anticipate a core revenue decline in low single-digit percent range and a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%. In the fourth quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the low single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with our better-than-expected third quarter performance and expect the trends we're seeing today to continue into Q4. Our team's commitment to executing and innovating with the Danaher Business System enabled us to deliver strong results while continuing to accelerate growth initiatives across the portfolio. Our third quarter results also reflect the unique positioning of Danaher today. We have an outstanding group of businesses that serve attractive end markets with favorable long term, secular growth drivers. We're further enhancing our portfolio and competitive advantage with innovation that is helping customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. So, looking ahead, we believe this powerful combination of our leading portfolio, proven ability to innovate, and our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System provides a solid foundation for delivering differentiated long term financial performance. And so with that, I'll turn the call back over to John. John Bedford : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. I want to probe into the instrument numbers a little bit, wondering if you can give us instrument growth ex-China and then just maybe talk a little bit about where it's worse and where it's getting better, whether it's flow, mass spec, lab automation, microscopy, and any leading indicators of funnel dynamics that make you feel better coming out of the quarter on the instrument side? Matt McGrew : Yeah. Tycho, it's Matt, I'll give you the kind of the number on what it is. It's probably low to mid-single-digit ex-China. And then, Rainer, you want to kind of give color on what we're seeing on the instrument side? Rainer Blair : Sure. No, absolutely. So -- and then, of course, in China, we would say that it's down high single-digits. But if you look at the developed markets, let's start with those. The end markets were relatively stable sequentially, but we haven't seen an inflection there yet, although in pharma and in biotech, while it remains soft, we're starting to see some early signs of improvement, especially in North America. On the academic research side, there we see it stable in North America, with Europe modestly weaker. But coming back to China, we're all aware, of course, of the announced stimulus, but that really hasn't translated into meaningful orders for us as customers continue to wait for those details. So -- and while they're waiting for those details, they tend to also delay perhaps the normal purchasing habits that they might have had. So the stimulus funding has yet to pick up here in the third quarter. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then a follow-up. I know you don't want to talk about '25 yet, but if we look at kind of the run rate for guidance on life sciences that you're giving us for the fourth quarter, the Street is at 6% next year on life sciences. Is that realistic, kind of, given the run rate you're laying out for the fourth quarter? And then anything you can say on China bioprocess for next year? We've seen some of your peers talk down numbers as well? Rainer Blair : Tycho, we're still looking here to see how the fourth quarter plays out and to see whether we can see a pickup in the stimulus, particularly in China, while we do expect the developed markets to be stable along the lines that I just discussed for Q3. So we're looking to see how China's stimulus plays out here in Q4 before we can get to 2025 numbers. Now as it relates to bioprocessing, we continue to see there a low activity level, albeit stable, but at a lower level, and we expect that to take more time to play out here in the near term. Matt McGrew : Yeah, maybe just to kind of follow up, I think the comment on the China stimulus is for tools, Tycho, right, just kind of what we're seeing there for '25 overall. So that's kind of '25 overall for Danaher for tools, but for bioprocessing for '25, I think we've kind of talked about a gradual recovery here in '24 and that's pretty well played out like we thought. Like Rainer said, we do need to see sort of how Q4 plays out, but -- before we kind of give anything formal on '25. But that said, the Q4 exit rate of high single-digits, an important kind of building block for us as we build backlog and visibility heading into 2025. But given what we've seen here through Q3, I think we're going to see a gradual recovery continue into '25. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then on the life science, the guidance, fourth quarter down low single-digit, but the Street next year is up 6%. I was trying to also reconcile whether that step-up is reasonable. Rainer Blair : Yeah, I mean, I think the biggest factor there for -- as we look to next year will be what happens with the China stimulus for life sciences. Tycho Peterson : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hey, thanks. I actually want to just follow up on exactly your last point there on bioprocess sort of exit rate and how to think about 2025 and just how you're feeling about that market developing, the gradual recovery. You talked about, I think, five consecutive quarters of order growth there. In the last couple of quarters, you've had high single-digit order growth. Revenues for bioprocess have done well this year as well, but they've lagged the growth level. So it seems like there's a little bit of a lag in terms of the orders translating to revenue, which you would expect, obviously. Do you think that lag is closing? Do you think that we're getting closer as we hit 4Q? You talked about high single-digit bioprocess where you're going to start to see some of that order growth we've seen over the last quarters -- couple of quarters start to translate and again translates into next year? Matt McGrew : Yeah, I mean, I think, it's a perfect frame. I mean you think about exiting the year at high single-digits, but you kind of take a step back and you look at, from a core growth perspective, in 2024, we're going to be down low single-digits. And so as you sort of think about where we kind of exit the totality of '24 with that gradual sort of kind of recovery in mind as we head to '25, I think that's kind of the way that we're thinking about it from a perspective of what revenue will do next year based on the fact that the order trajectory has gotten better over the last five quarters. But like I said, I mean, it would be great for us to see Q4 here before we go. But I do think going down low single-digits this year in revenue, be positive next year we believe. But let's see where the trajectory goes here, given the fact that I do believe this is going to kind of be a continuation of what we saw in '24, which is a pretty gradual recovery. Very encouraging, though. So we're very happy with where we are. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. And then, a follow-up, I want to ask on Cepheid, a couple quick questions, if I can. One is, you talked about timing of some purchasing of the kits in the quarter. Any chance you could quantify that? I know you did $425 million in respiratory versus the $200 million guide. Do you think that $225 million was timing or maybe was some of that organic beat and some of it was timing? Just trying to get a sense of how much pull forward there was from the fourth quarter. And in the press release, you also specifically called out Cepheid gaining market share in molecular testing. If you could expand on that, where are you gaining share in terms of customer or geographically? Any specifics there? Thanks. Matt McGrew : Yeah, I mean, Mike, it's a little hard to parse out to the dollar, how much of the beat was related to pull-forwards versus just sort of better than we thought. I think probably, anecdotally from what we heard from customers, I would say that we do believe that there was -- a good portion of that was probably due to wanting to make sure that they had kind of the security of supply heading into the fourth quarter, which is not a huge surprise, I guess. But as we sort of look forward to the fourth quarter then, we did take that into account as we thought about what we might see here in the fourth quarter. So, I'd say a significant portion of the beat was probably related to that. As far as market shares go, I think I'd probably put it in two categories. I'd probably say, one, it's largely in the US, though that's not an absolute statement. I would say largely in the US. As you know, we are entirely in sort of hospitals as well as at near point of care. We've been doing very, very well with IDNs as we've expanded beyond their core hospitals into other point of care settings closer to the patient. That has continued here in the quarter, and I expect that, that would continue as well again with the installed base that we've been able to drive. Michael Ryskin : Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : We'll move next to Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. [Technical Difficulty] Doug Schenkel : Hey, good morning, guys. I guess a couple of quick follow-ups. There's been a lot of questions that kind of dance around the 2025 question, which I'm sure you appreciate. When I look at numbers, the Street's looking for 8% core growth with bioprocessing growing double digits and life sciences growing 7%. You haven't said anything about anything resembling a snapback. Respiratory comps are going to be tough. VBP seems to be picking up in China. Stimulus activity follow-through seems unclear. And then just knowing you guys, you tend to be conservative. So cutting to the chase, am I missing anything? And should the street be modeling things at these levels recognizing you still want to see another quarter? But as we sit here today, the numbers look a smidge high to me. Am I missing anything? Rainer Blair : Well, I don't think you're missing much here. If we just take a look real quick on how we're thinking about 2025, it's important to know that we need to see how Q4 plays out here. I'll come back to that in a minute, Doug. But there's still a couple important variables in Q4 that's going to shape the next year. And those relate to really the trajectory of the order book in bioprocessing. It's so important. So certainly the high single-digit core growth that we expect in bioprocessing for the fourth quarter is fully supported by backlog and what we expect in orders. But we also want to see more deeply into 2025 by seeing that orders momentum here continue into Q4. So that's going to be key here for understanding how the second half of 2025 plays out in bioprocessing. As it relates to respiratory for Cepheid and other key variable here, as we just talked about, there's been some purchasing ahead here in Q3 and based on what we saw in the southern hemisphere, we do expect the northern hemisphere to have a more normal respiratory season. And as you know, that straddles the first respiratory season of the year, straddles Q4 and Q1. And then lastly, and this is important for life sciences, but also more generally, we need to see how this China stimulus plays out in 2025, and we'd like to see some indicators of that accelerating here in Q4. To date, we've not really seen anything meaningful in that regard. So we're going to put numbers all around us here and then update you in January. Doug Schenkel : Okay, super helpful, Rainer. And I guess another follow-up on just -- I mean, essentially trying to get at the question of the utility of the book-to-bill metric. Like, if we look at book-to-bill from Q3 of last year and this year and assume that bioprocessing accounts for roughly 85% of biotech sales, it seems like orders were up over 20% year-over-year. So I'm not sure if that math is right. That would be one question. But if it is, I'm just wondering how important is that as we think about the outlook for a return to robust bioprocessing growth, because I think there are some that are concluding that it's taking longer to convert. I think there's others that are assuming it's converting much more quickly than it used to. I guess we're just trying to get at how useful this metric is, especially keeping in mind, this is largely a consumable business at this point. Matt McGrew : Yeah. I mean, I think we've talked in the past about book-to-bill being -- it's an interesting number and can be helpful in certain businesses. But traditionally or historically, we have not really used book-to-bill to kind of run this business for the exact reasons you said, lots of consumables and the timing of when the shipments hit. So I think from our perspective, book-to-bill is not something we spend a lot of time thinking about. But we do think about the orders. And as you said, the orders here in the quarter were north of 20%. Now, that is off of a very easy comp. So I think we need to have a little bit of restraint on what that means. But five quarters of sequential order growth is important. I think it's also -- what gave me a lot of encouragement in this quarter was, typically, we do see some seasonality where we go down from Q2 to Q3, we did not see that in this environment. I was encouraged by that, that we actually went up again sequentially. And so I sort of look at everything and think about my order growth rate, the percentages, even though they're off low numbers. That's important. The fact that we've had five sequential quarters in a row coming off of where we've been on the destocking, I think that's an important factor. So, yeah, to your point, I'm not sure book-to-bill is super critical for us, but maybe triangulating that with those other two factors, I really do think we're really happy with the trajectory of what we've seen in 2024 and what that means heading into 2025. But again, I think we've seen a pretty gradual build-up here in revenue and in orders, and I suspect that, that continues. Doug Schenkel : Super helpful. All right, thanks, guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi, Rainer. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess, one -- I want to ask on genomics here, low singles, maybe in the past you spoke about the sequencing versus gene editing, writing. What were trends between those two segments? And I think this Rapid Genes that you mentioned, maybe talk about what Rapid Genes is. And would you expect some share gains here due to launch of this product? Rainer Blair : Sure, Vijay. We -- on the gene reading side of the house, we do still see the markets softer, as -- particularly in the smaller customer, emerging biotech segment, we see less activity. While the funding improved, those customers are still prioritizing their project quite a bit. And so we're seeing a bit less consumption in that area. Now in gene editing, of course, that's a different story, where we see a great deal of CRISPR and Guide RNA and other types of solutions doing very well. Having said that, and coming back to our new product launch here with Rapid Genes, we're very excited about that. This will offer whole genes to our customers at a quality and a turnaround time, which is highly differentiated in the market. We expect that, over time here, to provide us some tailwind. So we're very pleased here with how IDT is performing in this environment. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And maybe, Matt, one for you. Your Q4 operating margin assumption, it came down a tad versus the prior. I think we're looking at low-30s exit rates. Is there some timing of expenses or anything changed on margin assumption? And if it is, any change in investments and implications here as we look at incremental margins for fiscal '25? Matt McGrew : Yeah, I mean, our full year margin didn't change, approximately 29%. Q4 will be at approximately 30%. I mean, I think it's probably a function of a couple of things. One, we're going to have -- we anticipate at least lower revenue in respiratory in Q4. Obviously, that has some margin implications to it. I think we did have a little bit of sort of timing, a little bit better bioprocessing in Q3 than we thought. And probably some of that might be a little bit of timing-related as well, sort of impacting Q4 margins. And as you said, we've had a pretty good year here. And as we head into the fourth quarter, we're thinking about the cost structure, thinking about the investments that we want to make in the business, and we're taking an opportunity to make sure that we do some of those smartly here in the quarter. And I think you sort of add it all up and you kind of come up with that adjusted operating margin in the 30s, sort of holding the full year here as we head into the end of the year. Vijay Kumar : I'm sorry. The incremental margin implications for fiscal '25, should the fall-through be in the 35% to 40% range? Matt McGrew : Well, I mean, it's going to depend on volume, I think, Vijay. But like we've kind of talked about from a margin perspective that this is -- this business when it is operating sort of in a normal environment, the low-30s are where it should be. So, I mean, '25, we'll sort of update you that in January when we get there. But that'll be a function of volume and mix, depending on where it comes from, it'll be different. So we'll have to until we get a little bit further to give you that, but that's sort of how I'm thinking about '25. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thank you, guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, fellas. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : You guys mentioned again this quarter that the smaller customers in bioprocessing not coming back as fast. At what point does it become such a small piece of the business that maybe we stop having that color or it's less material? Or maybe a different way to ask the question is, what percent of revenues is it now where it's kind of large versus small customers? Matt McGrew : Yeah, I mean, the larger versus small, roughly, Scott, is kind of 75% are larger and 25% are smaller. And I think we give the color primarily because those smaller customers have a little bit of a different dynamic than the larger customers. Larger customers typically have on-market or later-phase, Phase 3 trial kind of exposures, whereas the smaller customers tend to be earlier-stage, probably a little bit more related to, in some instances, the cell and gene therapies of the world. So a little bit different. They act differently in the funding environment as well. So I think it's -- we're just trying to kind of give color as to what we're seeing there, where we are seeing an improvement in the funding environment. It's not necessarily working its way through into orders and revenue at this point. And so just to kind of give a little bit of color. But, to your point, I think is, most of our customers are the larger customers with stuff that is on-market. When I look back at what has caused all the pain of the last kind of two years in this business, it was destocking at those customers, and I believe that is largely behind us. And so that's why I think it's really encouraging. As we stand here and look forward, though, the recovery has been gradual, it has happened, it has happened at the largest customers, gives me a lot of faith that the long term outlook of this business still is the high single-digits. When we get there, kind of a bit of a TBD, but I think that's the reason we sort of want to give a little bit of color on both of them. Scott Davis : Okay, that makes sense, Matt. And, guys, we didn't talk about the buyback or M&A or kind of your funnel or nothing mentioned in prepared remarks. Any update there as it relates to your confidence or size or any metrics around the funnel be helpful. Matt McGrew : Yeah, I'll just touch real quick on the buyback, and maybe Rainer can give some color on the funnel, the M&A funnel. But I mean, the buyback, I think if you see, we did complete it technically, that buyback was straddled, both Q2 and Q3. So if you see something in the queue, that's what it was related to, just so everybody's kind of clear, it was not a new issue. And so it was the final pieces, if you will, of the buyback that we talked about in Q2. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Matt. And as it relates to the M&A environment, Scott, as we do every day, we're out there cultivating across all of our segments, and we're fairly active there. Our funnels are pretty dynamic. It's fair to say that while the environment, though, is improving, valuations are still elevated. And so we feel great about our positioning both in terms of the assets that are attractive out there and, of course, our balance sheet. But we're going to maintain our discipline with our deals needing to meet our trifecta of attractive end market, attractive company and then, of course, the valuation framework, the model has to work as well. So active, but we still see that the valuations are elevated. Scott Davis : Makes sense, Rainer. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it. Good luck, guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Yeah, hi, Rainer, Matt, thanks for taking my question. So, specifically on China, just following up on a few things, what's the right sort of jump-off point for China for -- as we think about 2025, just given the uncertainties here in the market and the backdrop of the stimulus? And also wondering if you can elaborate a bit on the China value-based pricing, how much of an impact are you baking there? And just lastly on China, how much is local bioprocess competition important in this market? And does that change your view for the long term growth of the worldwide bioprocess or biotech segment long term growth, just now that local competition has emerged and is being utilized more in some of those local maps? Matt McGrew : Yeah, maybe I'll start, because I think your first question and your third question sort of wrapped around China for next year, and bioprocessing, maybe I'll let Rainer take that. But just VBP, just to remind everybody, we sort of assumed that it was going to be kind of $150 million of impact over three years really starting this year as we ramp up. Our assumptions initially were sort of that, that would be linear over the next three years. We are starting to see a little bit more activity in China around VBP here at the end of this year. So I think we'll have a better sense of what that linearity looks like after we get through next couple of months, where it does look like the activity is sort of ramping up. So I still think the number is a good number. But how that rolls out and plays out will sort of be determined in the next couple of weeks. Rainer Blair : As it relates to the JOP, Puneet, really, I think we need to view China as stable and sort of bumping along the bottom. And we don't expect a change in that in the short term as we go through and think about 2025 unless we see a material change in the execution and rollout of the stimulus program in China. So we expect China to continue to develop as it has been here for most of the year in 2024. Now, as it relates to your question on local competition, certainly there's local competition out there, but we have to be clear that, particularly in biotech, there are many companies simply struggling to survive, and they're buying essentially the least expensive solution that they can to make it to the end of the month, and it's just going to have to be good enough. So that's sort of one section of the market. Then there's another segment that really is targeting the international sale of their therapeutic molecules. And they tend to want to have solutions from multinational companies, first and foremost from ourselves here and Cytiva in order to ensure that regulators around the world are comfortable with the inputs that are required to make these incredibly effective drugs. So, yes, there's local competition. We would see it more on the margin, especially as it relates to local molecules. Puneet Souda : Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. I'll leave it there. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Puneet. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. I wanted to circle back to the trends in life science, instruments and equipment specifically, because I think you do have some consumables in that instrument reporting. Can you elaborate a bit further on what the equipment trends were in the quarter from a growth perspective? Rainer Blair : So just to talk about the quarter more generally, the market conditions in third quarter were essentially consistent with what we saw in the first half of '24, and capital equipment spending continued to be constrained, and to the last question, particularly in China. Now, in contrast to the equipment-constrained environment, consumables and service grew in the quarter as lab and research facilities and institutions activity has started to stabilize. So we do see equipment being constrained, but consumables are starting to move. Dan Leonard : And then a quick follow-up. Rainer, could you comment on the performance at Abcam? It seems like versus our numbers, the run rate there is improving. I'm unsure if that's the correct read or if it's just rounding, or if there's other M&A into that revenue mix? Rainer Blair : There's no other M&A in that revenue mix. But of course, we're working very hard to drive our hypothesis around Abcam. And right now, the focus is on transitioning into Danaher, of course, and the team is making great progress with that. They're implementing, actually pulling on our DBS capabilities to drive those growth accelerators and, of course, improve the cost positioning that we've talked about. So we feel very good about where we are with Abcam and, long-term, we absolutely believe that this meets our expectations, both in terms of growth and the bottom line. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our final question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Rainer Blair : Hey, Jack. Jack Meehan : I wanted to ask about diagnostics in the China region. To start, for Matt, can you just check my math is, can you remind me, is this like 15% diagnostic sales? And I was trying to back into how Beckman might have done in the quarter in the region, it could have been to the tune of down 20% or so. And then for Rainer, would just be great to hear about your thoughts on regional dynamics in diagnostics. Is this all kind of price impact or any change in kind of share shift? Thank you. Matt McGrew : Yeah. So diagnostics, the total revenue for China diagnostics, I think you're in the ballpark on that. As far as what China was -- from China diagnostics perspective in the quarter, I don't think it would have been down that high, Jack. Probably it was down in overall diagnostics, which -- most of that's going to be Beckman. It was kind of down low double-digits. So I think that's probably a more -- a better place to anchor. But I think your total number is probably pretty close to right as far as percentage sales. Rainer Blair : We saw across the world here, really with one exception, strong performance in all of our clinical diagnostic businesses. And of course, you heard from Matt around Cepheid that we believe to be taking share there really at all levels. But coming back to our clinical diagnostic businesses, we saw a high single-digit recurring revenue growth in North America and Europe. On the other hand, we come back to China, and China, we see the impact of the volume-based procurement, which is what brings us down. We also had, in Beckman Coulter in particular, a high hardware sellout comp last year as we were burning down some backlog. But we're very pleased with how our clinical diagnostics businesses continue to develop, continue to take share, and volume-based procurement is sort of the topic right now for diagnostics in China. Operator : Thank you. And this will conclude our Q&A session. I'll turn the call over to John for closing remarks. John Bedford : Thank you, everybody, for joining today. We'll be around for follow-ups all day, rest of the week. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Rainer Blair : Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone, and we appreciate you joining us on the call today. So we finished the year strong with better-than-anticipated core revenue in all three of our segments and we were particularly encouraged by another quarter of positive momentum in our bioprocessing business and the improving performance in our Life Sciences instruments businesses. Our team's disciplined execution also drove solid cash flow and operating profit margin expansion. Now throughout 2024, our 63,000 associates demonstrated an unwavering commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System, which enabled us to successfully navigate a dynamic operating environment. Now their dedication not only drove meaningful process improvements across our businesses, it also delivered impactful innovations for our customers, both of which are positioning Danaher for sustainable long-term success. Now, looking to 2025 and beyond, we believe Danaher is better positioned than at any point in our 40-year history. The transformation in our portfolio since the beginning of the pandemic has shaped us into a focused life sciences and Diagnostics innovator with a re-rated long-term growth, margin, and cash flow profile. Our differentiated science and technology portfolio paired with the power of DBS and our talented team positions us well to create long-term shareholder value, while making a meaningful positive impact on human health. So with that, let's take a closer look at our full-year 2024 financial results. Sales were $23.9 billion and core revenue declined 1.5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 28.6% was essentially flat year-over-year and adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $7.48. We also generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 135%. Strong free cash flow generation is one of the most important metrics at Danaher and 2024 marks the 33rd consecutive year of free cash flow to net income conversion which exceeded 100% and speaks to the differentiated quality of our earnings and business models. Now through 2024 and into the start of 2025, we deployed approximately $7 billion of capital towards the repurchase of 28 million shares of Danaher common stock. This includes approximately 20 million shares purchased in the second and third quarters and approximately 8 million shares purchased in the fourth quarter and into January 2025. We also remained active on the M&A front, completing several strategic acquisitions during the year. Now these acquisitions bring innovative technologies and solutions that further strengthen our competitive advantages and position us for sustained long-term success. Now we also continued to make substantial investments in innovation throughout the year, enabling the launch of several groundbreaking technologies that are advancing our customers' critical work. In Biotechnology, Cytiva introduced the Sefia cell therapy manufacturing platform, which is helping address critical cost and capacity constraints associated with CAR-T cell therapy manufacturing. The efficiencies customers gained through the Sefia platform have the potential to increase patient access to these life-saving therapies. In Life Sciences, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences introduced the Cydem VT Automated Cell Culture System, which simplifies and accelerates the cell line development process, enabling pharmaceutical researchers to bring therapies to market faster. And in Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics made significant strides in expanding the cardiac and blood virus menus on the DxI 9000, our next-generation high-resolution immunoassay analyzer. With sensitivity 100 times greater than traditional immunoassay systems, the DxI 9000 is enabling faster and more accurate patient diagnoses and ultimately paving the way for precision diagnostics. These are just a few examples of how our innovation engine is driving long-term growth and helping customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. So now let's turn to our fourth quarter 2024 results in more detail. Sales were $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter and we delivered 1% core revenue growth. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were essentially flat with a low-single-digit decline in North America and a low-single-digit increase in Western Europe. High-growth markets were up low single digits with solid performance outside of China, more than offsetting a mid-single-digit decline in China. Our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 59.5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 29.6% was up 90 basis points, driven primarily by the positive impact of cost savings initiatives. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.14 were up 2.4% year-over-year and we generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. So now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our Biotechnology segment increased high-single-digits year-over-year, with our bioprocessing business up high-single-digits and our discovery and medical business is up low-double-digits. In bioprocessing, the gradual recovery we saw through the year continued into the fourth quarter. We were particularly encouraged by the sustained positive momentum in our order book, which grew high-single-digits sequentially and this represents the sixth consecutive quarter of high-single-digit sequential order growth. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by consumables, supported by robust demand for commercialized therapies. Equipment demand, while improved remained subdued as customers continue to be cautious with their capital spending. Now in China, underlying activity levels were relatively stable, but weak as customers faced ongoing challenges in a difficult funding environment. But the continued progress we're making in our business, coupled with healthy underlying market trends reinforces our confidence in the long-term outlook for Cytiva's bioprocessing franchise. Monoclonal antibodies, which comprise more than 75% of our bioprocessing revenues remain the largest investment area for our customers and 2024 was a near-record year of FDA approvals for new monoclonal antibodies. At the same time, biosimilar development and production are increasing as patents on high-volume therapies expire, making life-saving treatments more accessible and driving broader adoption. With our comprehensive portfolio and an innovation engine focused on increasing yields and enhancing manufacturing efficiencies, we believe we're very well-positioned to support our customers today and for the long term. Now turning to our Life Sciences segment, core revenue increased by 1%. Core revenue in our Life Sciences instrument business was up slightly, exceeding our expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, we saw modest demand improvements at our pharma and applied customers. In China, while we did see a modest benefit from the ongoing stimulus program, market conditions continue to be challenging as customers remain cautious with their investments. In October, Leica Microsystems expanded its STELLARIS Confocal Microscope Platform with the introduction of SpectraPlex, a cutting-edge solution for 3D imaging in spatial biology. SpectraPlex, enables researchers to gain deeper insights into cellular organization, interactions and spatial phenotyping, advancing the understanding of disease progression and aiding in the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Now core revenue in our genomics consumables business declined in the quarter. Growth across next-generation sequencing products and basic research was more than offset by declines in proteins, plasmids, and gene writing and editing solutions. Moving to our Diagnostics segment, core revenue decreased 2%. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered low-single-digit core revenue growth, like Biosystems led the way with nearly 10% growth driven by strength across core histology, advanced staining, and digital pathology. Notably, Leica placed a record number of its GT450 digital pathology slide scanners this quarter, as clinicians are increasingly looking to leverage its predictive algorithms and productivity gains to deliver more accurate and timely patient diagnoses. To further enhance the digital pathology capabilities, Leica recently established a strategic partnership with Indica Labs, a global leader in AI-powered digital pathology software. This partnership aims to accelerate the development of next-generation cancer diagnostics by combining Leica Biosystems expertise in instrumentation and extensive global footprint with Indica Labs' leadership in enterprise, software, and artificial intelligence. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was essentially flat with mid-single-digit core revenue growth outside of China, offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China. Earlier this month, Beckman introduced several cutting-edge research use-only assays for neurodegenerative disease research on the DxI 9000. Now these assays allow researchers to detect and quantify emerging neurodegenerative biomarkers with exceptional sensitivity and specificity, providing valuable insights into conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted breakthrough device designation to Beckman's p-tau217, beta-Amyloid 1-42 assay designed to aid clinicians in identifying patients with Alzheimer's. This designation reflects the potential of Beckman's test to transform how clinicians diagnose and manage Alzheimer's, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for patients and families affected by this devastating disease. In molecular diagnostics, increasing menu adoption and system utilization contributed to another quarter of mid-teens core revenue growth in Cepheid's core non-respiratory reagent portfolio. All of these product lines delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, led by over 20% growth in sexual health as customers are increasingly adopting our Multiplex Vaginitis Panel or MVP. The rapid growth of the MVP panel since its introduction highlights the value, rapid turnaround diagnostics brings to women's health clinicians at the point of care. Cepheid's Multiplex Panel enables physicians to quickly and accurately diagnose infections and prescribe targeted treatments, reducing the need for multiple office visits. Now beyond enabling improved clinical outcomes, MVP underscores the significant growth opportunities ahead as we continue to expand our women's health business and is also a great example of how Cepheid is unlocking long-term growth opportunities in outpatient settings. Cepheid's respiratory revenue of approximately $550 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $350 million as we saw both higher volumes and a favorable mix of our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV. In 2024, Cepheid's installed base grew by high-single-digits and is now more than 60,000 instruments globally. In recent quarters, we've seen healthcare systems and integrated delivery network customers accelerating the placement of new instruments at alternate care sites such as clinics and urgent care centers. This expansion beyond the hospital helps customers improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs by standardizing care across their networks. With the continued expansion of our leading global installed base, the largest test menu on the market and a robust innovation pipeline, Cepheid is well-positioned for sustained long-term growth. Now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the first quarter and the full year 2025. For the full year 2025, we anticipate core revenue growth of approximately 3%. In addition, we expect an approximately 2% revenue headwind due to recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We also expect a full-year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 28.5%. In the first quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the low-single-digit percentage range. Additionally, we expect the first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26.5%. So to wrap up, we are pleased with our fourth-quarter performance and look forward to building on this momentum as we move into 2025. Our team successfully executed through a dynamic environment to deliver strong financial results, while continuing to invest for the future. Looking ahead, the transformation in our portfolio paired with our organic growth investments has created a lineup of outstanding franchises that are very well-positioned in highly attractive end markets. And we're a better, stronger company today positioned for higher long-term growth, expanded margins and stronger cash flow with tremendous opportunities to continue building upon this foundation. With the powerful combination of our leading portfolio, talented team and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, we feel well-positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to John. John Bedford : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Matt McGrew : Good morning. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : Good morning. Wanted to start by digging more into the guide for Life Sciences in 2025, that's where I'm getting most of the questions, notably the pacing. So starting down mid-singles, getting to low-single digits up for the year. As you look at the operating businesses there, can you just call out, is there anything that stands out as one-off, or notable in terms of the ramp? I mean, just when in the year will you return to growth? Is 2Q reasonable or is it more back-half weighted? Rainer Blair : So, Jack, good morning, and thanks for the question. For 2025 in Life Sciences, it's the one segment where we see a little bit of noise right now with the external environment. But given that, we're trying to take a reasonably prudent approach to the guide for 2025 and we're assuming Life Science tools up for - up low-single digits and Pall and Genomics will be down. So we'll possibly do better, but where we sit today, this is probably a good starting point. As we think about the phasing, we would expect each quarter to get a little better. Matt McGrew : Okay. Jack, maybe - just Q1, like you said, it's kind of down mid-single digits. I think we probably are kind of flattish as we head into Q2, and then kind of ramp up from there. And really Q1, the big kind of comp issue is a lot of it really is Pall, in particular, some of the things in the industrial business, both year-over-year with some big projects that we saw there and then also sequentially kind of the step-down. If you will, from Q4 in Life Sciences, they were a double-digit grower here in Q4. I think they're going to be negative here in Q1. And given the size of that business, it's almost $2 billion. It does kind of move the needle. But the core tools we think is still in pretty good shape and kind of at the high end of low-single digits. Jack Meehan : Great. Okay. And then, Rainer, you alluded to this a little bit. Obviously, had the change in administration, and U.S. academic government funding has been a hot topic, a lot of headlines. I was curious if you could give us a state-of-the-state, what you're seeing in the market today and how, did that influence the way that you set the guide? Rainer Blair : So, well, it's only been a couple weeks here of the new administration, Jack, but in general, we'd expect the environment to be more business-friendly. And certainly, the election has not changed our view of our portfolio, which we know is positioned towards the most attractive secular growth trends in Life Sciences and Diagnostics. And sure, and we plan for this. And as you said, we've talked about that here in the Life Science guide for 2025. There's likely going to be some puts and takes, but we - we're confident we can leverage our portfolio and the Danaher Business System to continue to outperform. Matt McGrew : But Jack, I do think it's fair to call out that this is the one segment in Life Sciences where the noise around - like Rainer said, the noise around it is higher, because I think that's where we've seen most of the noise has been around that segment. So I think we're trying to take some of that noise into account. I think mostly it's going to be in Life Sciences, is where you see that. And I think it probably - it's probably fair to say that we took a fairly prudent approach, to how we thought about starting the year here, given some of the - kind of given some of the recent news. Jack Meehan : That all makes sense. Thank you, guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Jack. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on what you called out for the Diagnostics segment. I think there's a little bit of a shortfall there versus expectations in the guide. You called out specifically Cepheid respiratory, you're looking for $1.7 billion versus I think $1.95 billion in fiscal year '24. And then for volume-based procurement in China, you talked about $150 million for the year, versus previously you were expecting sort of a steady cadence of $50 per year. So just talk - can you just talk through those both pretty quickly? One is, what changed in the VBP? Sound like it changed a little bit in the fourth quarter, as well and just how you think VBP headwinds come through in 2025 and '26? And then for Cepheid respiratory, why is $1.7 billion the right number? I mean, we've talked about this for a while. It's sort of like, at what point do you say, okay, this is the new endemic. So you did $1.95 billion in 2024. Why isn't that just the new normal going forward where we're four years post-COVID, it feels like respiratory sort of like settled down a little bit. So what are you seeing in January that's making you revise that? Matt McGrew : Yes. Mike, let me see if I can capture all that. So first, VBP 150 versus the 50 that we thought before, that is correct. I think we think now and we saw 50 here in '20 in Q4. So probably 200 all-up, but 200 in two years instead of the three that we thought. So I think that's right. As far as why did, that and how did it accelerated in Q4, I mean, we just saw in Q4 a lot more aggressive stance in China. Particularly from the central government, to sort of really get after VBP and do some other things outside of just straight VBP, also going and doing some reimbursement cuts. And so, I think the combination of the tenders that we saw come through, the reimbursement cuts really accelerated here late in the quarter, frankly. This was kind of a November, almost in December phenomenon. So that kind of came through and informed our guide, as we think about going forward. From a respiratory perspective, you're right, we are here $1.7 billion. We've always thought that was about the normal range for a normal respiratory season in an endemic state. In the last two years, we did about $2 billion. And I think what we saw in the last couple years was we sort of had a bit of a double-dip, if you will. We had a big spike in September, October as people sort of return to school, and then return to work, return to school. And then we saw another one here, usually a typical respiratory season in January and February. And we didn't really see that this year. And so that was we're kind of assuming that we're going to go back to that normal respiratory pattern, where we see a bit of a spike up in the ILI, like we are seeing now. Did not see it as much here in Q3 like we normally do. And so, I feel pretty comfortable that $1.7 billion is the endemic rate. We did a little bit better the last couple of years. But that's no real different than, what it was like prior to COVID. We had respiratory season. Some are better than others, not better, but from a testing perspective, more testing versus not. So I feel pretty comfortable with the $1.7 billion still versus $2 billion being some sort of new number. I just - maybe we're proven wrong, but given what we've seen in the data, I think $1.7 billion is - it's probably going to be a pretty regular - pretty normal respiratory season. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up on bioprocess and biotechnology, you talked about 6% to 7% for the year in biotechnology, same thing for the first quarter. So it seems like sort of pretty steady throughout the year. I think we talked about bioprocess being maybe more of a high single-digit business, so thinking more of like an 8%, maybe 7% to 8%. Is the delta there really just the instrumentation part of it? Sort of if it wasn't for that, would you be at that 8% rate for the year? And if so, if it is instrumentation, just any signs of that, any hope of that coming back as you go through the year, just sort of like what's holding that back? Why is that still so subdued if the consumables are really back and the demand continues to be there? Rainer Blair : I'll tell you, we were very encouraged by what we're seeing in the bioprocessing business and the orders growth, six consecutive orders now of high single-digit orders growth. We don't normally talk about the year-over-year numbers, but even in the fourth quarter, well over 30% orders growth there, and probably one of the biggest quarters that we've had in two years in terms of orders growth. So we think the bioprocessing sets up very nicely. Now to your point, look, we expect 6% to 7% core growth in 2025. That's essentially similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. And what we're seeing in consumables, are essentially also back to normal here with large customers driving that. And we do see some improvement there with smaller customers as well, but they're still not back to normal, so to your question. And then as it relates to equipment, it's also better, but not quite back to normal. So we continue to be really encouraged, by what we're seeing and the recovery is clearly underway. Michael Ryskin : All right. Thank you. Operator : Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Rainer Blair : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : So I'm going to go into a completely different direction, because guidance we can kind of fixate on for the rest of the call. I'm sure lots of people will. It was maybe a little disappointing. But I wanted to get a sense from you guys just in talking about seeing some of the build-out of test capability in Cepheid. What does AI do for you guys at - it could be broader than just Cepheid, but when you think about ability to kind of lever that computing power into something that maybe materially, or meaningfully increases your ability to broaden out those test kits, and really make them more ubiquitous? How do you guys think about that? Rainer Blair : Well, thanks for the question, Scott. We're well into the application of Artificial Intelligence throughout the corporation here and to your question, also in research and development. And essentially, how we're applying it is to accelerate the development time, not only of our assays, so certainly the technical and research aspect of R&D, but also in terms of how we get. The integrated evidence plan that you need, to get that assay to-market much more quickly and broadly on-top of, of course, the decision support systems that we're building. Another example is like a Biosystems where you just saw us do a deal with Indica Biolabs, where clearly the journey takes us to digital diagnostics in pathology that is supported by artificial intelligence. Helping those pathologists to make not only faster diagnoses, but to see things that they might not normally see. So we are definitely down the path here, and investing significantly in accelerating cycle times throughout the corporation, but certainly in R&D as well. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And guys, just as a completely different follow-up, but where does Abcam and Aldevron, however, you pronounce it,, where do they sit versus the deal model when you guys close those deals? Are we still ahead of the deal model on those? It sounds like we may have taken a little bit of a step backwards, but maybe I misheard that? Rainer Blair : No, I think on Abcam, we're still pretty close. That's still pretty new, Scott, that's only about a year-old. So I think we're pretty much tracking close there, Aldevron we're behind. I don't think there's any way to say it other than that. And largely, it has to do with the end-markets of genomics are proving to take a little bit longer sort of, to round themselves out. And but ultimately, while behind on the deal model, it's disappointing working hard to make sure that we try and close that gap. But it's still a business that we are going to want to own. We need to be in genomics, we're going to be in genomics. If you're in life sciences, you have to have that presence. We feel as though that business is a fantastic business with really well-positioned to take advantage of the genomics market. When it does sort of ramp beyond the current levels, and I think it will. So for the long-term, I think it's the right business to own for sure. But we're working hard to kind of catch back up on the deal model, but I would say that we are behind, yes. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you for the integrity of that answer. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Daniel Brennan : Great. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just starting on Bioprocess for a moment, just back to Mike's question. You talked about really strong order growth in the fourth-quarter. I think you had the same thing really in the third quarter, so call it, probably maybe north of 30 or north of 20. Can you just remind us, Rainer, of the linkage between orders and the forward growth for your Bioprocess business? And is our thinking that such strong second half order growth shouldn't portend for potentially much stronger growth in '25 for revenues? Rainer Blair : Well, I mean, it certainly sets us up well. Some of our customers get their orders in very early and it has implications for the second half of 2025, and others do that with the shorter lead times that we're able to deliver on for the first half. So again, as we think about our orders development, of course, that is what is in our guide and supports our guide for the year. And we really like where we're positioned here, both competitively, but also we are seeing the recovery here clearly underway, essentially in all segments. Daniel Brennan : Okay. Got it. Okay. And then maybe just kind of a big picture question. The next five years, I know pharma patent expirations are set to grow versus the prior five. I think '28 is a particularly big year. And in your prepared remarks, you talked about the benefit of biosimilars to your bioproduction business. Just how do we think about the impact of Danaher's kind of your overall growth from these patent expirations? Are these - are these going to be more of a tailwind, or a headwind if you want to think about maybe separating between bioprocess and more R&D related areas? Thank you. Rainer Blair : Yes. Well, as we think about bioprocessing, that business is driven by volume. And it's really critical to understand that the more volume there is, the more we benefit and drive growth both top and bottom. And we're so well-positioned there. We've talked about the number of monoclonal antibodies being approved, and you can expect that we are participating in all of those. And that momentum of monoclonal antibodies going forward, which represents 75% of the business is really what drives the train. So as you think about these biosimilars, starting to penetrate other patient groups that heretofore have not been able to candidly afford to buy these kind of therapies, or even payers have been unable to pay for those kinds of therapies, that's a tailwind for us. And so, biosimilars is an important category to understand. What's interesting about biosimilars, once again, in biologics, the end product cannot be perfectly characterized. So the regulators tend to lock down the process to ensure consistency there. And so, even biosimilar manufacturers, will try to use the inputs that have been previously approved by those regulators, to ensure speed to market and a minimum of delay to getting to patients. So biosimilars, higher volumes tailwind for Danaher. Daniel Brennan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Douglas Schenkel : Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Rainer Blair : Good morning. Douglas Schenkel : So I want to start on diagnostics and then kind of pivot over to a philosophical question. So first on diagnostics. If I'm doing the math right on the respiratory headwind and the VBP incremental headwinds, I think this implies kind of what's embedded into your guidance, is an implied 5% core and normalized diagnostic growth rate. Is that right? And if not, why isn't this a little bit higher? And then when would we see evidence, of you getting back to that high-single-digit growth rate that, I believe you're still targeting? So that's the diagnostic topic. The second one, which I'll just get out of the way is the guidance philosophy question. So if you go back and look at how 2025 EPS expectations have progressed over time, if you go back to the beginning of 2023, the street was at 1,120. At the beginning of last year, the street was at around 880. Yesterday estimates were at 809. And if I'm doing the math right, I think you essentially guide it to around 760. So it's hard for a stock to work, when the estimates keep moving in the wrong direction. I'm just wondering how much does - do these things factor into your guidance philosophy this year, especially as it seems like your end markets are continuing to improve. And related to that, what are the bigger - biggest risks to guidance, from an earnings and EBITDA standpoint? And what are the biggest sources of potential upside? Thank you. Matt McGrew : Yes, sure. Let me see if I captured all that. As far as diagnostics goes, I think you're right, Doug. I mean, I think if you sort of think about diagnostics, maybe just outside of China, we are kind of mid-to-high single-digits here, for the guide. So I think you're right. I think we're pretty much in the zone of where we thought we would be. I mean, I think China is the big piece with VBP, and the respiratory headwinds. I think those are the two pieces. So I think we're pretty close to, where we thought we would be or where we aspire to be, which is, high-single-digits. So I feel pretty good about, where we are from a diagnostics perspective outside, of what we're seeing in China really and in respiratory. I guess, as far as guidance philosophy goes, I mean, I kind of - I don't necessarily look backwards. When we think about guidance and philosophy. I think we always try and do a bottoms up, what our businesses are telling us, what we are seeing and we try and incorporate that into the guidance. We do probably include some external factors like I talked about, I think in particular Life Sciences. Currently, there's been just kind of a lot of news, and maybe noise around that segment here. And I think we try to incorporate some of that news and noise into it, to be prudent, especially from a planning perspective early in the year. I want to make sure that not only for your purposes, but for my purposes internally, that we're setting the cost structure right, and we're setting expectations at a level that we can overdrive, if you will. So that's sort of our overall philosophy. I understand stock doesn't work when earnings are going down, but I would posit that there were some external things that, we had to work through in bioprocessing, as well as stimulus in China and some other things. I think we worked through them. I think we've done a pretty good job, of managing the cost structure. I think we - from a margin perspective, despite the fact that we've been down two years in a row, I really like where our margin profile is. So look, we try and build it from the bottom up. We try and tell you what we're seeing in the moment, and give you that information. That's how we've always thought about it and continue to do that. Douglas Schenkel : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe my first one - Rainer Blair : Good morning, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Rainer, I think good morning to you. I think you mentioned something around Life Science at Q1. Was there anything one-off in Q1, maybe which is different versus the rest of the year? I think you mentioned, Pall, maybe if you could elaborate on what the Q1 headwind is. We'll stop there? Rainer Blair : Look, and Pall, in the prior year, so Q1 2024, we had a very, very large tens of millions energy project and that - that's giving us a one-off effect here in the first quarter along with some of the other things we talked about, more specifically. And again, looking at the first quarter guide here, in general, the trends really remain the same, as they were in the fourth quarter with the exception of diagnostics. Matt just talked about that. So, Bioprocessing, 6% to 7% core growth, that's consistent with the Q4 exit rate. Life Sciences, that they're expected to be consistent here in the tools sector. And here we go. Pall and the rest of the segment is getting off to a slower start in the first quarter, talked about the comp here just a minute ago. But we really saw two meaningful changes in diagnostics in the fourth quarter and Matt described some of those. One was the acceleration of volume-based procurement in China and the second is a slower start to the respiratory season. You bring that together between volume-based procurement and respiratory, that's about a 350 basis point headwind versus Q1 2024. But the underlying market as we just talked about in diagnostics everywhere, are growing mid-to-high single-digits with the exception of China. So we view this as an isolated topic, and we see that in the first quarter, and certainly expect every quarter thereafter to be better. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And maybe my one follow-up on - is on capital deployment. Looks like Q1 is assuming a big share repurchase. How much of that is being contemplated in Q1 and rest of the year? And can you just remind us on - of your M&A criteria? I think there's been some chatter about deal activity picking up in the tool space. So how is the pipeline looking for you guys? Matt McGrew : Yes, Vijay. So in Q4 and in Q1 collectively, we - so we started in Q4 and then kind of spilled over into Q1, if you will. We did buy back about 8 million shares for about $1.9 billion or so. So that's - that is complete. Rainer Blair : And on the deal front, we see more activity out there, no doubt, and we see that in our funnels as well. So we're very active across all three segments, cultivating assets. And as it relates to the environment, not everywhere, but we're starting to see some pockets where valuations are getting a little bit better. So we feel very well-positioned here, Vijay, with the way our balance sheet sets up and we're going to remain disciplined as we always do around our deal philosophy. Where we have to be in the right end-market, with those secular growth drivers. I've got to like the asset or the company. And then, of course, the valuation framework, the model has to work as well. So we feel good, about where we're positioned. Markets are a little more active. The balance sheet looks good, we're going to remain disciplined. Vijay Kumar : Okay. Understood. Thank you, guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our last question from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. So I wanted to ask on some of the export control headlines that, we got earlier this month surrounding flow cytometry and mass spec. Can you walk us through are you expecting Danaher to be impacted this - by this at all? And then more conceptually, life sciences were usually viewed as a sector that was more insulated from some of these export controls. So how are you thinking about the risk here going forward? And do you expect that we could see other instruments potentially added to the list as well? Rainer Blair : Good morning, Rachel. Thanks for the question. So the current export controls that have recently been published are really not meaningful for us. Our portfolio is positioned differently. And more generally speaking, this category has required export licenses for many years. So it's really not that new for life sciences, but what they've done is expanded the category a little bit to include some other technologies. So as we go forward, I think during the normal course of any administration, these kind of export controls are regularly reviewed and adjusted. But we don't expect anything particularly different than the standard process here, and at least to-date have not seen a meaningful impact to what we do. Rachel Vatnsdal : Got it. And then my follow-up, I just have a multipart question here on Bioprocessing. So you mentioned that the recovery is underway. So how should we think about the pace of recovery throughout the year on Bioprocessing, and really what could we be exiting this year at for growth in that portion? And then other areas, just how are you thinking about some of the comps embedded? Especially in the first part of the year, you have some easy one-year comps, but also appreciate some of the multi-year stacks. And then lastly, what are you guys assuming at this point for standard seasonality by quarter on bioprocessing? Now, that's a lot in there? Thanks so much, you guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Rachel. Let me start-off with one more time that the recovery in bioprocessing is well underway, and we're really seeing it in nearly every category of the bioprocessing portfolio. So we see a positive development here throughout the year. That said, the way we've set up the guide is 6% to 7% core growth, essentially on a quarterly basis. That's how we're starting our perspective on the year here. And then, we'll see how that plays out. If you look at the multiyear stacks and that makes sense to do, you'll see that the math shows that this is right in line, with sort of a high single-digit growth rate, which is what we've talked about this market long - as its long-term growth rate. So we think that this is the right perspective, and we sure like the fact that the momentum is building here. Matt McGrew : As far as seasonality goes, Rachel, we sort of Q1 in that business is usually the kind of the lightest. We see a bit of a step-up in Q2. And we do have a phenomenon there where Q3 is lower than Q2. That's always sort of been in that business. And some of the pandemic that didn't happen, but that is a normal trajectory where we see a step down Q2 to Q3, and then obviously a step-up in Q4. So sort of Q1, is your low-point, a little bit up in Q2, down in Q3, and then a big step-up in Q4. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you, guys. Rainer Blair : Thanks, Rachel. Operator : Thank you. And it appears that we have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the program back to our presenters, for any additional or closing remarks. John Bedford : Thanks, everybody. We're around all day for questions. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
