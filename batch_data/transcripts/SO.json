Welcome to the Southern Company First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participations will be in a listen only-mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, April 30, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir. Dan Tucker : Thank you, Nelson. Welcome everyone to Southern Company\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides of this conference call. You can follow along by accessing the slides posted on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Art will go through the details in a few minutes, but first I would like to highlight two of the key drivers of our first quarter earnings growth; cold weather and continued economic growth. First, the weather story. Around the industry, much has been reported lately on the polar vortex, the Southeast experienced the second coldest first quarter in the last 20 years and we set a new all time winter peak on our system of 39,130 megawatts. While the colder than normal weather had an obvious impact on revenue, that\u2019s not the only important story. Operationally the Southern Company\u2019s system delivered on our commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and communities we serve as demonstrated by our crew\u2019s tireless work under the most challenging of circumstances to restore power to nearly 800,000 customers affected by the severe ice storm in mid February. The winter weather also underscored the importance of developing the full portfolio of energy resources. As weather-related demand and delivery challenges proved once again how volatile natural gas prices can be, Southern Company dispatched one of the industry\u2019s most diverse and the liable generation fleets, delivering more than $100 million in fuel cost savings by taking advantage of our fuel optionality. Second, the economy continues to improve. 9 of our 10 largest industrial sectors which account for approximately 80% of industrial sales reflected positive year-over-year growth for the first quarter and all 10 of them were positive in March. Combined with solid customer growth and usage growth in our residential class, we were increasingly confident in the sustained momentum of the Southeast economy. Let\u2019s turn now to our major projects. Construction progress continues at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia and at the Kemper County energy facility in Mississippi. First, tremendous progress continues in the construction of the Vogtle project which remained on schedule for the fourth quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2018 for Units 3 and 4 respectively. Nearly two months ago, as planned, we successfully executed the heaviest lift to-date placing the 2.2 million pound CA20 module into the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. Our critical path focus remains on the major elements of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island with the CA05 module scheduled to be installed in the second quarter. Other signs of our continued construction progress include the walls and concrete under the containment vessel, which will support the installation of the shield building panels later this year. Outside of the Nuclear Island, we continue to progress on the major other elements including the cooling tower and turbine building. We are also very pleased with the progress on both the Unit 4. The CR-10 module, commonly known as the cradle was placed in the Nuclear Island during the first quarter and the containment vessel\u2019s bottom head is scheduled to be set in May. In February, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Dr. Ernie Moniz joined us as the Vogtle site to commemorate America\u2019s first loan guarantee for nuclear construction. The DOE loan provides a committed source of funds that reduces financial risk, while delivering an estimated $250 million and present value benefit to Georgia Power customers. These savings should translate to lower base rates for customers over the life of the loan. Including the DOE loan benefits, Georgia Power highlighted $2.3 billion of customer benefits in the combined 9th and 10th VCM report filed at the end of February. This came on the heels of the favor vote by the Georgia PSE to verify and improve the actual capital cost reflected in the 8th VCM. The current VCM report, which reflects $389 million of actual 2013 spending is expected to be voted on by the commission in August. Turning now to the Kemper project, where we are winding down construction and ramping up our start-up activity. We continue to work toward our next major milestone, the heat up of the first gasifier, which is now scheduled for mid to late summer. Additionally, we expect to place the combined cycle portion of the plan in the commercial operation this summer. As we mentioned last quarter, the start-up activity for the combined cycle are largely complete and it is expected to be able to serve customer\u2019s energy need during the upcoming peak season. As we shared in our most recent disclosure, we\u2019ve experienced decreases in construction labor productivity due to a combination of adverse weather, labor turnover and inefficiencies. Having assessed the impact of these issues and the risks that additional unanticipated factors could have on the construction and start-up of the project, we\u2019ve recorded an additional pre-tax charge of $380 million. This estimate includes the previously disclosed $184 million in increased labor and weather related expenses and additional $135 million due to the extension of the expected in service date and 61 million of incremental construction costs as an adjustment to the earlier number. Our confidence remains high in the value of the TRIG technology and the entire Kemper project to Mississippi Power\u2019s customers. Our ongoing commitment to safety and quality is a primary importance as we focus on completing construction of this first of a kind plant and working through instrumentation and controls integration that is critical for the project success. Meanwhile, Southern Power continues to expand its generation portfolio. Recently Southern Power closed on the 20 megawatt Adobe Solar Facility, our second solar plant in California. This brings Southern Power\u2019s solar portfolio to approximately 222 megawatts, all with quality, long term contracts. We continue to work diligently on additional projects and hope to announce another solar acquisition very soon. Looking ahead, we remain confident in Southern Power\u2019s ability to execute its business plans for remainder of the year. I will now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic review. Art Beattie : Thanks Tom. For the first quarter of 2014, we earned $0.39 per share compared to $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.30 per share. Included in these results for the first quarter of 2014 is an after tax charge against earnings of $235 million or $0.27 per share related to the current cost estimate for Kemper as detailed in the 8-K we filed yesterday. Included in the 2013 results are after tax charges of $333 million or $0.38 per share for increased cost of the Kemper project and $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment. Excluding these items, we earned $0.66 per share in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.17 per share. The major factors which influenced our year-over-year adjusted earnings were weather, economic growth and retail revenue effects at our traditional operating companies. A detailed summary of the earnings drivers can be found in our slide deck for this call. Weather in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter of 2013, added $0.08 per share to our earnings. Weather was $0.07 above normal for the first quarter of 2014, compared with $0.01 below normal for the first quarter of 2013. Average temperatures were almost 5 degrees below normal and as a result, we saw the second highest number of heating degree days in 20 years. Total weather normal retail sales for the first quarter of 2014 increased 1.3% compared with the first quarter of 2013. Our original forecast was based on a GDP growth estimate of between 2.5% and 2.7%. While it\u2019s still early in the year, it appears as though GDP growth estimates could actually be between 2.7% and 3%. Weather normal residential sales increased 1.2% over the first quarter of 2013. Residential sales were positively affected in almost equal parts by an increase in usage, reflecting demand growth beyond the amount avoided through energy efficiency, and the addition of 10,000 new customers in the first quarter of 2014. The first quarter industrial sales increased 2.8% compared with the first quarter of 2013, continuing the strong performance and momentum seen for 10 straight months. Manufacturing employment growth in our service territories exceeded the national pace in a first quarter that featured growth that was very broad-based. Some specific examples of segments that performed particularly well were primary metals and transportation, which grew at 6.4% and 6% respectively. In addition housing related segments including stone clay and glass, textiles and lumber as group grew approximately 6% year-over-year. This positive momentum was also evident at the port of Savannah where container exports increased 8.1% over the first quarter of 2013. Finally, one of the best leading indicators is economic development activity. The pipeline remains robust with 340 potential projects that could deliver 30,000 more jobs and generate more than $11 billion in additional capital investment. This reflects a 58% increase in projects, a 46% increase in potential jobs and a 107% increase in potential capital investment, compared with the same period last year. This potential is on top of a very strong quarter of announcements, which are expected to create an additional 3,000 additional jobs and represents $4.5 billion in new capital investment. Before turning the call back over to Tom, I\u2019d like to share two additional items. First, as we have shared many times over the years, Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity including our single A credit rating. This commitment has served our customers and shareholders well by providing low cost financing and beneficial access to the capital markets. Our plan to issue equity, which included a total of $1.3 billion of new equity over the 2013 and 2014 time frame contemplated additional risks for the Kemper project. As a result and based on all of our current assumptions, we do not anticipate the need to increase our equity issuances due to the new charges reflected in our earnings results. We continuously monitor our capital structure and relevant credit metrics. As conditions change whether it is unexpected cost or better than expected success in acquiring new project at Southern Power. We will reforecast our equity needs as necessary. Finally, I'd like to share with you our earnings per share estimate for the second quarter of 2014, which is $0.66 per share. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Art. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors voted to increase Southern Company\u2019s common dividend to an annualize rate of $2.10 per share an increase of approximately 3.5%. This marks the 13th consecutive year that our dividend is increased. In fact since 2002, our dividend has increased a total of 57%. This track record is a direct reflection of the strength of our business model and the region our company serves. We have the privileged of serving 4.4 million customers in a region with an improving economy and a stable constructive regulatory environment. Our value proposition is bolstered by our ability to deliver industry leading customer satisfaction, lower electricity prices and the highest level of reliability. In fact, the success of our customer focused strategy and how well this positioned the company to earned top quartile returns and generate strong operating cash flow over the long-term is the underpinning of our Board\u2019s dividend action. Despite our challenges with the Kemper project. Our performance during the first quarter is a direct results of the sustaining successes, we produced elsewhere in our business during 2013. We will continue our focus on providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to customers and the communities we serve which supports our value proposition objectives for investors. We are now ready to take your questions. So operator, we'll now take the first question. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Greg. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Good afternoon, guys. How are you? Tom Fanning :  Super. Hope you are well. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Thank you, I am. So in reading through your 8-K on Kemper there was also a section where you discussed because of the decision to delay to start up to May 15th a reduction in bonus depreciation. So in order for you guys to not have to sort of pin that on the shareholder what now has to happen on the regulatory front? Art Beattie : Yes, Greg, it's Art. As a number of things that could happen. That is not part of any of the write-off amount that we have included in the numbers today. We are in the process of working with regulators in Mississippi to reach what we think will be a global settlement of prudents and issues related to our seven year rate plan. Now with the loss of bonus depreciation, we will certainly have to rework the seven year rate plan assuming that that bonus depreciation is lost and we will come back and address that in a minute, in order to make sure that we don\u2019t violate tax modernization rules. So that\u2019s an absolute requirement. Now when we think about bonus depreciation there is a couple of item avenues here; one could be that, we get an extended bill coming out of congress that extends bonus depreciation in the \u201815, so that would take care of it on its own. Secondly there could be issues in our global settlement whereby we mitigate the impact on customers. So all of these things are in kind of a settlement stage with the commission as we address how we will help that through the regulatory process. Tom Fanning : One other point we anticipate. You know that we produce electricity during I think in January made about a $1 million in revenue at the combined cycle. We expect that to go into dispatch this summer and go into service, as that goes into service that eliminates a flood of the bonus depreciation at [rents]. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Combine cycles are running off, our natural gas plant (inaudible) rate in the plan now? Tom Fanning : Right. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Got it. One more question on the negative side and then a positive one. So on the Vogtle we haven\u2019t heard much on sort of the trending what\u2019s going on and important investor with regard to your case against CBI, more we heard any progress publically on the potential settlement, can you give us an update on where that stands and whether or not the costs, all things equal, notwithstanding the overrun that you're dealing with there have been staying pretty steady and on track? Tom Fanning : Yes, Greg, I'm not sure, there is going to be much of a substantive update, it would be roughly the same we've been telling you. Essentially, we have venue in Augusta, we have, I think askings by both the Consortium and us with respect to the dispute. I think the issue resides more clearly within the Consortium right now, they have issues to work out among and between themselves that's Toshiba, Westinghouse, and Shaw. But we have constructive conversation with those folks all the time. In fact, I want to say next week, Philip Asherman, the CEO of Chicago Bridge and Iron, I think the Head of Westinghouse, representatives from Toshiba, Georgia Power Management, Southern Company Management we are all meeting at Plant Vogtle. We do that regularly just a kind of cut through any of the issue, in order to continue to advance project as well as it has been. So, I guess the point is we continue to have a very good relationship and I think we have said before, it's much better now when Shaw is out and Chicago Bridge and Iron is in. We'll see, it could happen quickly or it could happen late. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Great. And my final question is I'm noticing and it's not just you guys, but we're on the front-end of earnings, but there's been a handful of companies where their weather-normal sales growth numbers in the first quarter tracked ahead of the baseline expectation for the full year. Are we seeing just a little bit more of a bounce in the economy than you had modeled because you wanted to be conservative or is there some friction in your weather normalization model, when you have really extreme moves in weather that was the explanation one or the other managements gave, they are not sure that they are getting an accurate weather normal reading because it was such a big, such a strong weather quarter. So is it, we are definitively trending better or is that we won\u2019t really know till we get a few more quarters ahead? Art Beattie : Yes, Greg it is Art. And I have always said that weather normalization is more of an art than the science. But when we look at industrial sales, industrial sales are largely not weather normalized. So when we have a 2.8% increase in industrial sales that\u2019s a very good strong indicator. And as we have talked about in our remarks earlier, that\u2019s the 10th month in a row we\u2019ve had year-over-year growth in our industrial sales. So that is not impacted by what you brought up. Now on the residential side, we could be seeing a little bit of that, but it is only one quarter growth, we did have a 0.5% growth in the fourth quarter. So, if it\u2019s not 1.3, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a whole lot less than that due to the fact that we have got extreme cold temperature. Tom Fanning :  And my position with the fed, the fed was more bullish than we were, as we developed our annual guidance and just as of the first quarter, here again one quarter does not a year tail, but it does indicate that kind of economic, the macroeconomic effects or more closely 2.7 to 3 in terms of GDP than they were, our 2.5 to 2.7. So we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s a good start. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Great. Thank you guys. Tom Fanning :  Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital. Please proceed. Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital : Hey Tom, hey Art how are you? Tom Fanning : Hey Jim. Good. Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital : Hey I am confused and don\u2019t comment on that. So, your second quarter last year was $0.66 and you\u2019re guiding to $0.66 for the second quarter this year. What might be some of the big mechanics that would at least, under that condition would put you at the high-end of your $2.72 to $2.80 guidance range for 2014? Art Beattie : Yes, good question Jim. When you look at non-fuel O&M and I think we outlined this on our last call, we estimated we\u2019re going to spend roughly $300 million more at least in our regulated core business than we did in 2013. And if you look at our spending in the first quarter, it was only up year-over-year about 1.3%. So, we\u2019ve got some heavier lift to do on the expense side for the remainder of the year and when you look at our outage schedule, it is somewhat back-end loaded as well. There are few other elements, at least in the quarter-over-quarter numbers that you need to remember. Alabama Power had entered into an accounting order that allowed them to differ some non-nuclear outage cost this year which will make their non-fuel O&M look a little lower year-over-year and that\u2019s a big influence on the first quarter non-fuel O&M numbers. But when you look at the O&M that we\u2019re going to add this year, at least in the second quarter along with new rates and you don\u2019t take normal weather, you\u2019re seeing about the flattish kind of equation there. Tom Fanning : Jim, Art and I talked about this stuff all the time. It\u2019s not -- don\u2019t be ashamed to be confused, we have the same questions here. But I think it really does go to our pattern of O&M being roughly flat for the first quarter that presumed you\u2019re going to spend a lot more in the rest of the year. So, I think that really kind of does go there. Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital : Okay. But I\u2019m glad the same way and I\u2019m still confused on Kemper County now if you don\u2019t mind me changing topics. So, I just need to be -- my memory needs to be refreshed. So, if the gasifier goes into service, let\u2019s just call September 1st. How do the mechanics work under all that if you\u2019re a customer of Mississippi Power, who benefits? Tom Fanning :  The economic to Mississippi\u2019s customers are relatively fixed. In other words, there is $2.4 billion that they accrue; they had a full mix of capital up to 288. It\u2019s the (inaudible). Art Beattie :  Jim, you said gasifier, did you mean the combustion turbines? Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital : I\u2019m sorry. Yes, I did say gasifier, I apologize. Tom Fanning :  No, I\u2019m okay. Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital : Combustion turbines; I'm sorry. That's my mistake. Art Beattie :  No, no problem. Tom Fanning : Well, I mean a lot of how that might work is tied up in this global settlement as well. There is a host of issues; in fact there was some language in the recent continuance of discussions which indicated that there is some conversation going on between the company and the staff. So, I would like look for all of that to be kind of handled as much as it could in that settlement. Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital : Any idea on the timing when that might happen? Tom Fanning :  Not really, but look forward in the months ahead here. Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital : Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning :  Yes, sir. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Hey good afternoon. Tom Fanning :  Hey Dan. How are you doing? Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : I am doing great, thank you. You guys when you kind of talked about the growth rate update last quarter and you pointed to the back-end of this decade, the reacceleration environmental CapEx part of that being coal ash some other things. We\u2019ve seen some other folks in the region have some issues around coal ash. I wonder if you could just kind of walk through maybe in a little more detailed spending that you guys have there and kind of how that paces out with more scrutiny. Does that change the timeline for when you guys may start spending that money? Tom Fanning : I am going to turn this over to Art in a second, but if I think you kind of globally look at it here, we kind of have $6 billion of future environmental compliance investments that will manifest themselves at the end of the decade. Certainly coal ash is part of that, certainly affluent guideline, certainly 316(b). There are a lot of moving parts there and the number can move pretty dramatically both in terms of the quantum, again our estimated $6 billion, as well as the timing. And it would not surprise us, but that these other issues could have some bearing hands to the ultimate resolution for a company like us. We are following it very closely and we will see. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Okay. And I guess on the Casper decision where it is right now, is that going to have any effect on near-term spending or is the mass obligations pretty well covered for you guys? Art Beattie : Dan, the mass contemplates most of that, I think when the original Casper was passed it was prior to the development or finalization the (inaudible) so since they both directed it, SO2 and NOx, most of that will be addressed through SCRs, through scrubbers or to whatever other compliance equipment we may have added to the unit. There maybe some small change dispatch of some of the units, the smaller coal units that are further back in the stack and won\u2019t operate a lot. And so, the only real impact made the fuel cost on an extreme depth. Tom Fanning : Yes. It is much more a dispatch energy issue than a capital issue for us. The math already spoke to the capital. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Okay. So, one more on coal, we've heard a few people talking about little more concern about coal inventories for the summer after the cold winter having to run the coal fleet hard. Where do you guys sit on your coal inventories in, how is that they\u2019re going to get, captured if you have to start buying more actively in the open market to the fuel mechanisms? Tom Fanning : It's fascinating, we made a big play in the past we talked a lot about 70% coal six years ago, 16% gas now. What we said before was 45% gas, 35% coal. Fascinating, average gas prices during the first quarter of \u201814 were 5 bucks in round numbers. First quarter \u201813, they were $350, so you are up almost 50% in gas prices with coal prices being relatively constant. So, what that\u2019s done is we\u2019ve been able to shift our dispatch around to save our customers about a $100 million. So, we\u2019re marginally more on coal and gas is what we saw in the first quarter kind of 42 coal 38 gas. It's fascinating to kind of think about how that may roll out for the rest of the year. Art Beattie : Dan, when you think about our inventories, we are very close to the targets we've set for ourselves this year. We are building up coal supply to meet the summer peak demands. And that will basically runs our average target to up to 35, from 35 45 days. So, we are just in the process right now of rebuilding after we increased our burns quite a bit of first quarter, above what we thought it would be. Tom Fanning :  And that moves around a lot from plant to plant, obviously if we have plants like the branch unit that we\u2019re planning to close a little bit later, you will treat those a little bit differently than you will kind of ball win or a share or a (inaudible). Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse :  Got it. Thank you, guys. Tom Fanning :  Yes sir, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Tom Fanning :  Hey Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research :  Hey Tom just a follow-up on that last question. Would you, is it fair to characterize that you are running gas more maybe in the shorter months, so that you can rebuilt the coal piles or is it just you\u2019re just running dispatchers normally word and you just bring him more coal in? Art Beattie : Yes, we're in great shape, we are running normal. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research :  Okay. Just maybe if you could spend a little more time you mentioned that you\u2019re starting to work on settlement and Mississippi of various issues. Could you disclose or remind us what the issues are, is it both the good indication that you got, that you trying to kind of wrap altogether? And timelines and how much your are people cut on board together, is there going to be a lot opposition, likelihood that you able to get a settlement? Art Beattie : Well, we think there is an opportunity for both the regulators and the companies to come out with some kind of agreement here. The 7 year rate plan was designed to recover cost and keep rates at the set level that we agreed to in January of \u201813 and that was a 15% increase in rates last year followed on by 3% rate increase this year, both of which are in place. So, as these numbers move around, as our in service state moves around, we\u2019re going to have to amend that to make sure that we comply with tax normalization rules as I mentioned. So that\u2019s one element. And there are some other pieces of the pie that we might be able to include in the ground settlement that will keep customers [on those] in this agreement. But it\u2019s mostly focused around those two very issues, 7 year rate plan and the prudency issue. We would like to get those solved on a simultaneous basis. Tom Fanning : And I guess just roll into that the in service of the combined cycle. We fully expect those to run. They\u2019re actually attractive and we\u2019ve actually had some interest in the wholesale markets for those things. All this could be round up together we think in a beneficial discussion. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : And just timing of this and\u2026? Tom Fanning : It\u2019s always hard to predict those things. We\u2019ve got the continuance order. Let that play out and let events take their course. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay. And then separately on Vogtle, I might have missed this in your presentation but is there any updates on the schedule for the Vogtle units and if not when will we get the next schedule update? Art Beattie : As we filed in our VCM 9 and 10, we reiterated our plan to leave the schedule in place, CLD dates for Unit 3 fourth quarter of \u201817, Unit 4 fourth quarter of \u201818. And we did not change the amount that we are contemplating in terms of overnight costs at the same time. Tom Fanning : And if you just go back Steve to the VCM 8 filings, that is our most recent schedule. Now of course we always continue to move things around within but that\u2019s it. And I would argue that probably Unit 4 is actually probably a little bit ahead. So we feel very good about our schedule right now. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay. And just timing commentary from SCANA which obviously different units. But can you talk about having kind of a new schedule from the E&C guys in the fall to layout? Is that a time line that\u2019s relevant for you at all, are you just on a separate track? Tom Fanning : It's interesting. I mean we try to work together to coordinate that practices and share information and a variety of other things. But it is very clear that we have a different contract. And without commenting on their situation, I can tell you that our contract as we suggested in the past is essentially fixed with performance schedules that are also fixed. So, I wouldn't spend a lot of time comparing say for example CA20 for us and CA20 for them. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay. Tom Fanning : You will have -- they are operating under a different regime than we are. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks Tom. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Tom Fanning :  Hey Michael. Art Beattie :  Hey Mike. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs :  Hey guys. Can you hear me? Tom Fanning :  Yes. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Okay, thank you. Sorry, having a little phone issue. Couple of questions, if I look at your fourth quarter 2013 slide deck and went back to the appendix just at the CapEx by subsidiary, can you just walk us through -- and a lot of this is Kemper driven but a little of it may also be Southern Power driven. Just what\u2019s different from the CapEx you laid out for 2014 through \u201816 back on slide 25 of your fourth quarter deck versus what it is today when you look forward for the next couple of years? Art Beattie : Well, Kemper will change a bit as we push more dollars into \u201815 now. And when I think about all the other companies, nothing has really changed that I\u2019m aware of. Our plan for Southern Power remains, some of that is capital for maintenance and other capital for our expansion point. So when I think broadly about that Michael, I just can\u2019t see a lot of change that is occurred since that day. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Okay. And so what\u2019s the -- I just want to make sure I am getting Kemper right. What\u2019s the remaining amount of CapEx at Kemper for 2014, meaning second quarter through the end of the year and then is the amount -- is that $25 million a month number for 2015 kind of still the good number, so four or five months into 2015? Art Beattie : Yes. If you look at it, we got about $925 million remaining; about 800 of that in \u201814 and the remainder, the 125 would be five months in 2015. Tom Fanning : That\u2019s the 25 a month. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : And maintenance CapEx is a little bit $100 million, $150 million, so that will get total Mississippi Power? Art Beattie : That is correct. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Okay. On nuclear construction question, just curious is there any insight or any update you can provide from the folks in China, who are couple of years ahead of us in the process in terms of building new nuclear plants? Just any updates on kind of the construction timeline for either Sandman or the other units that are coming on line there that are using AP1000? Tom Fanning : Sandman and [Haiyang] you know that we have people that live there. And other various members of our team go there from time to time. It's interesting to think about how that's helped us. Some of it -- I would argue the very first benefit that we've seen out of all them going first and our people on-site have been supply chain related. I would argue also the way that some of the material was handled on site, once it is fabricated has been helpful for us. We've had better performance than they have. There are some significant differences, particularly in the late end construction, where when you think about for example module, you think about how these things are racked, they tend to be much more people intensive than we are. Our processes tend to be much more automated. The other thing that we find is where they have a specific problem, can we learn from it? Well, I'll tell you one, the way some of the panels were erected, they erected them horizontally. When they were picked up, they deformed a little bit and they had to worry about correcting that. What we learned was to erect to them vertically, so we didn't have that kind of deformation. The other thing is just kind of issues that relate to the engineering around some pieces of equipment, I know one issue has been reactor coolant pump. I know one that\u2019s in service in China, we have that equipment, it will be resolved to our satisfaction well in advanced of any critical path. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs :  Got it. Okay guys, thank you very much and appreciate the update. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Thank you for calling in. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Tom Fanning :  Hey, Paul. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Good afternoon. How are you? Tom Fanning :  Super. Hope you are well. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc:  Thank you. You\u2019ve mentioned some little room in your equity forecast, I mean is there continued pressures at Kemper, is there still contingency built in there? Art Beattie :  We are probably on the cost, if we have additional cost then we may need, it depends on any other offsetting issues, either in CapEx or that might affect our equity needs, but we\u2019ll keep an eye on that over time and certainly advise you of any needs we may have. Again our target Paul is 44% equity ratio and right now we're solid in that range. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc:  As I administered, you didn\u2019t address annual guidance on the call? Tom Fanning :  We almost never do that, what we do is we do annual guidance twice a year, we do it once in January that sums up kind of where we believe we will be for the year, and then as been our practice really since I was CFO, so we're dialing back eight years or so now. We only do a revision annual guidance once we get through the third quarter, so it\u2019s typically our October phone call. What we provide is just quarterly estimates beyond that. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc:  Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed. Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies: Good afternoon guys. Tom Fanning : Hi Anthony. Anthony Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies: Just following up on Paul's question, I think the guidance for equity in '13 and '14 was roughly about $1.3 billion. How much of that has been issued already? Art Beattie :  In the first quarter we issued right at the $140 million so we\u2019re on track for our $600 million number this year. Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies: And I guess lastly, when you think of Kemper and you guys have quantified maybe 2015 roughly $25 million a month I guess, over budget or incremental charges, what do you think is the biggest risk on cost overruns there? I mean it seems like there\u2019s been a labor issue, last quarter you spoke about and also this quarter, what\u2019s the biggest issue I guess with or sensitivity with higher cost at Kemper? Tom Fanning : So I think it remains, we\u2019ve been very confident on that. When you transition away from construction to start up that\u2019s kind of the lion share of risk ahead of us now. The integration of the different systems of Kemper, it\u2019s a very complex animal in a combined cycle unit you may have three systems that need integration. Recall this one is coal gasification, it is gas handling equipment and all those related things, it\u2019s about 13 different systems. I mean I\u2019d like to think of it like fine tuning a 6 cylinder car versus a 12 cylinder car. So just getting the integration of the various systems through start up is the biggest issue. Beyond that it is I think the unknown, unknown there is always something that could happen and nobody can contemplate. We, I think are allowing for normal disruptions through start-up you have those anyway it\u2019s something that nobody has foreseen we\u2019ll see. When we rethought this schedule I can tell you we did a lot of soul-searching about it. You know from following us that we're a conservative company we always try and take a long view. And I think it is absolutely the right thing to do in our judgment to adjust this schedule. Because even though it produces some near-term pain, this is absolutely the long-term trajectory that represents best interest for our customer. And it\u2019s so important that we get it right at the outset. So that's what you see us doing here. Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies: Just lastly like a really weird question more like to your point unknown, unknown, it seems like the conventional part of the Kemper unit or Kemper plant CCGT whatever is working fine, you\u2019ve produced electric first quarter. Are there any changes to that seven-year rate plan you guys entered into back in January of '13, if the gasifier just for some reason just doesn\u2019t really reach commercial operation as intended? Tom Fanning : There is nothing in the seven year rate plan, that is contemplated around that. But I will remind you Anthony that we have a lot of experience with our pilot project. Whereby we have overtime protected the operation of the gasifier. So our confident in the gasifier and having problems with it, is not high on the list. But as Tom mentioned, we have the gas clean up island, so we\u2019ve got to be able to continually integrate the gasifier, the clean up island and collection of the bio product and delivery of the reliable syngas in order to make sure that this plant operates as intend. And as know we talk about this in the past, where we made mistakes I think on this project, was entering into a fixed price commitment back like 2009 or so, with only 10% of the engineering and I think where we did the feed studies and all we were very good in terms of what combined cycle allowance is going to cost and how the gasifier where we got bit was in the gas handling systems remember as we ramped up or carbon capture profile quantity and the type, the quality and the type, hangers and all the related equipment, it\u2019s going to be that we had a lack of experience. The good news is we do have expenses to gasifier, we have the combine cycles already working. We know that the gas management system exists elsewhere, so my sense is all these component will work that\u2019s my judgment integrating them and optimizing them and time tuning them is going to be the challenge. Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies: Great, thanks for the color, guys. I really appreciated. Tom Fanning : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar Equity Research. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Mark. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Equity Research : Hey, good afternoon guys, how are you? Tom Fanning : Great. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Equity Research : You talked a lot about Kemper and Vogtle. Can I just ask a couple quick questions around Southern Power to round it out? You mentioned you might have something coming down the pipe pretty soon here in terms of another solar project. Assuming that that is the case would that largely speak for the placeholder that you have in your CapEx guidance for the optional Southern Power projects for the year? Art Beattie :  Yes, we had outlined Mark about, I think it was a 100 megawatts expansion in 2014 and roughly what we\u2019re talking about is somewhere near half of that, that with we've got other projects that we\u2019ve got on our list as well. So, we feel very good about our plan, our expansion plan for this year and for next. Tom Fanning : Yes, every Board meeting or update the finance committee with essentially a red, yellow, green list of potential projects. Looking at the health of those development activities, we have a lot of confidence on Southern Power's ability to execute this year. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Equity Research :  Great. And just one nitpicky detail on the quarterly results for Southern Power, despite the topline growth you had some lower profitability on the operating line, I'm just curious is that sort of a one-time thing or was there anything in particular that was driving that? Tom Fanning : We had some solar contracts who are (inaudible) some energy margins, I guess from the contracts with solar plants that were in service say midyear, last year, mid to late last year, that quarter-over-quarter increased revenues. But we also had a onetime tax issue that occurred, that was really a big help too. And had we not have the onetime tax issue, we may have been at or just below the -- our target for the quarter. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Equity Research :  Okay, makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that. Tom Fanning : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed. Ali Agha - SunTrust:  Thank you. Good afternoon. Tom Fanning : Hey, good afternoon to you. Ali Agha - SunTrust:  Thank you. Tom, when do you think you're in a position on Kemper to really lock down these costs? And tell us, look, this is it, and I think we don\u2019t expect any more overruns. Tom Fanning : Hey Ali, I would say could have done that a year ago, every time that we have given you an estimate, it has been our best judgment. When things happen that we can\u2019t foresee we have to adjustments, I hate that but that isn\u2019t fact the case, every time we\u2019ve given an estimate it has been our best judgment at the time. Ali Agha - SunTrust:  But is there anything in this remaining months to a year for completion where once you cross that line, you can say okay, it's pretty much done or will it go all the way to the end? Tom Fanning : Well, I mean except for the unknown unknowns right, I mean so, what happens if I mean having forbid there is a tornado that comes across the side, or what happen if there is a major hurricane or what happens if as we integrate the system and just more complex, there is, we are not able to track it effectively or something, everything I know right now, I have great confidence in our ability to execute, we really fought a lot with each other over this latest adjustment, we would still effort our best to get this done in \u201814, but I think given the bawl wave of uncertainty that we were creating by the delay in productivity on the construction as a result of polar vortex one, two and some of the other issues, it just seem to us to be a conservative, prudent, judgment to push the schedule out to make, or I wish I could give you certainty that\u2019s not the nature of the base when you built something like this. Ali Agha - SunTrust:  Right, also\u2026 Art Beattie : Hi, this is Art. Couple additional elements there and I think we\u2019ve kind of mentioned them already that you\u2019ve got milestones at there, the first gets fire heat up. We get by that we\u2019re producing syngas and then beyond that is making sure that the gasoline of island is doing its job and that we get reliable syngas that we can burn in our combined cycle. So as we move through those elements. Those are elements of milestones that we\u2019ve set for ourselves that will tell the tail you about where we identify issues. Ali Agha - SunTrust: Enough. Separately, Tom I think in the past you have told us for planning purposes for next three years or so we should assume relatively flat earnings profile for 7 power if I recall correctly, anything change on that front as you\u2019re looking at opportunities today versus few months ago? Tom Fanning : So not a significant change, but we continue to kick over every stone we can, we mentioned before that we\u2019re looking in some other regions of the United States in order to identify opportunities. It will be fun to see how the nation\u2019s so called organized market develop this year and next. My sense is when you look around the different regions of the United States particularly in the so called organized markets where you see coal plant shutdowns there maybe needs for more capital investment. I think our model long-term bilaterals, creditworthy counterparties, no fuel risk, no transmission risk is the kind of economic commercial model that will support the kind of CapEx that needs to be brought there to those markets. My sense is particularly with our focus on coal ops in municipal utilities we have some potential to do more than we think we can do. And I can assure you that I guess we had Southern Power two weeks ago, I can assure you that we give them a high goal every time we can. The other thing that could have some play in that, you maybe aware that Georgia Power then I guess second its phase, their advanced solar initiative, they had one I think it was 2010 that\u2019s called ASI and this was called ASI Prime or something. But it accounts for 525 megawatts of new solar in Georgia, 425 of which is central station and 100 megawatts of which is distributed generation. We have challenged both of our companies; Southern Power and Georgia Power Wholesale, separate from Southern Power to compete in those businesses, especially with distributed generation around the United States, a lot of people have taken the posture kind of sliding it. Our view is, let\u2019s do it right, let\u2019s create the right pricing mechanism for the energy and capacity, let\u2019s create the right pricing mechanism one that is fair to all customers for connection to the network and let\u2019s create the right mechanism for back-up generation. Having done that if customers want it, my view is we should provide it. And so I\u2019ve directed folks inside Southern, and in fact we\u2019re competing with ourselves to play off into that environment. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how those bids turn out, that\u2019s another potential source of growth for us. Ali Agha - SunTrust: Got it. Last question, Tom you\u2019ve also indicated to us in the past as you look at your earnings profile being more back-end loaded in terms of growth, you would have looking at opportunities to fill that gap if you found them out there. Today are you seeing those opportunities, I mean we saw \u201copportunistic transaction\u201d that was announced this morning. Are you seeing opportunities out there for yourselves? Tom Fanning : Was that an M&A question? Ali Agha - SunTrust: Well, I think the way you had posted to us, yes; I\u2019m presuming it\u2019s M&A. Tom Fanning : Okay. So, with us we do asset acquisitions all the time, I mean that\u2019s one of our ways. If you\u2019re talking about corporate M&A, it was interesting, I was -- we were listening to the different shows this morning; CNBC and Bloomberg and all that. A bullish thing on the economy is how much M&A is going on and in fact there seems to be a pretty good bid of it, Exelon and Pepco the latest example in our industry. I\u2019ve bid on record for this and I bet you guys on the call to give this speech, as well as I can. But this is something that we have a fiduciary obligation always to evaluate, we are always kind of, we have a group of people who competitive and intelligence group here focusing on those deals. My sense is now as it has been forever that those deals are extraordinarily difficult to do, particularly in a regulated environment where for the amount of premium that you will spend in order to acquire the target, you are going to have to earn a return on and return out capital. That from an EVA standpoint is positive for shareholders. Add to that regulatory complexity and a variety of other things, those are just hard to do. We work hard to try and make sense of them. But I can tell you it\u2019s just really hard and I wouldn\u2019t particularly count on them right now. Ali Agha - SunTrust: Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hello Kit. Kit Konolige - BGC: Good afternoon guys. Art Beattie : Hi Kit. Kit Konolige - BGC: So, just to revisit the Mississippi settlement talk one last time, can I ask who initiated the talks and what were the circumstances of their being settlement talks in the first place? Art Beattie : Yes Kit, I believe the commission in and around the prudency hearing had pushed the dates of the hearing along with the staff, we\u2019re able to push those hearings out into August. And in some of their public remarks they mentioned the fact that they were looking for discussions towards some kind of agreement both on the prudency issue on the seven year right plan. So, that\u2019s kind of where it all started from and we\u2019re certainly a party to those as well. Tom Fanning : Since we put the commission directed the staff to engage the company with potential settlement talks. So, we\u2019ll see how it goes. Kit Konolige - BGC: Right. Okay, got that. And I mean obviously we don\u2019t know until there is not a settlement, but it sounds like you would hope that this could be a pretty comprehensive deal if you got there. Would you envision it as kind of accounting for any future possible further overruns or delays in the time table of the Kemper? Art Beattie : I think it\u2019s just too early to tell, Kit. There is the prudency issue is important the seven year right plan is pretty important. But there could be other elements to the agreement as well. Tom Fanning : The in service treatment of the combined cycle unit going forward. Kit Konolige - BGC: Yes. Tom Fanning :  And there is a host of things, how you would [wait] together with [path] is important. So, we\u2019ll try and get as comprehensive, as we can. Kit Konolige - BGC:  Okay. One last thing so I kind of understand this. So obviously given your prior agreement, there can\u2019t be any further rate increases for customers as a result of this. Are we looking at potentially some change in the pattern of future rate increases? In other words, from a financial point of view for shareholders, what could change as a result of a settlement here? Tom Fanning : Yes. Kit, I\u2019m a little reluctant to kind of dive into profiles and what is, let the talks happen and let\u2019s give a good results for everybody here. Kit Konolige - BGC:  Okay. Sounds fair to me. Thank you. Tom Fanning :  Thank you Kit. Art Beattie :  Thank you Kit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed. Tom Fanning :  Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS:  Hey, good afternoon. Tom Fanning :  Hey, good afternoon to you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Excellent. So quick question here, just following-up a little bit on the same wane of thought. Can you walk through how you think about the in service criteria for Kemper regime, and how that process works in Mississippi? I know you talk about a settlement here, but I suppose that\u2019s technically a separate process that we're going to be going through down the line. And then also perhaps a little bit of the key dates as far as that goes, particularly I\u2019m thinking in contrast to some of the performance issues we\u2019ve seen elsewhere. Tom Fanning :  Yes, look in service has some [concentration] both for tax and for regulatory purposes. For tax purposes, it\u2019s essentially that you are integrated into the grid and you can demonstrate. We\u2019ve already demonstrated we can run Tampa to help during peak periods; we did that during Vogtle. And it\u2019s fun to actually have a live shot of the construction sites to both Vogtle and Kemper in my office and it\u2019s fun to see the cooling towers at Kemper blowing off steam, showing that they\u2019re generating electricity. We expect them to be fully integrated this summer. By the same token when we think about the gasifier island and everything else, I think the standard will kind of go to a reliable supply of same gas to the combined cycle units. Those will be kind of the standards we\u2019ll be looking for. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: And so that basically that\u2019s down the line here after May 15, to sort of\u2026 Tom Fanning : Again, the combined cycle as we expect the in services summer, declared in service both for tax and books. And for the gasifier and gas cleanup system, it will come probably later. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Okay, excellent. And then kind of going back to the equity question, sorry to have this one more time. If you don\u2019t end up getting either those two options with regards to making up the bonus D&A benefits, does that push you through the contingency you put in there or did that your comment before contemplate that as well? Art Beattie : It contemplated that as well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Got you. And then could you quantify how much contingency left or you don\u2019t do that? Art Beattie : We\u2019re pretty close to the edge so, but again it\u2019s a function of more than just Kemper, there is lots of other CapEx that we spend. And so it would also impact how we\u2019re doing in that regard as well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: I know you guys have spoken about, just the last subject here on coal ash. Obviously some adjacent states are kind of picking up the speed of reform on that. What are you seeing right now on your front as far as the need to spend and address both from a capital and expense perspective? Tom Fanning :  We've had a very constructive relationship with all of our environmental regulators. In all of our states we meet or exceed all of the environmental regulations that are currently in place. We are watching with interest what happened elsewhere and what impact that may have. It was funny, it was notable background, the Kingston of that. I remember I would see a [relative time] and I can recall walking myself virtually every ash con we had. And we have this long track record of exceedingly safe reliable operation of facilities. The personal there were just surprised to see anybody was interested in how those were being run. I think with the events at Duke, there will be more evaluation of our practice and closure practices and all sorts of things. I think this is something that is probably inevitable. The question to me to what degree and over what time frame. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Great, excellent. Thank you all very much. Tom Fanning :  Thank you. I appreciate you joining us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed. Tom Fanning :  Hello Ashar. Ashar Khan - Visium: Hi. How are you doing Tom? Tom Fanning : Great. Ashar Khan - Visium: Tom, I was trying to understand just trying to look through and I don't know if Art can help me on this. One thing which took a little people by surprise was when you came up with guidance in the January presentation you started off with 2.71 and then you subtracted $0.07, which was from dilution from the Kemper write-off 2014 and beyond. And you reset the base to $2.64. And then from there of course the growth came in for this year's EPS impact. With these write-offs, additional write-offs which have come in since the beginning of the year, should we then be modeling the similar kind, of course they are not to the extent that they happened last year, but should I be modeling something like for when you come out next year and all that, a slight decremented gain in the base EPS when if you were to go ahead and redo your EPS for next year, from this dilution impact from the write-offs and things like that, just wanted to get a little bit better understanding. Art Beattie :  Yeah, so pretty said lot here and we think is no, because we don\u2019t think we will require any new equity and therefore there is a not a diluted impact we will be able to manage this we think. Ashar Khan - Visium: Okay. Thank you so much. Tom Fanning : Thank you. We appreciate you join us. Operator :  And I am showing no further questions. Tom Fanning : Well listen. Thank you all for joining us today. I know it\u2019s a busy day for everybody. A lot of exciting things going on. I am really gratified, I don\u2019t like the fact that we had to write-off on Kemper again and change the schedule. But I am gratified with the sustaining excellence of the company, when you think about all the good work we had, I know we talk about that a lot last year, we really accomplish a whole lot in 2013 and I think our first quarter in \u201814 is a demonstration of that benefit. We thank you for joining us today. We thank you for follow Southern Company. We look forward to chatting with you further. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

My name is Tommy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome to everyone to the Southern Company\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remark, there will be question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And also as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir. Dan Tucker : Thank you, Tommy. Welcome everyone to Southern Company\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides of this conference call. To follow along during the call you can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As you know, 2013 was one of our busiest ever from a regulatory standpoint. The constructive results our traditional operating companies achieved has our company well-positioned to execute our plan to continue delivering on our core commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to customers and communities that we are privileged to serve. Our second quarter results were consistent with expectation. Weather was normal for first time in the past few quarters and the regional economies is gaining strength as anticipated. We achieved major milestones in our two major construction projects and continue to expand our track record of solid operational performance. In a few minutes, I will provide an update on our financial results, as well as our sales and economic outlook. But first, I\u2019d like to begin with an update on the constructions activities at Plant Vogtle and Kemper County. We continue to make impressive progress at Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 as you can see from the recent aerial photo we have included in our slide deck. Our next major milestone will be completion of the CA05 module for Unit 3, which will comprise one of the major wall sections with the containment vessel. That module is now outside of the module assembly building and it\u2019s projected to be installed in September. The next key element for Unit 3 will be CA01, a large containment vessel module that will have the Unit steam generators and a series of concrete pours that will raise the structural concrete currently surrounding the containment vessel bottom-head and bring it to ground-level, typically referred to as elevation 100. This concrete will ultimately serve as the foundation for the Unit 3 shield building. We currently have 36 of the 47 sub-modules for CA01 on-site and expect to install the completed module in late fourth quarter this year or first quarter next year. The concrete pours to elevation 100 should be finish near year end 2014. Meanwhile, the latest Vogtle construction monitoring or VCM hearing are complete with a vote scheduled for August 19th. During the hearing, the commission independent construction monitor concur that project risk are consistent with those contemplated when the project was approved and that they are being managed well by Georgia Power. The construction monitor also concur that -- sufficient oversight is being provided to contractors and global supply chain vendors. It was further noted, that Georgia Power has been successful in meeting requirements to secure the benefits of the DOE loan, production tax credits and other option to help mitigate risk for customers. We anticipate the filing of VCM 11 at the end of August. I am also happy to report that Plant Ratcliffe at Kemper County had a good quarter, in which Mississippi Power achieved significant construction milestones. Pressure testing is complete on both gasifier train, a significant step towards the heat up of the first gasifier, which is targeted for late third quarter or early fourth quarter 2014. We also have achieved pipe-tight status, meaning that all piping more than 900,000 linear feet is installed, sealed and ready for testing. Successful combined cycle testing is winding down at Mississippi Power prepared to place this portion of the plant in service. On the regulatory front, Mississippi continues to engage constructively with the Mississippi Public Utilities Commission staff. There are a number of issues involved that we are working are to resolve. In the meantime, we remain optimistic about the outcome of these discussions. Elsewhere, I'm pleased to report that the acquisition of the Macho Springs Solar Facility by Southern Power and Turner Renewable Energy closed during the second quarter. This 50-megawatt facility, the largest solar project in New Mexico is now in commercial operation and can generate enough electricity to power more than 18,000 homes. Southern Power continuing to seek new solar and natural gas projects with long-term contract and creditworthy counterparties. I will now turn over the call to Art for a financial and economic overview. Art Beattie : Thanks, Tom. For the second quarter of 2014 we earned $0.68 per share, compared to $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.34 per share. For the six months ended June 30, 2014 we earned a $1.08 per share, compared with $0.43 per share for the same period in 2013, an increase of $0.65 per share. Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2014 included an after-tax charge of $235 million or $0.26 per share, related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Earnings for the three and six months ended June 2013 included after-tax charges of $278 million or $0.32 per share and $611 million or $0.70 per share, respectively, related to the Kemper County project. Earnings for the first six months of 2013 also include an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding these items, earnings for the second quarter of 2014 were $0.68 per share, compared with $0.66 per share for the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.02 per share. Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2014, excluding these items were a $1.34 per share, compared with a $1.15 per share for the same period in 2013, an increase of $0.19 per share. A primary driver for our 2014 second quarter results was more normal weather compared to the same period in 2013, resulting in an increase of $0.03 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Second quarter 2014 earnings also benefited from increased industrial sales and retail revenue effects at our traditional operating company, earnings were offset somewhat by increases in non-fuel O&M expense. A more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in the slide deck. Economic activity in our region continues to be led by the industrial sector, as evidenced by our 13 consecutive months of year-over-year industrial sales growth. This growth is consistent with national trend such as the ISM Manufacturing Index, which has remained above 50, signaling expansion for the past 13 months. In our region we continue to see exports play a big role. In the second quarter of 2014 exports from Alabama and Georgia grew at 4.1%, almost twice the rate of the U.S. as a whole. Container exports from the Port of Savannah grew 6.3% in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 2.5% for all of 2013. This growth has been broad-based across all of our traditional operating companies and across all of our top 10 industrial segments. As an additional point of interest, 90% of our major customers say that they expect their sales for the second half of 2014 to be either the same or better than the first half of 2014. In the housing margin we continue to see signs of a slow recovery. The most recent Atlanta Federal Reserve survey of brokers and builders indicates that home sales are up from last year. Inventory levels continue to fall and prices continue to increase albeit modestly. Overall, builders and brokers expect activity in the Southeast to continue to increase. These trends are consistent with our internal measure of new housing activity, new connects, which were up 17% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same period last year, with positive growth across all of our traditional operating company. These findings which are consistent with our expectations for the period were underscored at the most recent meeting of our economic roundtable earlier this month. As a reminder, this is a group of regional economist and executives from a handful of our largest customers. Overall, the economic roundtable affirmed our view that of the continuing momentum behind the industrial sector and the continued recovery of the residential sector. The group's consensus is that GDP during the first quarter of 2014 was not consistent with employment or industrial production trends and that quarter-over-quarter GDP growth of 3% can be expected for the remainder of this year. Several of the economist on the roundtable noted that income growth continues to be weak and will likely remain so until underemployed workers are absorbed. This weakness in income growth is reflected in Southern Company's continued weakness in use per customer growth, as well as a signs of continued discipline on consumer spending patterns. All of this data is reflected in Southern Company\u2019s sales results, industrial sales were up 3% in the second quarter of 2004, compared with the second quarter of 2013, with all 10 of our top sectors demonstrating growth. For example, chemicals were up 5%, paper was up 6% and transportation was up 7%. As a group, the housing related segments of textiles, stone clay and glass, and lumber were all up 3%. Meanwhile, weather normal residential sales were down 0.6% and weather normal commercial sales were flat in the second quarter of 2014, compared to the second quarter of 2013. Looking forward, we continue to see this ongoing recovery reflected in strong economic development activity. One example of this is the Elba Island LNG Terminal where a joint partnership of Shell Oil and Southern LNG, a Kinder Morgan Company is adding natural gas export capability at its existing facility in Savannah. Once fully operational, the associated electrical load increase will be 180-megawatt making it one of the largest customers in our service territory. Meanwhile, in Alabama we continue to see growth among Tier 1 and Tier 2 auto suppliers for assembly plants we serve, as well as inquiries for suppliers that will serve the future Airbus assembly facility. Our economic development pipeline remains robust. We are currently tracking some 330 prospective projects, representing 37,000 new jobs and $14 billion in capital expenditures. From this pipeline more than 8,000 jobs were announced during the second quarter of 2014, a 23% increase over the same period in 2013, with the potential for $1.3 billion in capital expenditures. Now I'd like to share our earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2014, which will be $1.06 per share. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Art. As I've said many times before, Southern Company values the opportunity to engage constructively at all levels of government for the benefit of the customers we serve. This week we had another such opportunity in the formal public hearing on the EPA proposed rule for greenhouse gas emissions at existing power plant. Several of our company senior officers participated in the hearing yesterday and today both in the nation\u2019s capital and here at Atlanta. We continue to have concerns about the impact of this proposal, particularly with regard to the reliability and affordability of our nation's energy supply. We are currently reviewing the proposed rule and will submit our formal comments to the EPA in keeping with the established timeline. Our initial review, however, has revealed three primary reasons, why we believe the current proposed rule should be amended. First, the proposed rule significantly overreaches the EPA's authority by attempting to regulate activities that are clearly beyond the scope of the Clean Air Act and other existing legislation, and that have historically been under the purview of the states. Second, the detail of the proposed standard do not appear to be workable, relying upon unrealistic standard of performance and violating long standing regulatory construct. And third and perhaps most importantly, the proposal is not in the best interest of electric consumers due it potential negative impact on retail prices and system reliability. As we have in the past we will continue to engage constructively on all fronts in this important policy debate. We are now ready to take your questions. So, Operator, we'll now take the first question. Operator : Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) And we will proceed with our first question from the line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey, Greg Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I apologize if you answered any in the beginning, because I was a little bit late. I saw that things were looking up at Kemper this quarter you didn't have any further cost escalation beyond your current budget? As we get into the list of activities on the bottom right of page six, at what point over the course of the year should, if you are going to have further slippage, should we be focus -- what are the key things we should be focused on and when will they be incurring? Tom Fanning : So, yeah, we actually talked about this slide, getting ready for the call, year around our 95% of the way through construction. There will be tales of construction, when we say construction is complete there will be tales of construction that go right into just about in service. So saying its complete is kind of a term of our, but we\u2019re very close to kind of being there in a substantive way. The real risk, I think, going forward relate to start-up and of course, there are the normal issues related to start-up. But the one think we always say to ourselves is the unknown, unknown and that is, there could be as we go though the start-up process, potential equipment failure that we don\u2019t contemplate or have quick inventory or quick turnaround solution for that could impact schedule. But with respect to the risk associate with construction, those are winding down pretty quickly. The risks that largely remain in front of us are the risk that relate to start-up. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Okay. Second question, which is more of a tactical or short-term question just because we've had such a huge build in gas production, natural gas production and we've had a decline in the amount of gas being burned for power gen nationwide and so natural gas prices, partly because of weather, obviously, natural gas prices have fallen a lot? As you look at the rest of the summer, how do you see your gas burn relative to what you burned last year, because if I look at the very short-term data, I noticed that, it's gotten cooler down there over the last few days but you are still burning off a lot of gas relative to where you would be burning it, where the weather was, let's say, a month ago or two months ago? Is there something going on where we should expect a higher gas burn for the balance of the summer or should we assume that if the weather continues to be cool, that you will back down on the gas? Tom Fanning : Well, so, Greg, I think you are all over the question, right. We do steadfast economic dispatch, so whatever the cheapest energy is local provide and whatever energy resource provide the cheapest energy as what we will use. Look a year ago when gas prices were moderately higher and you had coal prices moderately cheaper, I am sorry, just the opposite, gas prices were cheaper, we burnt a lot more natural gas than we did coal. What we are seeing in this year is similar to what we projected and that is kind of in the 40% range for both coal and gas from an energy standpoint. We are slightly ahead so far in \u201814 on coal relative to gas. But I would argue with gas dropping down here recently right in the $4 range that gas will pick up a little bit. So my sense is kind of going forward is kind of where we thought we would be in the general range of 40-40 for both coal and gas. I can you specific number but I\u2019m not sure the differences are meaningful. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Okay. Thank you very much. Tom Fanning :  You bet. Operator :  Thank you. And we will go to our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Tom Fanning : Hey, Dan. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Hey. Tom, can you just give a little your clarification as, the headlines hit on kind of the discovery process of new nuclear. Can you just maybe explain more broadly how you were thinking about that? Tom Fanning : Sure. Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. It was funny how that got reported. It\u2019s actually on the YouTube website. I gave a speech, I think, I was keynoting at the Bipartisan Policy Center along with Energy Secretary, Ernest Moniz, and with all that energy innovation and after the talk was given, I had a few questions-and-answers. And I think this was the first question and it really went to, why isn\u2019t anybody else building nuclear and I went on to describe kind of what kind of companies could build new nuclear and what kind of had to be in place and I referred to different energy markets in the United States and at the very end of the comment, I said, something like, and what, I would love to be in position by the end of the year to announce that we are building that was starting even more nuclear. In doing that, everybody should know, that the way you start the process is the way we start the process at Vogtle 3 and 4, and that is you would begin a permitting process. Remember too that from kind of beginning to end is 10 years or so. So we are really talking about nuclear generation that could be in service in the middle of next decade and the first process that you start is the permitting process, where we would only do that as we did with Vogtle 3 and 4 with concurrence of our state regulatory jurisdiction, whichever one was relevant at that time. That I was talking it and what that does is preserves the option to build a nuclear if in fact that looks like it desirable from a customer standpoint in the future. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Tom, with the carbon rule sitting out there or with the review going on, what do you think is going to be the legal course as you guys look at the rule if it stays roughly as written in the final decision and do you guys think there is a potential for a stay or is that too big of an ask? Tom Fanning : That's a fascinating question, Dan. The overreach here to me is so clear and it\u2019s interesting. The EPA says we are giving everybody flexibility. They can\u2019t give you what is not there to give. The inference must be the somehow Congress via the Clean Air Act gave EPA more power over the electric utility industry and new power over relatively what has been the purview of the state than even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In other words, somehow EPA is taking the authority to require in some respect renewable portfolio of standard, state energy efficiency standards, they are taking the power to obviate what has been the long standing practice of economic dispatch and incorporate a concept of environmental dispatch and in the course raise prices significantly and perhaps, reduce reliability. My sense is this overreach is so great. I think there is, number one, a significant opportunity to amend the rule before it becomes final, and number two, to work in whatever jurisdiction is sensible to achieve a better structure or better timeframe in which to evaluate it. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Will determination on a final rule have bearing on the potential construction of additional nuclear division -- nuclear, so you\u2026 Tom Fanning : Sure. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : \u2026 would starting this process now facilitate more? Tom Fanning : Yeah. In other words, but, there is also some unintended consequences, the nuclear rule is written really doesn't it actually helps to penalize, people have taken early action. Since 2005 Southern Company has reduced our carbon emissions 26%. We\u2019ve led the United States in the renaissance of new nuclear and essentially we don't get on to getting credit for those actions. And even in the plant, even if you haven\u2019t started, if you\u2019ve contemplated plant, they would include those in the calculation and you don't get credit for that. Now, having said all that, any passage of further regulation around greenhouse gases does incent new nuclear, that is clear. And in fact, building new nuclear is in our view has been a hedge against future carbon regulation. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you guys. Tom Fanning : Eggers, thank you. Operator : Now, we\u2019ll go to our next question. It is from the line of Steven Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey Steve. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Hey Tom. How are you? Tom Fanning : Good. How are you doing? Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : I\u2019m doing great. So, first, I guess just to clarify the clarification of the nuclear -- the new nuclear, excuse me. So, is this -- are you at a point, when you are doing kind of your RFP process or other stuff, where you need to be making decisions on the next round of baseload and, thus, looking at permitting nuclear or something else over the next 12 months or 24 months or no? Tom Fanning : There is nothing new in the statement that we haven\u2019t said numerous times already. We believe nuclear is a dominant solution in the portfolio of Southern Company generation going forward. When all things considered, we need baseload, you need baseload intermediate peaking. We know that coal is kind of moving away from favor in America. So to the extent, you\u2019re going to do coal. It looks like a Kemper plant. If you\u2019re not going to do coal, it\u2019s nuclear. And so if you\u2019re going to preserve nuclear as an option to add as a baseload resource in the middle of the next decade, you need to start thinking about the steps necessary to preserve that option, that\u2019s all I was referring to. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay. And then switching gears, I think Georgia was going to do a pretty large solar RFP. Is there any update on that process? Art Beattie : Yes, Steve, they have that process ongoing. There were bids that were made. I think it was late April. There will be a short-list notification sometime in the middle of August and then a final -- the final selection, I guess, would be mid October of this year. And we\u2019ll know by then, I guess, whether Southern Power or Georgia Power will be either in the short-list or the final list by the October call. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay, great. And then I guess, one last question, I guess for Tom. Just -- we started seeing some more utility M&A activity recently in the sector. Could you maybe just give us an update in your thinking on consolidation in the sector, and how Southern might or might not participate in that? Tom Fanning : Well, here again, this is going to be a standard answer, Steve. We are not going to comment on any specific transaction, of course. And of course, it is standard for management to exercise its fiduciary responsibility to evaluate option enhancing -- the value enhancing strategy for its shareholders to the extent, any of those opportunities come to fore, of course, we\u2019ll pursue it and if successful, announce it. But it\u2019s something we do all the time. We look all the time. And our position is we\u2019re reasonably conservative from a financial standpoint. We believe in maintaining the highest level of financial integrity. I know one of the invoke idea is these day is to use cash. I think the underlying presumption there is to use debt at least as a bridge underlying the cash. But I really don't have anything new to add that I haven\u2019t said before. We\u2019ll look at it all the time. You look extraordinarily hard to complete successfully that really do accrete to shareholder value. But that doesn't mean we won't be trying. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay, great. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Operator : Thank you very much. We\u2019ll go to our next question. It is from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies LLC. Go ahead. Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon, Jeff. How are you? Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Just hopefully a quick question on the Southern Power project. I\u2019m just wondering, what type of returns are you seeing on solar now? And I think, with the advent of YieldCos and all these other type entities, has there been like a downward pressure on the returns you are getting from renewables? Art Beattie : Well, we continue to look at that, Anthony. We\u2019ve got a process whereby we evaluate every deal on its own. There is not a one-size fits all approach here. We look at the terms and conditions around whatever they maybe, the offtaker, where the project is located, whether there is any other legal risk associated with the contracts within the states that we\u2019re looking at. And we\u2019ll adjust our hurdle rates based on those. But I\u2019m not going to comment on any kind of return number that we look at because it varies honestly with every project we did. Tom Fanning : It\u2019s reasonably consistent, I think. We haven\u2019t changed our hurdle rates as we expect kind of what the market is showing us. I haven\u2019t seen a dramatic change of what yield curves are offering in the market. Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you guys. Tom Fanning : Yeah, bet. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question. It is from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey Mark. Mark Barnett - Morningstar: Hey, good afternoon everybody. How are you doing? Tom Fanning : Great. Mark Barnett - Morningstar: This is going to be a tough question, but I know you can't really comment on the details. But I guess, maybe the larger items that we should really be focused on when we see the outcome of the Mississippi prudency process there. And can you maybe walk us through how that's going to -- how it will be announced and what to look for? Tom Fanning : So we alluded to it in the opening comments and it really kind of go to the idea of global settlement. There is a whole host of the issues that could be taken into account in what we describe as our ongoing constructed dialog with this type of questions. I know you all will say about where are you in that. And I think the best thing for us to say right now is to let the people do their work and when we have something to announce, we\u2019ll announce it, to not say too much at this point. Mark Barnett - Morningstar: Good. Tom Fanning : We remain optimistic about our result. Mark Barnett - Morningstar: Okay, okay. I guess the most likely outcome, like you mentioned is maybe more of a settlement between the related -- the parties involved. Tom Fanning : Well, sure. We are then working on our -- so called global settlement that takes into account a number of issues and we think we\u2019re having constructive dialog about that issue. Mark Barnett - Morningstar: Okay. Thanks. I know that's pretty hard to talk about at this point. Just a quick question on operations. It's a smaller item, but kind of an ongoing trend from the last quarter. You have a pretty major shift in your non-Powder River burn away from the Powder River Basin. Is this just a function of where your contracts and pricing are at or is there something else moving that needle? Art Beattie : I think that\u2019s a function of outages. We had some of our Powder River units. Operator : Thank you very much. We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Paul Rizdon with KeyBank. Go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello, Paul. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Just any updates on the Vogtle dispute? Tom Fanning : No. We have all engaged in conversations. There is kind of two ways to think about that. And I would direct you to go to their earnings call as well. But there is the nature of the conversation between Georgia Power and the Consortium. Recall the Consortium is Toshiba, Westinghouse, Chicago Bridge & Iron. And then there is a conversation within the consortium among and between Westinghouse, Chicago Bridge & Iron, and Toshiba. In effect, what I\u2019m saying is both of those have to be resolved in order for us to reach the settlement. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Any venture, I guess, as to the timeline until settlement? Tom Fanning : No, I have said this before and I don\u2019t mean to sound glib. It\u2019s something that could happen quickly or something that could take a long time including going to litigation. Recall, venue is Augusta, Georgia. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: And then just back to the new, new nuclear, so anyone who is expecting an announcement out of Southern by year-end took your comments out of context? Tom Fanning : Sure. Look that\u2019s something we said consistently. I was kind of surprised at the amount of press it got. Love to be in a position by the end of the year to announce and what you do when you start that process is you undertake essentially a permitting process. And we would only do that with the approval of the relevant jurisdiction in order to recover those costs. Recall also that\u2019s not a commitment to build, that\u2019s a commitment to gain the option to build. So this is something that will -- these are first steps you take in order to achieve new generation by the middle of the next decade, for heaven\u2019s sake, something like that. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Okay. Thanks again. Tom Fanning : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll go to our next question from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hi Ali. How are you? Ali Agha - SunTrust: Good. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One, Tom or Art, can you remind us in your \u201814 numbers, what weather-normalized electric sales have you assumed for the year? And how are you looking at them on a longer-term basis? Can you just remind us of those numbers? Art Beattie : Yeah. On the -- if we look at \u201814, total retail sales, we expect it to be up 0.7% over 2013 level. And then beyond that, it really is around 1% to maybe a little stronger than that. That\u2019s a function of how fast the economy grows in the \u201815, \u201816 timeframe. Ali Agha - SunTrust: And year-to-date? Art Beattie : Year-to-date we are standing at 1.1%. Ali Agha - SunTrust: All right. And I know third quarter obviously is the biggest, but given the trends you are seeing, would that cause you to change your full-year outlook at this point? Art Beattie : No, we don\u2019t comment on that until third quarter. Tom Fanning : Yeah. And just to remind everybody, we only talk about guidance twice in a year. Once when we give it and once when we kind of update it in October. Ali Agha - SunTrust: Okay. Separately, Art, I know last time, I think it was in the last earnings call, you had mentioned with regards to equity, needs for equity that you were pretty much close to your limit in staying out of the equity issuance side. Are we still there or can you just give us an update on your latest thoughts regarding equity needs perhaps in the future? Art Beattie : Yeah. Ali, what we talked about is issuing about $600 million of new equity this year. And through June, we\u2019ve issued $331 million. So we\u2019re well on track to hit our target. And our target hasn\u2019t changed. Ali Agha - SunTrust: Okay. And last question, Tom, for you. Again, you all have given us an update longer-term, talking about your earnings trajectory, slight slowdown next couple of years and then a pickup again down the road. Are you seeing opportunities that could change that trajectory and cause the near-term growth to go up as well or is that still the profile we should be looking at for the next five years or so? Tom Fanning : That\u2019s still the profile. You know that we\u2019re a conservative company and so we wanted to give you kind of -- we've never really gone out that far talking about what our earnings trajectory might be. And the reason we did that because we felt it had a shape. And so we wanted to describe the shape to you all. We continue to work hard on late to improve that shape. We have several things that we\u2019re kicking around internally here, opportunities with Southern Power, opportunities around the traditional business. But not that we want to give the weight that would be derived from conversation in this form, still kicking around a lot of stuff. Ali Agha - SunTrust: Got it. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. And we\u2019ll go to our next question. It is from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Association. Go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey Paul. Paul? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association : Hi. How are you doing? Sorry about that? Tom Fanning : Sure. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association : Hi, how are you doing? Sorry about that. A lot of my questions have been answered, but just to sort of fall back on Kemper. If I understood your comments earlier, it sounds like you guys pretty much feel that the boundaries are laid out in such a way that there probably isn't going to be much more of a cost increase potential there. Is that -- am I understanding that correctly? Tom Fanning : So I am looking at all those risks. If I were to focus more on startup risks, what would the risk be and I used the funny phrase, unknown, unknown, right. So let\u2019s say as we go through startup, some piece of equipments failed that we didn\u2019t anticipate. We tried to mitigate or at lease be proactive in mitigating startup risks by providing I think extra man of inventory of we think -- what we think are critical parts to the plant. But in startup if something does not perform well or needs to be redesigned or whatever, that could add more months to the schedule for example and that would require increased cost. Right now we have reserves through I guess the very end of May, June for us whatever you to call it. So we maintained that estimate. Obviously if we didn\u2019t have comments to that estimate we would have changed it. We had a good quarter in construction and I think being pipe-tight. So that means essentially all the pipe is erected. Now we still need to test it and other things. We just had a good quarter and I want to make sure that\u2019s been on the site there. They are just working like crazy. Understand that we appreciate their effectiveness this quarter. The challenge now transitions I think largely become a structure project to a start project. That will have its own set of issues we will see. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association : Okay. I did notice that the first fire of gasifier A's schedules have been pushed out. Would that be a key thing to look for in September or October as being one of key test? Tom Fanning : That\u2019s right, Paul. I mean to the extent you can\u2019t made that kind of schedule that puts pressure on the back end, we move the schedule in concert with the new estimated, new member when we came up with the May schedule. So we changed a lot of the major components along that way. So that schedule is consistent with the completion date at the end of May. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association : Okay. And then I think Steve was asking about M&A. And I remember previously that you guys had a preference for the super Southeast. And I was sort of wondering just geographically, does that -- I'm not sure exactly what that means. Does that include Texas? Or is that still something that you guys have a preference for the Southeast versus other areas? Tom Fanning : Let me speak very broadly about that. The preference in something like a super Southeast would be where you could gain natural synergies. That\u2019s what that comment alludes to, okay. So let me just pick stuff out of the air. We would have more synergies operationally in a company that was inside our footprint or adjacent to it or whatever. Then, we would for a company in Canada. That\u2019s really the concept you are after there. So in preferring the super Southeast, it is the idea that you can more readily gain operational synergies and let me also distinguish between asset M&A where you don\u2019t really require synergy so much. That\u2019s like building a solar plant in New Mexico relative to corporate M&A which is I think what you are referring to. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association : Okay. I got the picture. Thanks so much. Tom Fanning : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we will go to our next question. It\u2019s from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael, how are you Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : I am all right, Tom. Thanks for taking my questions. Really a near-term one, and this may be more of an Art one. Third quarter guidance, if I back out all the one-time items from third quarter of last year is flat to actually down a little bit? How should we think about the puts and takes, not really just for third quarter, but also for fourth quarter -- meaning, kind of what's weighing on third quarter? Why isn't there a little growth year-over-year, of third quarter of 2013 to third quarter of 2014? And what does that mean or imply for fourth quarter? Is it an O&M timing issue? Is it a view on kind of the summer? Just trying to ask some of the near-term puts and takes. Tom Fanning : Yeah, O&M is certainly an aspect that if you look at our history, we are second half spending company. And depending on actually how the third quarter goes because the third quarter represents fully 45% of our annual earnings, it\u2019s a big player and that points directly at four quarter earnings over the last five years. We have earned anywhere from $0.18 and $20.10 to 0.48 last year and that\u2019s a reflection of where we end up through the third quarter. We also have weather impacts as well as you know and we\u2019re assuming normal weather throughout the remainder of the year, but that\u2019s certainly something we have to plan into account for. The other aspect is the share count and share counts are up. We talked about issuing new shares this year. So you got to weigh that into and once you factor all of that net, these are all the things that are as you say puts and takes on where the number went up. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Got it. And when we think about just the next year, year and a half, maybe year or so, what's next on the horizon going across the Southern system in terms of just thinking about rate filings, rate actions, that could involve not just pretty small numbers, but where there is stuff on the horizon that folks should pay a lot of attention to? Art Beattie : Michael, this is Art. Georgia completed their rate case last year, right. So they are good through 2016 from a new rate filing perspective. And when you look at Gulf, Gulf power miss a -- well they filed the rate case last year that was settled. They are going through 2016 as well. Alabama as you know has filings every year and there will file hat something in the fall so you would need to look at their as to what particular filing would have. There are also clauses at some of our operating companies that could operate as well. Alabama being one of those. You also have fuel issues at each of our operating companies .Right now systems wide we are 283 million underrecovered on fuel and some of our companies have had to file with their regulatory bodies just as information not necessarily for a change in rate, but some of them maybe dealt, with some of them maybe pushed out. And then Mississippi I believe is good through 2025-$016 as well from their PEP filings. So it varies but o think to a large degree al of those are pretty well settled. Alabama be in the annual filing that you would have to each year. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : And in Alabama, you would attempt to recover the deferral that you made in the prior RSE process? Tom Fanning : Yeah, of the O&M deferral that what you were referring? Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Yes. Tom Fanning : That\u2019s correct. And that\u2019s over another period of time I think over 3 years. Any of that is always part of the calculus. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Yes, got me. And then last item, just thoughts on bonus depreciation. It\u2019s kind of been bantered around back and forth a little bit in DC. Just curious in terms of, A, what the impact would be on cash -- I don't know, needs and uses for next year, a little bit, if it gets extended? And, B, just the general -- from a policy, and from an impact on Southern's spending level, how you think about it in the broader energy policy framework. Tom Fanning : Well, Michel has already in. At 2014 we are looking at anywhere 200 to 225, but when you look at 2015, it\u2019s would certain impact some of our assets and it will impact some of our match compliance. So I don\u2019t have a number to share with you, but it could dramatically impact the financing that we do from a cash flow perspective. The other side of that sword is the fact that it reduces rate based growth. So they are good and bad associated with bonus depreciation. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Videla Marti with CDP Capital. Go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello, Videla. Videla Marti - CDP Capital : Good afternoon, how are you? Tom Fanning : Great. Videla Marti - CDP Capital : I have got two questions kind of first one is much more industry type of thing versus you guys specifically. Is there a lot of press recently about couple of years ago, there was a huge solar flare that came off with close to threatening our entire grid and doing that and historical even back in the 1859 that knocked out all the telegraphs and things of that nature. So I am just kind of wondering one kind of what yourselves and industry are doing to possibly prepared for that type of event that just like kind of tail end kind of things. And that is also tied into the cyber issues. Well, so if you can just kind of talk a little bit about obviously given your position in the industry, you have to sure you guys are extremely involved in all this, just like to get a sense of that and I\u2019ve got separate secondary separate question. Tom Fanning : Yeah, so we are involved. I chair for the industry and that\u2019s not IOUs, that includes co-ops and municipal utilities, it\u2019s called the ESCC, the Electricity Sector Coordinating council. You may know that under the Department of Homeland & Security they have cut commerce in the United States, they segmented it into 16 pieces if you will. And so our sector is one of the 16 so I chair that electricity sector coordination council. And we are responsible essentially for proactive planning and adaptive responses to all things cyber, physical terrorism and natural disasters. And some of the things you suggest are absolutely part of our purview and there is quite a bit of activity going on. And in fact the government I think you can look this up. They government has held the electricity sector up as -- I think the best sector in terms of preparedness and response to different threats. Lot of different things we could go into here. You know that we have been involved in response to the kind of request for additional physical security updates. So this kind of interrogatories back and forth between NERC. The cyber issue you may know that we have adopted a single kind of cyber threat regime, a set of software that\u2019s kind of under the offices of the government which we will be able to detect anamolies within electronic commerce, servers other things. Access those anamolies and then be able to piece together information around the potential for threats and the best way to either protect or respond to a current threat. All of that is going on right now and I would say on the third sector this response of natural disaster CEO of AEP great friend of mine, great guys have been leading an effort in the industry to meet together a more effective response from what they call RMAX regional mutual assistance groups. We actually I thin performed well with Hurricane Sandy, but I think even now we will perform better and I think we are much better suited from a comprehensive storm to be able to respond great. So I would be glad to fill it up, with a lot more details, but that\u2019s the quick flyby. The ESCC govern cyber terrorism, physical terrorism, natural disasters. We work hand in glove with the department of homeland security through the department of energy. We have I think unique among all the other industries deep CEO participation. This is nothing that delegated down. And I think we've already demonstrated, I think really good plan and responsive to threat. Videla Marti - CDP Capital : How much is this costing a year or cumulatively over a period of time in order to address all these possibilities? Tom Fanning : Videla, that changes based on each company. Each company is going to have a different kind of response to that question. So if you have somebody in mind, it\u2019s much better for you to ask them than me. Let me just give you the aggregate answer. The amount of money that we\u2019re talking about pale in comparison to the benefit. As an industry, we have always been committed to providing the best reliability and we understand that the United States is in a new era. And we all understand that not only responding to but being proactive to defend ourselves against these threats is job one for us. So, yes, it\u2019s going to require some more money, but I think the cost pales in comparison to the benefit. Videla Marti - CDP Capital : Okay. And I guess one last thing going back to the old M&A question couple of times. I mean, in my career, last time you guys ever did a corporate-on-corporate was when I first showed up in 1987 when you guys bought savanna. And I'm just wondering given the state of the industry, I mean other than finding something discrete. Is there anything that is within -- what\u2019s going on in the industry that makes your attention or interest in M&A any higher than what it\u2019s ever being in the past? Tom Fanning : That\u2019s a very interesting question. My quick answer is probably not, not really. I think we are where we have been. We've always been very consistent in our love of the integrated regulated utility model. We always think that we generate the best long-term value for shareholders by providing the best risk-adjusted returns around. We think that our jurisdiction have demonstrated that we can deliver attractive returns with low-risk profiles and therefore from an EVA sense deliver I think a terrific value proposition. For us to undertake M&A activity we have to be convinced in the long run that we can preserve that kind of performance. That\u2019s just a big challenge. When you look around, the expression also don't chase fads. A lot of companies will pursue things in the short run. We really are focused on the long run. So we don't get kind of dazzled by short-term trends, we tried to keep our eye on the right long star here. Videla Marti - CDP Capital : Appreciate. Thank you, Tom. Tom Fanning : Yes. Operator : Thank you very much. And we get our next question from line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hi, Andy. How are you? Andy Levi - Avon Capital : Yeah. I\u2019m good. Thank you. And I thought that was a very good question on last one, we are last. And I apologize ahead of time for asking this question, but I feel the question is need to be ask because I just had a notice it\u2019s coming up in one of the companies that your doing businesses. So, if you look at kind of CBI and its stock price has dropped from 85 to 60. And I am by no mean an accounting expert or an expert in CBI, but obviously this is the financial issues that were brought up whether they are true or not. But I just want to know how kind of that affects your thinking and whether it\u2019s affected any of the construction or are there any concerns that Southern has relative to CBI. Tom Fanning : Yeah. And Andy, thank you for the question. You all know this we\u2019re completely transparent, we love question. Anything you want to ask is fully fair game, so never apologize. The second thing is we think CBI is a great partner in this project. We think the performance frankly off the project. The challenges have been redo some states comment. And I meet periodically with Philip Asherman, their CEO back. In fact, Buzz Miller and will flew to Houston two weeks ago to meet with them. Just go eye to eye on certain issues. We do that all the time. And frankly, I think this week we\u2019re meeting with Westinghouse and Toshiba personnel and DC. So, this is something that we do as an ongoing matter. This is not constructing plant Vogtle 3 and 4, in many respects, it\u2019s not a delegated activity. But Buzz Miller certainly does a great job, but we\u2019re all involved. With respect of any challenges that CBI had recently that have been in the press look the right people that I ask about that is CBI. We can't speak for them at all and we do look at their earnings call and at least from our position in terms of the interrelationship, we have on plant Vogtle 3 and 4. We think they have fully explained that to the investment community and we are very satisfied with their relationship in the consumer channel and their relationship to us. Andy Levi - Avon Capital : Great. Thank you very much for answering that. Tom Fanning : You better. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll get our next question from the line of Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Got it ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello there. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi. Good afternoon. I have a couple questions on your slides on Vogtle, Kemper, and then some on related to your sales. And excuse me if these are repeats, but I kind of missed the beginning. I had some issues with calling in. But I just wanted to try to get a sense on slide 4, how we should think about the timing? The things you have listed as near-term and on the horizon are those things that will occur in the third quarter, or how should we think about the timing of those items that you have classified there? Art Beattie : Yeah. Dan, this is Art. CA05, I think we get dressed in the script that we talked about this morning and we\u2019re looking at like it was September. Before CA05, that what we did comment there was, is out of the module assembly building but it is a waiting. It\u2019s going under further modifications but it will be lifted sometime within the next month or two into the nuclear island. But setting the containment vessel lower ring, those are already complete and ready to go. They're going to probably do that after they insert CA05, so again, from a timing perspective, it sometime probably September. And then the cooling tower vertical construction, I guess on unit 3. I'm guessing Dan, and this is sometime in the next four months. But Dan, that really is not what we would call critical path. Critical path is all in the nuclear island. In terms of unit four, again module fabrication has just begun on their major module. The nuclear wall installation will continue and by the way we\u2019re making great progress on unit four. If you compare activities, we\u2019re learning a lot of lessons from our construction in unit 3 and applying them on unit 4. And then the turbine building vertical construction is certainly not critical path either on unit 4 but it is going very well and you'll see steel come up out of the ground, probably sometime late this year. Tom Fanning : Yeah. If I do that real quick, I would say and it just goes back. Dan, maybe you miss the reading on the script. CA05 September, CA01 late fourth quarter or early first quarter next year, Elevation 100 concrete pour near year end. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then on Kemper, I was wondering just I was looking, prior to the call, at your presentation I think you did back in June. And I just want to make sure I understand the terminology. You've mentioned first gasifier fire expected late third quarter or early fourth, where earlier it set first gasifier heat-up targeted for mid-to-late summer. So is heat-up and fire different, or are they the same or how should I think about that? Art Beattie : Hey Dan, those are the same. And it\u2019s moved out a bit again. It\u2019s getting ready, doing a lot of the milestones ahead of that, like airflow testing and making sure the lignite dryers work like they are designed to do. So there are test all along of the way with equipment that Tom describes earlier in the call. But the pressure test on Train A took a couple of three weeks or whatever the pressure on Train B went very quickly. So we\u2019re very gratified with our progress so far. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : I know the last quarter, I think you talked a little bit about how the timing of these in-service dates on Kemper have some implications for the tax credits and so forth, or the investment tax credits. And you have here first syngas production expected late this year. Would that be enough to qualify that for those credits this year, or not, if you were able to achieve that? Tom Fanning : Tax perspective, from a mix bonus depreciation perspective will be the combined cycle by putting it in service -- for bill. They push is bonus depreciation into 2015 as well. So we just have to wait. That probably wouldn\u2019t happen until later this year. But we really don't want to get into all the details of that because we don't want to front run the regulatory discussions going on. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then just the last question I had his kind of related to -- your industrial sales year-to-date have been up almost 3%, which is quite a bit stronger than, I think, your forecast. I wonder if you can give us a little more color just on\u2026 Art Beattie :  I\u2019ll catch you up. Yeah. It was broad based, you look at our top 10 industrial segments, all of them show growth most of the quarter and year-to-date period. Chemicals, our largest segment, was up 5.4% for the quarter. Primary metals are second largest was up 3.5%. So it\u2019s been very broad based and you think geographically it was across our entire footprint. All the operating companies participated in the growth and expansion on the industrial side. Tom Fanning : And your roundtable, economic roundtable seems to suggest that people were bullish about prospects going forward. So we expect it to continue. Art Beattie :  Yes, one other element that you may have missed, Dan, was that we also survey our top customers, about what their sales going to be over the next six months and 90% of the risk today through 2014. So that\u2019s a very bullish indicator to me that they\u2019re expecting similar sales of their products into the market. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay, and then the last thing just on the residential side, in terms of customer growth. Is the customer growth in line with what you expected, or how is that tracking? Tom Fanning : Yeah. It\u2019s going directly in line with what we expected. We\u2019ve added 13,300 residential customers since the end of last year. If you look at a year-over-year it's right at 25,000. So it is going directly in line with our expectations for the year. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you very much. And at this time, there are no further question. Sir, are there any closing remarks. Tom Fanning : Yeah. Just want to say thank you again for participating with us this afternoon. The team here is working hard to generate value by continuing the attractive returns that we\u2019re able to demonstrate and manage risk, especially in our major projects as we go forward. We appreciate your attendance and will be with you shortly as we hit the road as we always do. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Good day everyone.",

At this time, I would like to welcome to everyone to the Southern Company\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday October 29, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir. Dan Tucker :  Thanks Scott. And welcome everyone to Southern Company\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattiem, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides of this conference call. To follow along during the call you can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning.:  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. In a few minutes I will provide an update on our financial results as well as our sales and economic outlook. First I would like to begin with an update on construction activities at Kemper County and Plant Vogtle.  First, an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. Last night, we filed our latest 8-K and monthly PSC report for the project, which reflect a quarterly increase in cash comps of $418 million consistent with in-service date in the first half of 2016. As you recall the 8-K, we filed approximately one month ago reflected $88 million in increased non-schedule related cost and indicated that the schedule was likely to be extended into late 2015 pending a review by the project team.  Since that time, the project team has worked through their latest comp analysis and identified additional non-schedule related cost of $20 million for a total of $108 million. The remaining cost increases totaling $310 million can all be attributed to the extension of the schedule by 10 months. We currently estimate that each additional month will cost $20 million to $30 million and our increased forecast assumes the high-end of that estimate.  As a reminder major construction is essentially complete and the combined cycle portion of the plan has been in service since early August. Is then performing extremely well running at a capacity factor of 80% and has an Equivalent Forced Outage Rate or EFOR of less than 1%. That compared to an industry average for combined cycle of closer to 4%. With the combined cycle producing energy for customers, it\u2019s important to note that the schedule extension we have disclosed before the gasifier and gas cleanup systems of the facility.  These two complex systems are key long-term value drivers for customers as the ability to utilize Mississippi lignite along with the capture and sale of byproducts like CO2 are both key to delivering reliable low comp energy to customers for years to come. Within this long-term value in line the project team has recommended and we have agreed to adopt a more methodical approach to operator training, control system design, start up activity and integration of the gasifier and gas cleanup system.  I am proud that work that has been done in Kemper. There is a very clear distinction between the outstanding quality of work on site and our frustrating difficulties as far with accurately forecasting cost and schedule. We will continue to work diligently towards the successful completion of this project and once we get past start up integration, which no doubt will include many challenges, we expect that facility to benefit Mississippi power customers in a safe and reliable manner for decades to come.  Meanwhile, progress continues towards in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4. Our most recent major milestone was the setting of the CA05 module for Unit 3. This module provides structural support and also serves as a safety barrier within the containment vessel. The 50 foot tall lower ring of the containment vessel has also been set in Unit 3. While the critical path and with it most of the external focus has been on the Unit 3 nuclear island. The progress around the remainder of the side is noteworthy as well. For example, the units 3 cooling tower is now more than 500 feet tall with less than 100 feet remaining to build. We have also made significant progress on the unit 3 annex building which is critical for the initial energization and testing of the plant electrical components. Meanwhile, at the unit 4, the first concrete poured inside the containment vessel and we\u2019ve completed the foundation for the 500 kilowatt transmission switch yard that will serve the entire site. Upcoming near term milestone for unit 3 include the reaching of Elevation 100 in the nuclear island bringing the initial shield building module to ground level where they will serve as the foundation for the remainder of the shield building. We also expect to see unit 3 cooling tower completed before year end. The CA01 module, which is schedule to be placed during the first quarter of 2015 is the largest structural module to be placed in the nuclear island and we\u2019ll have the unit\u2019s steam generator. Unit 4 also has several upcoming milestones including structural module CA04 and CB65. Fabrication of CA20 modules for unit 4 is currently underway with on-site assembly expected to begin in the next few months. As you know, the latest Vogtle construction monitoring report was filed in late August. More recently, Georgia Power filed its direct testimony in support of the VCM11 filing. Hearings are scheduled to begin November 05th, with the commission voting next February. Obviously, a project of this magnitude comes with many challenges including among these is the ongoing pressure on the construction schedule which we believe is still achievable. We will continue to work through issues on a daily basis and are very pleased with how the project has proceeded thus far. Through the combination of diligent oversight and quality assurance effort, our fixed and firm EPC contract and the robust regulatory process, we believe we\u2019re well positioned for success with this project going forward.  I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Art, for a financial and economic overview. Art Beattie :  Thanks, Tom. For the third quarter of 2014, we earned $0.80 per share compared to $0.97 per share in the third quarter of 2013, a decrease of $0.17 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we earned $1.88 per share compared to $1.41 per share for the same period in 2013, an increase of $0.47 per share. Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 include after tax charges of $258 million or $0.29 per share and $493 million or $0.55 per share respectively related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power\u2019s Kemper County project. Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 include after tax charges of $93 million or $0.11 per share and $704 million or $0.81 per share respectively related to the Kemper County project. Earnings for the first nine months of 2013 also include an after tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding these items, earnings for the third quarter of 2014 were $1.09 per share compared with $1.08 per share for the third quarter of 2013 an increase of $0.01 per share. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 excluding these items were $2.43 per share compared with $2.24 per share for the same period in 2013 and increase of $0.19 per share. A primary driver for our 2014 third quarter results was more normal weather compared to the same period in 2013 resulting in an increase of $0.06 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Third quarter 2014 earnings also benefited from retail revenue effects at our traditional operating companies as well as increased industrial sales and residential customer growth. Revenue increases were largely offset by increases in non-fuel O&M expenses. A more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in this slide deck. Economic activity and sales growth in our region reflect a recovering economy and for the remainder of this year, we anticipate continued improvement with expected quarter-over-quarter GDP growth of 3% for both the third and fourth quarters of 2014. Despite recent volatility consumer confidence has improved more than 10 points since 2013.   Residential building permits are 11% higher for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 and initial unemployment claims are now close to prerecession level. Additionally, the monthly U.S. economic policy uncertainty index is trending toward prerecession level. In summary, the economy is recovering but still considered fragile and subject to event risk. This economic data is reflected in our sales results. Industrial sales were up nearly 5% in the third quarter of 2014 compared with the third quarter of 2013 with expansion across all major segments. For the first nine months of 2014, six of our top 10 industrial segments show sales above prerecession level while our housing related segments are recovering strongly but remained below their prerecession marks.  Segments with the strongest growth include primary medals up 12%, transportation up 7% and housing related segments of stone, clay and glass and lumber up 7% and 6% respectively. Expectations for continued strength in the industrial segment are upbeat. This supported by an expanding ISM manufacturing index which indicates increasing levels of employment production inventory new orders and supplier deliveries. Also our surveys of top industrial customers continue to indicate that a majority expect continuing strong product demand from their customers for the next six months.  Meanwhile, we have a normal residential and commercial sales remained relatively flat in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2013. Residential customer growth continues to recover with Southern Company reporting positive customer additions during the third quarter of 2014. But the first nine months of 2014, we have added more than 21,000 new residential customers about 4,000 more than expected. However, weak household income growth continues to challenge growth in customer usage. We continue to see evidence of strong economic development activity within our region. One recent example is the announcement of the new Army Cyber Command headquarters at Fort Gordon near Augusta Georgia. Consolidating U.S. Army cyber security functions for the first time and bringing nearly 4,000 jobs in East Georgia. And just this morning the Navy Federal Credit Union announced it will be adding 5,000 new jobs in Pensacola, Florida. These are in addition to the 2,000 new jobs announced in May of this year. The first 2,000 jobs will be in place by 2016 and the additional 5,000 are expected to be in place by the early 2020. Other economic development and announcements include a tractor manufacturing adding 650 jobs to an existing facility in Hall County Georgia. A carpet manufacturing facility expansion that will bring 350 jobs to Cartersville, Georgia and a new medical research and development facility bringing 300 jobs to Metro Atlanta. So overall, our economic development pipeline remains robust in on a positive long-term trajectory.  Now turning to our fourth quarter estimates; an EPS for 2014, our fourth quarter estimate is $0.37 per share this implies a year-end result of $2.80 per share excluding charges related to Kemper which is at the very top of our annual guidance range of $2.72 to $2.80 per share. Included in our fourth quarter estimate is the initial earnings impact of the Solar Gen 2 project recently announced by Southern Power. This transaction with first solar will increase the size of Southern Power\u2019s growing solar portfolio by almost 30%.  The 150 megawatt project, which will be 51% owned by Southern Power and used to serve a 25-year purchase power agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric is expected to be completed in December of this year. In addition to the Solar Gen 2 project, Southern Power also completed a transaction to purchase 90% of the 50 megawatt Macho spring solar facility in New Mexico earlier this year. And recently purchased options to acquire development rights to approximately 100 megawatt of utility scale projects associated with Georgia Power Advanced Solar initiative. As you know we previously provided a forecast of placeholder CapEx for Southern Power of $1.4 billion over the three year period 2014 to 2016. With the projects we have either already completed or for which we have options to purchase, we have already utilized about $1 billion of that estimate. Given our recent successes in the solar power market and the availability of additional projects, we will reassess our placeholder forecast for Southern Power in conjunction with our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call in February of next year. One final note, we do not anticipate issuing additional new equity beyond what we had planned to issue even with the recognition of additional costs for the extension of schedule at Kemper County. We will continue to assess on a consolidated basis, the level of equity capital needed to maintain our financial integrity. This will be a function of many factors including potential changes to our CapEx forecast and potential extension of bonus depreciation. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Tom Fanning :  Thanks, Art. As Art indicated we were having great success at Solar Power, in fact Southern Power\u2019s accomplishments are only one example of our growing reputation as a national leader in the development of solar resources. Notably in Georgia, in addition to the approval of Georgia Power\u2019s advanced solar initiative that Georgia public service commission recently approved 3 rate-based solar project totaling approximately 90 megawatts at Forts Benning, Stewart, and Gordon.  These projects are expected to be the largest solar generation facilities operating on any U.S. military base. In addition, the commission recognized a memoranda of understanding between Georgia Power and the U.S. Navy to build a 30 megawatt solar facility at Kings Bay Submarine Base near St. Mary\u2019s, Georgia. Final approval of this project is expected soon. In recognition of these initiatives, which could increase Georgia Power solar resources to nearly 900 megawatt by 2016, Georgia Power was recently named the 2014 Investor Owned utility of the year by the Solar Electric Power Association. Renewable energy is just one component of our commitment to build the nations only truly diversified generation portfolio, one that makes use of new nuclear, 21st century coal, natural gas, renewable and energy efficiency. Our ability to balance field diversity benefits customers directly by helping keep prices well below the national average. Add to that our industry leading reliability as evidence by our 2014 summer peak season E4 of 1.6% compared to the most recent 5 year national average of around 9%. Likewise, our transmission and distribution businesses have performed superbly with our rate of service interruptions and the duration of those interruptions at historically low level. As a result it\u2019s no wonder, our four traditional franchise utilities scored the four highest customer satisfaction ratings among national peer utilities this year as measured by our annual customer value benchmark survey. I\u2019m intensely focused as the entire management team here at Southern on startup activities at Kemper County. Despite those challenges, the Southern company franchise is in a good shape as it has ever been. Our customer focus business model with its emphasis on outstanding reliability exceptional customer service and prices well below the national average remains the cornerstone of our business and a key driver of long-term value to Southern company shareholders. We are now ready to take your questions. So operator, we\u2019ll now take the first question. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed. Greg Gordon - ISI Group :  So can we talk about the CapEx forecast a bit? Tom Fanning :  Sure. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : So on two fronts, one on Southern Power, you've indicated you're doing really well finding opportunities to put that placeholder capital to work, a lot of it in solar, and that you're going to reassess whether there's an opportunity to spend more basically. Do you see a big enough opportunity to put capital to work at a good enough return that it could move you outside of the 3% to 4% earnings guidance range that you've laid out for people for 2014 to 2016 or is it sort of it pushes you around inside that range? Tom Fanning :  Hey Greg, let\u2019s carry that conversation next February. I\u2019m a little hesitant to get into kind of revising the forward forecast let\u2019s just say that we\u2019ve had a better than expected rate of success in solar so far using up all of our kind of allocation for CapEx there in solar and I think the presumption is that there is opportunities to do more with respect to the long-term forecast we\u2019ll handle that in February, that\u2019s okay. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Let me ask the question a little differently then. The assumption inside the current guidance was that you'd spend the $1.4 billion? Tom Fanning : That\u2019s right. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : And earn some sort of reasonable return on that capital; is that fair? Tom Fanning :  Yes. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Okay. My second question goes to everything you're seeing on the economic development front, seems like things are going really well. The industrial load has been great. At what point do you reassess your 2015, \u201816, \u201817, \u201818 CapEx forecast in light of any sort of upside changes in the economic forecast? Or do you think that sort of sufficient to have the infrastructure you need to keep it with the way the economy is ramping? Tom Fanning :  I think I got it, Greg. As we look forward I think you are talking about new capacity additions I assume. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Yes, or increased distribution spending because of housing formation? You name it. Tom Fanning :  There will be some minor affects there but new generation still in the mid 2020s, at least under the current economic forecast that we have. So it would be on the line so more distribution growth to serve some of these customers maybe some transmission but it wouldn\u2019t be a lot at least into the current forecast. Art Beattie :  Yeah Greg, the other thing I would just add. There is enormous swing variable and that deals with where EPA is going to come out with this Carbon rule 1-11D find their own calculation this is EPA\u2019s own calculation not ours. They would have projected to build over 5,000 megawatt to combine cycles by 2020. Now I don\u2019t think that a practical assumption not only given the lead times required to build combined cycles plus considering the state of natural gas infrastructure in the Southeast. So my sense is these things are going to have to be bit more fluid than what EPA is assuming. But depending on how that rule turns out you could see a swing in CapEx also. Operator :  And our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse :  Tom, I just want to make sure I'm not reading too much into your comment on Vogtle, but you made a comment about ongoing pressure on the construction cycle, but you guys thought still manageable. Did I hear that correctly and can you just maybe give a little more color on what's going on that's putting some pressure on timelines? Tom Fanning :  Yeah I guess it\u2019s out there. SCANA has had some announcements about schedule and cost and all that and we have not I think that\u2019s an obvious kind of conclusion people who make. I would just point to the fact without commenting on SCANA\u2019s situation, that we have a different side and different state of construction and certainly a different contract. Our contract is essentially a fixed price turnkey arrangement. And while there is always a challenge with respect to cost and schedule. I think given the commercial status of our contract with Consortium, we have been assured by Consortium personnel that in fact we can\u2019t meet the schedule. It\u2019s always a challenge it\u2019s subject to change, but we believe as we sit here right now that we can go in service Unit 3 at the end of \u201917 and in service unit for at the end of \u201918. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Then just kind of against the Kemper rule of thumb, the $20 million to $30 million a month for the delays, would that not apply in the Vogtle situation because of the contract you guys have in place? Or something.. Tom Fanning :  If there were a schedule delay that would be owners cost. Essentially overhead cost with our own over site. But certainly the cost involved with housing workers and whatever other time related cost was really for the account of the Consortium. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Okay, thank you. And then I guess one last question, on the solar development, we've talked to you about the yield co\u2019s before, but can you explain where you guys are taking advantage to win some of these projects rather than relative to the yield co's? You seemingly have reasonably low cost of capital at this point? Art Beattie : Yeah Dan this is Art Beattie. We feel like we have got a lot of the relationships with the developers out there. we have done a lot of projects with the likes of First Solar, the one thing I know is when they do a deal with us that we are going to be able to close, and we are going to be able to in an efficient manner. We have access to low cost capital with decent credit rating. So we still feel like we can be competitive.  This recent transaction that we did with First Solar was a little different than some of the others. We basically bought not only 51% of the operating asset but basically the vast majority of the tax benefit. So we are finding different ways to get deals done and this was what we thought was be a win-win for both Southern Power and for First Solar. And we think that both parties are pretty happy with. Tom Fanning :  The other thing I will just add here too is, you know that we have been very careful about not over expanding on our tax appetite we have found ourselves in a substantial carry forward position that we have always kind of been very careful about tax advantaged investing. I think given that we do have a tax appetite and that we have a strategic kind of reason for being in this space. It gives us a very nice niche in this market that seems to be evolving and I think we tend to be a pretty attractive partner for that reason and all the reasons Art just mentioned. So, my sense is there will be some more opportunities ahead. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse :  The $1.2 billion of CapEx you're able to spend with the tax credits coming back to you, with bonus depreciation, would that affect your ability to monetize some of those benefits, if you think about perpetuating this level of investment or can you manage bonus and these tax credits? Tom Fanning :  One can only say what\u2019s going to happen with balances and move things slightly through time but even if you get some enormous sense of new tax benefits it won\u2019t move us but a year or so. So, does that shift your IRR curve? Sure but it\u2019s not in a substantial way. Nothing like multiple years of carry forward. Operator :  Our next question is from Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital, please proceed. Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital :  A couple questions, the first one is on the fourth quarter earnings estimate. Can you remind us what would drive the $0.11 decline year-over-year? Tom Fanning :  Well, if you go back and look at our fourth quarter earnings let\u2019s say 2010 forward there is a pretty good variability in our level of earnings in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s subject to where we are at the end of the third and that\u2019s true this year. We plan on making up for what year-to-date been and under spending of our non-fuel O&M and as you know we traditionally do that in the last half of the year and in this case a lot of that will be done in the fourth quarter. So that is the main driver in the reduction and year-over-year earnings from 2013 and the fourth quarter to 2014 and the fourth quarter. I think we did a presentation at one of the investor conferences where we were able to show that over the past 10 years or so we\u2019ve hit our range 100% of the time we can\u2019t ever guarantee that going forward but that is our past history. You know that for a long time we\u2019ve had a practice of being able to structure our O&M spending in such a way that we essentially account for through optionality, variability in weather and through a reasonable variability in economics sales forecast coming to fruition and et cetera. My sense is we\u2019ll continue that practice of matching in the fourth quarter here. Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital : Okay. Second question is on the dividend, a lot of folks are raising their dividend more than historical rates. I just wanted to get a sense as to what you're thinking about the dividend, especially as it relates to a GAAP payout ratio going forward. Tom Fanning :  So, we\u2019ve been very consistent with this one of the Southern mantras here is regular predictable sustainable increases in earnings per share which provide the regular predictable sustainable increases in dividends per share. For a long time, now we\u2019ve been on a $0.07 per year increase in the dividend per share rate while this ultimately is the decision of the Southern Company Board, management is in a position where we believe very strong we\u2019ll be able to continue that trajectory for years to come. Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital : Okay, just double checking. Thank you. Tom Fanning :  Thank you. Operator :  And our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank, please proceed. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank :  Could I just ask you to maybe clarify how the accounting will work on the solar deal in the fourth quarter and perhaps quantify what the impact on the quarter is? Art Beattie :  Yes, Jonathan, this is Art. Basically the solar gen 2 project will I believe provide about $30 million of net income on its own. And/or so and then there are some other year-over-year effects that will mitigate that number somewhat for Southern Power along with the other expenses at Southern that I talked about on the earlier call that will get us to our 237 estimate. But we can give you more detail on that if you like offline Jonathan but basically it will be 51% the cash flow will go to us. and we\u2019ll get the vast majority of the investment tax credit. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : In terms of timing of how that gets booked, is that all being booked in Q4? Tom Fanning :  That\u2019s our expectation. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Okay, so the ongoing number will be less, but $30 million is the right number to use in the quarter? Tom Fanning :  That\u2019s approximately correct. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Tom Fanning :  But there are lots of details in there around basis differences and how much -- so we can give you more detail on that. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Second topic, I was just curious, can you shed a bit more light, Tom, maybe on what you said the project managers have sort of recommended and you have agreed that you should sort of be more methodical about how you work through startup. Is there a practice, this is obviously a significant delay in a large number. Can you give us more color as to what exactly you're going to do differently and how you've arrived at that determination? Tom Fanning :  Sure and I just want to tell all you investors of Southern that I'll bet you I'm more frustrated than you are and I certainly empathize with any of you that are frustrated. I can tell you that we have had very direct candid tough conversations with the team on executing on this. What the more methodical approach deals with is essentially an extended schedule that relates to training. Recall not only is this an Electric project but it is a chemical and gas process project. There is specialized training and given this is first of a kind technology we are doing kind of a more methodical approach to moving people through all facets of any kind of operational requirements with respect to running this plant. The second we talked about a lot over time and that deals with recall you talk about how complex the integration of this project is and we often use kind of the example of in order to get a combined cycle plant to work you need to integrate three system. This plant has 13 systems. One of the efforts that we are spending a lot of time on in order to do it well is essentially the digital control equipment and the simulator associated with that and so as you would think about the challenges involved in integrating these 13 processes we are following that through on the simulator as well and that also extends to training so that when we get the digital control equipment exactly the way we want it and the simulator the way we want it and the training the way we want it, we will have moved people through again an extended process whereby when we reach the intended in service date, we're ready to go. And I would point to when we turned on the combined cycle it has worked beautifully. Did we have to fine tune it a bit? Yes but overall when you look at the performance of that part of the plant, fantastic and when we looked at whatever we've completed on construction and the pressure testing we've done so far and everything else, the plant has performed well.  Our intention is to do start up so that at the end of the day this plant operates as well as it can when we put it into service. The final piece of all of this is adding a little more time into the startup processes. The packages, the turnover packages, the execution of the checkout of the systems, the analog to this and the nuclear world would be the I-tax. In other words, as we go through the various turning on the various systems before we get them all to run together, just being very kind of methodical there also allowing more time. So I guess what I'm saying when you consider training all personnel and all facets of this plant when you consider the integration of the digitized system and the simulator when you consider the time involved in going through the startup processes of all of the segments, we have added more time in there. We've had a lot of tough discussions about this like I say. I'm frustrated with it. I think this is the best of our judgment and I think this approach is painful in the short-term but I think it gives us the best long-term results that will demonstrate the value of this technology. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank :  So I am following up one thing you just said. It seems you might be suggesting that you don't really have the training protocols established to your satisfaction yet so you've got to do that and then implement the training or is it just. Am I understanding that right? Tom Fanning :  No. Here is the deal. In this world it\u2019s called PSM. It\u2019s called Process safety Management and that involves when you basically it\u2019s a regime under which procedures have to be followed. When you turn the plant on an introduce gas live into the turbine. That is the whole new regime. There are no right lifelines about how you must operate. And I think we have brought in a lot external consultants here people that worked at Chevron, people that worked at BP and other places. And I would say here again our approach rather than trying to push something that might qualify we are taking more time to do more in terms of training, so that everybody is essentially up to speed on all facets of the plant. For example, one thing you could do is just train certain people of certain aspects of the plant. We're taking this methodical approach to make sure that we have the best kind of foundation for a safe, reliable operation once we go in service. Operator : And our next question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc, please proceed. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Good afternoon. You indicated that, despite the latest Kemper write-off, you don't think you need to backfill equities, protect the balance sheet. Where are you finding that upside? Unidentified Company Representative : Well, we and as I said in the call or in the script we continue to look at it on a consolidated basis. We, as you know we\u2019ve contemplated issuing 600 million of equity this year we\u2019re on very we\u2019re on track to do that we may in fact issue just to hear more than that this year but we\u2019ll see. So at the end of this year we should be in fine shape and as we move forward it\u2019s going to be a function of our need for capital which is also a function of our CapEx is also a function of accelerated depreciation opportunities and those things. So, it\u2019s difficult for me to sit here and be premature to say I\u2019ll need X amount of equity in order to do this. But based on our plans we assumed no new issuances of equity in \u201915 and \u201916. When we look at the plans that we have in place we already had shall we say placeholder\u2019s room for additional problems elsewhere for example at Kemper or somewhere else. What we\u2019re seeing at Kemper fits within those thresholds and within those thresholds we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll need to issue new equity and what Art is referring to is one of the big swing that I would see is what if Southern Power has lots more opportunity that could give rise depending on the way tax law changes that could give rise but we already had contemplated we had placeholders, room so that the kind of equity issuances we talked about and really turning off equity was already provided for, we\u2019re well within where we think we need to be from an equity capitalization standpoint.  The last thing I\u2019ll just mention here when you look at our profile in terms of reducing CapEx compared to our rather immense invested capital base we started trailing off cash flow and one of the things we suggested in the past still is in front of it as an option and that is reducing our equity capitalization as a percent. So, my sense is we\u2019ve room. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: So you're just kind of eating into the head room that you built in conservatively? Tom Fanning : That\u2019s the way we plan. Art Beattie : And things continue to evolve, so we\u2019ll evaluate that and will assess it as we move through that. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Kind of going out on a limb here given your conservative DNA, would you guys ever think of an alternative financial structure like a yield co? Tom Fanning : Boy, I did in one of the recent conferences I did a presentation on yield co. and I don\u2019t think they make sense for Southern, if you\u2019re interested in the something other than the reader\u2019s digest version I would be glad to give it to you, I don\u2019t think they make sense for us. Operator : And our next question Is from line of Michael Weinstein with UBS, please proceed. Michael Weinstein - UBS: A lot of my questions already answered so I just want to follow up on the throwing off of cash flow, you're saying that might also be Vogtle and Kemper together will eventually be cash flow producers so that you might be able to withstand a little more of a lower equity ratio until they do? Is that basically what you're saying? Tom Fanning : That\u2019s correct, it would be after those are operational and that was start depreciating those assets is going to be throwing out a lot of cash. Michael Weinstein - UBS: Also, is there any consideration of other than solar in Southern Power, such as biomass opportunities or any opportunities in other forms of renewable energy? Tom Fanning : Yes, sure. One that we looked at in the past it was way back in my time as CFO, those of you who have been around that long may remember we used to have a placeholder in the plan for like $250 million of wind and we used to push around on all the different wind deals. The reason we\u2019ve always been bullish on solar is that it had direct application into our service territory and so therefore we loved especially PV solar we want really bullish on thermal solar. When we thought about wind especially looking at the portfolio and that time frame we were of the opinion that the risk return profile really didn\u2019t fit us given some of the technology challenges and some of the other challenges that industry was facing. What we\u2019re seeing now is a more technology certainly in term of technology it seems like there is two or three kind of really mature ways to harvest wind energy and recall also that wind doesn\u2019t make sense really in the Southeast except for maybe offshore. We don\u2019t the climatology so my comment on wind as a potential would be that I think we\u2019re finding that area to be a bit more suitable and we would most likely do with other than the South East so that\u2019s something we could do. We\u2019re very happy with our biomass deal in Texas. That was the largest bubbling bed technology in North America, I guess it\u2019s a biggest in the world, that was the biggest biomass plant in North America when it was built and unlike Kemper, we built that on time, on schedule and it worked beautifully. To the extent there are other biomass facilities available we will certainly look at that. They come and go on our project development with given all the environmental issues it\u2019s kind of hard to get those done, but we certainly consider that. and let me just lead you with all this discussion about renewals for us gas is still the priority. We think we are preeminent competitive generator in gas and we have just the terrific track record of executing there.  So what if EPA comes forward and they start requiring more shutdowns of coal and more gas to be build we are going to be very well positioned to help executing that. Michael Weinstein - UBS: Thanks . Do you have any kind of estimate as to what the timeline of EPA is at this point where they stand on the issue? Tom Fanning : You know that, I guess it was yesterday, there was kind of a new alert out they were willing to rethink some of the points of their proposed rule. But what I understand right now, and this is very premature, we're just kind of understanding what's in that latest update is that they are going to try and maintain the same schedule of responses and final rule making. So my sense is you're going to see responses by around December 1 and you're going to see a final rule next summer. Operator :  And we have a question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Hey Tom. Two questions for you. One, can you give a little insight, it\u2019s been a couple quarters now in terms of the big spread between what you're seeing in weather normalized industrial demand versus what you're seeing in weather normalized commercial and residential demand. That's one question, second totally unrelated. Can you give an update at all on the litigation between you and the Consortium members regarding some of the I think it was like $900 million or so of potential cost related to Vogel? Tom Fanning : Yes you know what I'm going to do? Give you a top answer on the first one and let Art dive into more detail there. The second one on the litigation I think I can hit pretty easily and I don't mean to sound glib here but there's just nothing much to report. We continue to have very productive discussions. We need with Phil Asherman and Danny Roderick and members of Toshiba regularly, there are portal meetings, we get along, we solve problems but you know there's two ways to think about how those discussions occur. One is between us and the Consortium and the other is within the Consortium they have obligations. And so it's not just as simple as us and them, it's them and them.  So that's about all I can say on that. There's always been a big difference in weather between industrial and residential and commercial. Industrial sales just aren't very weather sensitive. Certainly, the residential and commercial are. Art do you want to give more color there? Art Beattie : Michael as I said in the script, a lot of its driven by household income and the lack of growth in household income. If you look at the split of residential between growth in customers and growth in usage. Growth in customers was actually positive 0.7% I think on a year-to-date basis and growth in usage has been a negative 0.6 so I mean we're flat. So that's an indication that our people are sitting in their kitchens trying to make decisions on how to make the budgets work and so we're feeling the effects of some of that.  I think you're also seeing that true say at Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart lowered their sales forecast growth for the same reason. Another factor to think about on a residential side. When we look at new customer additions about 35% of our new customer additions are in multi-family homes rather than single family homes. Our existing customer base is about 20% multi-family. So, multi-family additions use about 70% of the energy of a single family home so that could be another factor, so because we add a new customer it doesn't mean that they are all the same. These are factors that we have to think about as we move forward and try to predict where sales are going to be. Tom Fanning : I gave some comments on this. I did this morning just a bit and that very kind of interesting exchange with Joe Kernan, but I think the Fed and economists all over have over shot where we thought we would be on GDP recovery and I think that it's because you have a bit of a false signal, a false positive on improving unemployment when you consider the jobs that are getting there, they are getting filled, are lower paying service related jobs compared to the past when you consider more part time labor accounted for when you consider disaffected workers. Household incomes are generally flat and you know, that's what we've got to look to. The people that are having flat incomes making tough kitchen table economic decisions as Art said aren't spending money. And I think they have this kind of psychological issue of dealing with the recent recession and something that I don't think is all bad is savings rates are up so people are consuming less. I don't think that's all bad. We don't need an economy and peoples income leading on the edge I actually kind of I\u2019m okay with where we\u2019re on that but that seems to be I think in my opinion a more important statistics than household incomes than say unemployment. Art Beattie :  Yes, I was going to comment on the commercial and unless you want to ask a different question. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs :  No, that's exactly where I was going. Art Beattie :  Okay, the commercial side it\u2019s still flat slightly negative if you do the splits there customer growth is up but usage is down and so what we see in Georgia particularly around Atlanta was an overbuilt market especially in the retail side and especially in the office side and it\u2019s a little different. The parameter is doing great but the center city, there is a lots of vacancy. So, it\u2019s a different story depending on where you go but the other thing on the retail side is the what I call the amazon.com effect is the fact that more shipments are being made by mail and by the internet I think they doubled since 2009 and so you\u2019re seeing that effect on the vacancy issues around the retail space. Tom Fanning :  When Art said parameter he is referring to a highway that runs in a ring centrally around Atlanta it\u2019s about 60 mile long highway around Atlanta. So that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing some commercial growth rather than the internal kind of core part of city. Operator :  And our next question is from line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar Financial, please proceed. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Financial :  Hey, good afternoon guys. Just a couple of follow-up questions, actually, on that last point. I might have missed it, but when you talk about some of these factors that are underpinning the changes in residential and commercial demand, can you talk about what maybe your look forward is for 2015? I know you do a lot of work on your numbers and a final kind of demand not expecting that kind of a number, but what you sort of see in your forecast and in your budgets up to this point and how that's going to impact 2015 versus 2014 so far? Tom Fanning :  Again it\u2019s going to be a function of the economy as it is always is and we don\u2019t want to get out and find out where we\u2019re going to be February, we\u2019ll talk more robustly in February when we have our revised numbers but if you go back to the 2014 forecast for \u201914 to \u201916, it was roughly a 1% growth maybe a little stronger than that as you move through the year \u201916. But again we redo that every year and we\u2019ll comment more on that in February about our new look. Art Beattie :  And without regard to the future, this year our plan was based off 0.7% retail sales and it\u2019s one. So we are reasonably above where we thought we\u2019d be, so the question that we\u2019ll answer in February is what\u2019s our forward guess on that. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Financial : Okay, and just a quick one on Southern Power. Obviously solar has been in the headlines and you've had some nice progress there so far this year. I'm just wondering, given where in generation economics have moved for a lot of people this year, have you seen any interesting gas projects that you'd be considering or is that sort of lower priority at this point? Tom Fanning :  Yes, we actually think there are some on the shelf I want to kind of lay low on that but you want to know a really good kind of target audience with respect to those projects are co-ops and municipal utilities. We have a great track record of serving them here in the South East I would bet you 40 years ago they were kind of the enemy and now they are great partners and they\u2019re wonderful people and we\u2019ve got along great and produced I think really good business results for them and us and I think our reputation is proceeding us and I think we have around the United States more prospects to do more such deals with other co-ops and communities in the United States away from the South East. So I think there will be some opportunity there. And I\u2019ll tell you something now, you know that outside of South East in the United States may presume that we\u2019re in the so called organized market. Our business model will remain the same long-term bilateral contract, credit worthy counter parties, no fuel risk no transmission risk. That\u2019s the way we like to do it. Operator :  Our next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley, please proceed. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley :  Hey gentlemen. Most of my questions have been covered, I just wondered if we could discuss the Sanmen nuclear project in China and just generally interested in your thoughts on progress there, lessons learned for the US, or sort of as you look at execution risk in China, how's that project been going? Tom Fanning :  Well, we\u2019ve had people that live in China that kind of work around that site and we have teams of people that regularly visit sandman to bring back those learning. I would bet you I don\u2019t know I would love to see what buzz\u2019s opinion is here something like up that you 60% of what they do is applicable to what we do where we\u2019re different than them is in the degree of automation particularly in welding practices, they tend to use a lot more manpower, we tend to use a lot more automation. And it worked pretty well. We kind of believe that they are going to be in service sometime later 2015 and as they commissioned that plan that will be very helpful. The other thing that has been helpful to us is they are dealing with some issues with the vendor for example the design of reactor cooling pumps. And I think as they resolved those problems that will out benefit. Operator :  And our next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Just a couple questions, Art, can you remind us, through the nine months, how much equity you've issued so far this year? Art Beattie : We're right at $500 million through September 30. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And if I heard right you may cross the $600 million by the time the year is over? Art Beattie :  Yeah, but it\u2019s not completely significant. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Then, can you also remind us, on a normalized basis, what's the O&M base we should be thinking about for you guys and the growth rate of that going forward? Art Beattie : Yeah, Ali, I think what we outlined for this year is that we would be in the if you look at total Southern, we would be just over 4 billion and I think we're going to be very close to that number if we spend what we're going to spend. And as we move forward I'd say a 3% growth rate, maybe 3% to 3.5%. Two of that would be just 2% and 2.5% just core and the other 1% would be related to environmental, environmental O&M. As we start up all these environmental projects that adds a different layer of O&M to the core amount. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. My third question, can you remind us why was Southern Power down so significantly quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter? Related to that then, the Solar Gen 2 project in the past, Tom, you've talked about the run rate of net income for Southern Power around the $170 million a year level. How should we now think of that with the portfolio changes going forward? Art Beattie :  Yeah, Ali I think what I said and we actually checked this in preparation of this call. I think I gave a range to about 145 to 175 somewhere around there. and I think we are going to end year at the upper end of that range. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay, and why was it down? Tom Fanning :  It was benefited from solar revenues this year, additional plants and things versus last. But there was some particularly high depreciation expense related to new plant and service. There was a slight change in the methodology went to a units of production method of depreciation that also caused the delta. And then we did some major outage work at one of our units where we had to really catch up on some accelerated retirements just due to the accounting issues related to that one particular plant and that really drove a lot of expense into Q3 of this year versus last. That's why it's down quarter-to-quarter. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Tom, to be clear are you suggesting that, call it, $170 million to $175 million run rate, is that a good run rate going forward as well or does that change with the Solar Gen 2 and other activity that you've done there? Art Beattie :  So if I recall kind of the forward curve, Southern Power in the near term had a decent run rate kind of $160 to $170 something like that. It certainly picks up what you have is kind of a filler. We have contracted capacity that picks up again at a certain timeframe. So at the end of the decade it goes up into the 200. But for now I think it\u2019s a decent assumption and certainly we will update you in February on that. Operator :  And we have a question from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. David Paz - Wolfe Research :  Okay, this is David Paz for Fleishman. Just a quick question, Tom. Going back to Vogtle, do you expect a -- is there a timeline for when you get a new schedule for post-2015? Tom Fanning : It's under consideration right now. They are rebaselining and what they're working hard on is see what you always kind of work on here is you have heard that they have had some challenges out of their Lake Charles facility and so the Consortium is working hard on mitigating whatever challenges that they see, certainly with respect to the schedule, and they're obligated to meet that schedule to us via the contract. So one of the things that we meet with them on when I say that Asherman and Roderick and the pertinent members of Toshiba get together. It is to give us the new schedule, right now they know that they have a commercial responsibility to fulfill and so we look forward to seeing how they\u2019re going to do that. So that\u2019s kind of it I don\u2019t have a time frame in which we will see a new schedule but I can tell you that as a topic of current conversation. Operator :  Our next question is from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Capital, please proceed. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital :  Good afternoon, Tom. Earlier during the call, you referenced your tax appetite. I'm wondering if you can both kind of, in a cumulative sense, give a sense of what your cumulative tax appetite is and kind of like the options in which you are looking at in order to optimize that and whether the optimization of that balance has been considered as part of your forward views that you have provided us in the past? Tom Fanning :  Yes, when you say tax appetite a lot of it varies on bonus depreciation or not so that the numbers going to swing around the good bit absent kind of an extension of bonus depreciation our number would imply and investment appetite of over $2.5 billion. So to the extent you get bonus depreciation path it could subtract, it is current form, we got current bonus depreciation extended again. It would probably take away about 1 billion of that over 2.5 billion number and I\u2019m being very general here because there is a lot of uncertainty with respect to how these things manifest themselves but that would be a decent working number for you to think about. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital : In terms of the way to utilize a lot of these tax deferrals and everything like that, usually, I think, you were implying earlier about taxable income creation or acquisition in order to optimize utilization of various renewable credits and those types of things. Can you expand a little bit on that if I understood you properly or how we should think about that? Art Beattie :  I\u2019m not sure Vedu I mean what that basically says is in normal circumstances Southern Company is a tax payer and our kind of cash tax rate on our booked taxes there are cash tax rate is reasonably high. To the extent, we get bonus depreciation or something else that serves to reduce our effective cash tax rate I think right now this year I\u2019m going to say our effective cash tax rate is around 7% or 8%. So there is still a little bit of headroom. It\u2019s those kinds of factors so my sense is when you look at our normal business we don\u2019t have significant tax deferral items in play. So letting the system run on its own, we become a full tax payer. That gives rise to the $2.5 million, $2.6 billion investment opportunity given the extension of investment tax credit or solar and wind and everything else to the extent that moves from a 30% number to a 10% ITC number than your investment opportunity your appetite actually goes up. So there is a lot of swing here, what I try to do is outlined what I like is caveman math. Under current circumstances without an extension, you\u2019re somewhere in the $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion investment opportunity range. Obviously that can swing. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital : And these are all cash items? This doesn't affect what we end up seeing on the GAAP financials? This is all cash flow items in terms of how these things swing, correct? Tom Fanning :  Well in term of calculating tax appetite that\u2019s right ultimately there is a book income impact such as Art described on solar gen 2. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital : Okay. If next week or whatever, with the elections, if the republicans get the Senate, you're particularly talking about bonus depreciation extension or whatever. If, like I said, if that comes to pass, given the folks you've talked to, what do you think is reasonable or feasible that could occur that's relevant to your business that you'd like? Tom Fanning :  That\u2019s just pure speculation, my sense is you\u2019re going to see some sort of extender bill whether the democrats hold the Senate or whether the republicans get it. Whether it\u2019s a permanent, whether it\u2019s a two year, whether you\u2019ll extend that kind of the provisions related to wind and solar, my sense is whichever party get the Senate, you\u2019re going to see something that would be my guess. It may also depend on how comprehensive they want to go and therefore what the timing will be of the implementation of that. Operator :  Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed. Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC :  Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to hit on Kemper, two questions. One is, you gave a risk of a schedule each month, the cost that shareholders could bear. I just want to know, is there any regulatory risk associated with that seven-year settlement that the gasifier's not in service. Was that part of the settlement that had to be in service by a certain date? The second question is, when do we get through the forest here? Is there a point in the schedule where the gasifier goes online and that's when we could exhale or another point in time where we know the write-offs are behind us? Tom Fanning :  It does not include anything for the settlement the grand proposal we are working. And certainly there is risk in that, I can\u2019t say that there is not. What I can say about the settlement is we continue to have productive discussion but I can\u2019t predict the outcome of those discussions. What was the other thing you wanted? Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : I really wanted to know . Tom Fanning :  Yes. When are we going to get first gas through the gasifier? When is that? Art Beattie :  That\u2019s scheduled till July of \u201915. Tom Fanning :  Summer of \u201915. That will be a big deal. What we will provide you in EEI is essentially a chart that will layout kind of three club, segments of risk. One is all the milestones that we need to accomplish before we get gas to the turbines and then kind of once we get gas to the turbines we are the milestones following that. And like again I think we are looking at summer of \u201915 for that event to occur. That\u2019s kind of what I would say in a broad sense we will have more detail for you actually we will hand out that thing in Dallas. Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Just lastly I guess with the gasifier. Anything about seven-year global settlement. How much of that I guess what\u2019s in rate base or what is been recovering rates it\u2019s related to the gasifier. Art Beattie :  Well we have rates in place an 18% increase associated with 2.4 total capital investment that we earned on. There are securitization bonds that take us to $2.88 billion. Those are all represented by rates. It\u2019s hard to say if you wanted the segment out what is currently part of the combined cycle, I would say something like $900 million to a 1 billion somewhere around there of the $2.88 billion. Round numbers again. Operator :  Our next question is from the line of Kit Connelly with BCG. Please proceed. Kit Connelly - BCG Partners : Lot of my questions have been answered. I thought I'd inquire about your interest in the pipeline business. As you say, you burned a lot of gas in your power plants, utility in Southern Power and a couple of the big companies around you next year into Florida and Duke and Dominion have talked about the Atlantic coast pipeline. How do you look at the pipeline business as far as your forward book of business goes? Tom Fanning :  So it\u2019s interesting. We actually go through a process of pretty disciplined pretty rigorous here whenever we think about different companies or different lines of business. And frankly we just covered this with our Board a week ago and our offset kind of strategy Board meeting. And the way I tend to think about it is kind of the red, yellow green chart. So green for us would be an integrated regulated electric utility with make move and sell elements within that. Yellow, to me, would be things like a gas pipeline. It has kind of a similar risk return characteristic, it is not necessarily something we know in depth and that we decades of experience with like we do with others. But it is certainly something we would consider. You are right when people think about Southern Company we will run into it from time to time. People think we are big coal company. We are still big but rest assured that Southern Company I think is the third largest consumer of natural gas in the United States. Gas is a part of our future and that will become increasingly important. And so therefore it make sense for us to consider gas oriented investments along the way. So Kit it\u2019s something we absolutely would consider. Operator :  And we have follow-up question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Thanks, Tom. Quick question for you, on page 12 of your handout, you show your Q3 gas combined cycle capacity factors up to 76% versus 68%. Non-PRB is up 44% versus 40%. Where do you see your capacity factor for gas going into the fourth quarter? Where do you think you'll end up for the year? Because it's been quite a turnaround as natural gas prices have come down, right? Tom Fanning :  Yes, I mean Greg you\u2019re all over it. I think just depends on kind of what the weather hold and everything else but we\u2019re seeing sub $4 gas right now you\u2019re going to see pretty strong performance by our combined cycle fleet over time. At some time -- . Greg Gordon - ISI Group :  Do you think you'll be at or above the 66% capacity factor you ended the year at last year at the rate you're currently running? Tom Fanning :  Pure gas. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Thank you. Tom Fanning :  Depends on a host of factors but yes if you asked me to bet, I would bet. Operator :  And our next question is from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital, please proceed. Andy Levi - Avon Capital : Just to make sure, because I think when you said this, I didn't hear it correctly. I meant that stuff came out right when it was being discussed, but what did you say about rebaselining in the consortium? Did you say you were expecting them to come back with rebaselining? Tom Fanning :  Sure, the question I think I forget to even ask if somebody asked the right question and that is in fact the consortium SCANA talks about and they are coming back to us with schedule that will meet our in service date. And in talking with senior management we believe that can be done. Now in order for that to be done they\u2019ve had a lack of performance particularly in Lake Charles facility. And so you\u2019re always in this position of mitigation. So to the extent Lake Charles doesn\u2019t perform the way you wanted it to what they\u2019ll do is essentially farm business out as they have to Newport News to make sure that we get the material and the documentation I think was pointed out appropriately in a suitable manner. So, the consortium is working hard to mitigate whatever operational challenges they have, that is always been the case, we believe they can mitigate to the extent they preserve in service date. That\u2019s all that is, that\u2019s an ongoing process. Andy Levi - Avon Capital : Again, from what I think you're saying is, either you stay on schedule and costs to stay on schedule could potentially go higher to stay on schedule or costs could kind of not go up as much and the timeline would slip. Is that kind of the way to think about it? Tom Fanning :  Well here is the way I\u2019d think about it. You get into, they\u2019re going to provide at the schedule that mitigate any problem they have so that they can abide by the contract we have which is essentially a fixed price turnkey contract. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that they try to issue change orders to that effect but whether or not we accept the change orders depends on what cause the delay or whatever. If it is their own performance it\u2019s for their account, if it is because the NRC did something which may then do something different then that would be a changed order that we would likely accept. Right now, we believe that they are down to deliver a plan in service and we believe they can deliver it and we look forward to they\u2019re meeting their obligations under contract. And I guess we have good constructive conversations with these folks. Andy Levi - Avon Capital : When do you think you should hear from them and then us hear from you? Would that be in the fourth quarter or would that be some time in 2015? Tom Fanning :  We\u2019re having conversations with them right now and I think the other thing I\u2019d try to suggest I hope I wasn\u2019t too obscure when I did it. I was talking about the consortium in respect of the commercial dispute and I said it isn\u2019t just between us and the consortium, is there an effect is a my words but there is a relationship an accreditor agreement, whatever, there was a sharing agreement within the consortium among them between Westinghouse and CVI overwritten by Toshiba. So, to the extent there are commercial obligations that the consortium have to fulfill they have to decide at partners, how they\u2019re going to fulfill that. That really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with us. It\u2019s those issues which have to be worked, which complicates the delivery to us of our fully mitigated schedule. We continue to work constructively on it and we look forward to that happening in the next few months or so. I can\u2019t guarantee what date in which we will get a fully mitigated schedule but we\u2019re working on it. Andy Levi - Avon Capital : Got it. Then just back on earlier question as well, same subject mat, going back in time, so on the original dispute between Westinghouse, CVI, and your group, what exactly is going on there? Were there actually talks going on or is there an arbitrator or are we kind of just in the court stage that's going to take a while? Can you give us any update on that? Because I guess CVI seems to suggest on their call, again, it was just kind of a one liner, that things hadn't moved along anywhere on that or were not going. Tom Fanning :  Well look what I can say is this. We are in litigation mode, so in other words we are going through periods of discovery. We are taking depositions. I can get you detail on when we think hearings will begin and all that of course that\u2019s all subject to what judge ruling on certain matter whereas the venue is Augusta Georgia. That\u2019s kind of where we are. At the same time parallel activity we are having settlement discussions with the consortium and they are very cordial. So this is not bomb throwing and missile launching, this is good constructive talk. And I am trying to convey that it\u2019s not just us and them it\u2019s them and them with us. Andy Levi - Avon Capital :  I understand. So basically, there are talks going on, but at the same time, parallel the court process continues. It could take quite some time to play out. Is that fair? Andy Levi - Avon Capital :  That\u2019s right sure. And we would love to settle but we are also prepared to go to litigation as we get a settlement that is desirable for the benefit of our customers. Andy Levi - Avon Capital :  Just as far as the costs for that or any rebaseline, just to understand, that's something that would be negotiated, it sounds like, based on your contract between CVI and Westinghouse? And your position right now, at this stage, is that you're not willing -- well I don't want to negotiate on the telephone. But basically we should expect those two to be paying that difference, at least it's your position at this point, is that kind of fair? There's some big dollars involved. Tom Fanning :  My only point is, it\u2019s pretty clear then public knowledge there been some challenges with material coming out of Lake Charles. As a way to help mitigate their challenges and fulfilling their obligations under the contract, they've enlisted some subcontractors, for example, Newport News. To the extent they are able to perform my sense is they are going to be able to hit our in service states and everybody is going to be happy with the ultimate outcome that\u2019s where we believe we are right now. Andy Levi - Avon Capital :  Just kind of the dollars involved and whose going to eat those dollars and CVI doesn't have as much flexibility, obviously, as Westinghouse or Southern Company or people within your group. Tom Fanning :  Andy I think we need to. You know I am not going to go there. Andy Levi - Avon Capital :  No, I understand. It\u2019s interesting to see how it ultimately goes out. Okay thank you very much. I will see you soon. Operator :  And our last registered question at this time with Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : First, I just have a clarification on what you said a little bit ago about Kemper. I think you mentioned July 2015 is when you're looking for syngas to go to the gasifiers, is that what I heard? Tom Fanning :  That\u2019s the good general date I would get that precise but yeah. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : So is that the same as first syngas production that you were talking about on your slide from last quarters? Tom Fanning :  Yes. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay, then I also had a couple clarification questions on your Vogtle construction update on page 5 of the presentation. I'm just trying to get a sense of timing of when you know, for the near-term items and those you expect to occur in 4Q? What's the timing kind of related to the cooling tower? Then for Unit 4 for the MCD65 is that before year-end or how should we think about that? Tom Fanning :  Dan I think the CA1 module is first quarter next year. We should complete the cooling tower in the fourth quarter of this year. And then as far as Unit 4 we certainly should do in the fourth quarter offsetting CA04 and CD65. I think that\u2019s where we are. Tom Fanning :  Yeah the way I would read that is near-term is kind of year-end. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then on the horizon is early next year? Tom Fanning :  Yes. Tom Fanning : Operator anymore questions? Operator : At this time there are no further questions. Sir are there any closing remarks. Tom Fanning : Yes sir. Thank you all for being on the call. Thank you for being loyal shareholders. I am disappointed with our schedule and cost performance. We are just rigorously directed and improved our performance there I think we put a methodical schedule that we can hit. I\u2019m going to put intense focus and make sure that we do adjust as well as we can. The project team there understands the intensity of my focus. Other than Kemper, I would say that the franchise is operating just as well as it ever has when you look at customer service, you look at reliability, you look at safety, you look at just kind of how we\u2019re delivering value to the communities we\u2019re privileged to serve this company has never been better. Thank you for being with us and we look forward to chatting with you in Dallas in the weeks ahead. Operator :  Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the Southern Company third quarter 2014 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir. Daniel Tucker : Thank you, Rebecca. Welcome everyone to Southern Company's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call. To follow along during the call you can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com. We have a full agenda for today's call. We will begin with a brief recap of 2014 operational highlights, followed by an update on the Kemper and Vogtle projects. We will then discuss fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results and sales results, and finally we will provide earnings guidance for 2015. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas Fanning : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that Southern Company's franchise operations have never performed better than they did in 2014. In 2014, we continue to provide the best customer service in the business. In fact, Southern Company and its four traditional operating companies occupied the top five spots for all customer classes combined in the customer value benchmark survey, our annual peer comparison of United States electric utilities. This marks the 11th time in the past 13 years that Southern Company has ranked in the top cortile for all customer classes in that survey. And earlier this month, those of our traditional operating companies that were rated in the J.D. Power & Associates survey, all ranked either first or second in their respective categories. Alabama Power was also named the most-trusted residential electric utility in America by Lifestory Research, an independent consumer market research firm. In terms of system reliability, we have continued to set and raise the bar. Our 2014 peak season EFOR of 1.9% was particularly exceptional compared to the most recent five-year national average of around 9%. And our transmission and distribution businesses performed superbly, setting all-time system records for frequency and duration of transmission outages as well as an all-time system record for distribution outage frequency. Meanwhile, we achieved our second best year ever in the duration of distribution outages. We also continue to grow our wholesale renewable portfolio through our Southern Power subsidiary, which added three new solar facilities in 2014. The 20 megawatt Adobe facility in California, the 50 megawatt Macho Springs facility in New Mexico and the 150 megawatt Solar Gen 2 facility in California. Southern Power also had a 131 megawatt solar plant under development in Georgia that is expected to begin operation in late 2016. With completion of this facility, Southern Power is expected to own more than 460 megawatts of solar capacity, and is clearly becoming an industry leader in the advancement and operation of this important technology. In these areas and many others, Southern Company's franchise business continues to lead the way, strengthening existing operations and seeking new opportunities to expand our reach, all for the benefit of the customers and communities we serve. Let's now discuss our two large construction project, beginning with plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As you can see from the site photo, we have included in our slide deck, progress continues on Vogtle 3 and 4, including completion of the 601 foot Unit 3 cooling tower in December. Our focus continues to be on quality and safety for the entire project with the two nuclear islands, as our critical path going forward. Major concrete work is progressing on both units, as we prepare for key module placements later this year. For Unit 3, we are working towards installation of the CA01 module inside the containment vessel this spring and the first shield building panel this summer. For Unit 4, we are working towards installation of the CA04 module in the containment vessel and assembly of the CA20 auxiliary building. Vogtle 3 and 4 remain a valuable investment for customer. Considering all of the $2.3 billion in projected customer benefits, including production tax credits, DOE loan guarantees and CBI pay-in rates, in addition to the benefits of low cost nuclear fuel, we expect the net rate effect on Georgia Power customers to be approximately 6.8%. Recall that when the Georgia Public Service Commission initially approved the project in 2009, base rates were expected to increase 12%. L.A. last week, we disclosed the receipt of a revised forecast for completion from our contractors that reflects an 18-month delay from the previous estimated in-service days. The process of reviewing the revised forecast for completion, the drivers for change and possible mitigation opportunities continues. We have not agreed to any change to the guaranteed substantial completion dates, nor do we believe that all efforts to mitigate the contractor delays have been made. Based on our review thus far and considering the fixed and firm nature of our EPC contract, we believe the contractors are responsible for their costs associated with the delay and any costs to mitigate. We will still be responsible for our share of the owners cost. For example, cost associated with oversight and operational readiness, which we estimate to be approximately $10 million per month. We will also continue to incur financing cost of approximately $30 million per month. Our contract also provides for liquidated damages for each day the two units are late, and this stipulation should help mitigate the cost of any delay. Largely because of the protections provided in our EPC contract, even if one assumes the entire 18-month contractor delay, the rate impact to customers is minimal and were made solidly inside our earlier projection of 6% to 8%. We will continue our review process and plan to file our 12th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report with the Georgia Public Service Commission on February 27. Now, let's turn to an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. As we shared with you in October, we are moving down three parallel path towards first syngas production in the third quarter of this year. I'm pleased to report that all three paths, operational training, control systems validation and start-up and check-out activities are underway and progressing well. Steam blows and a series of low pressure tests were completed in late 2014. The first quarter of this year will include critical airflow tests as well as first fire of the gasifier this spring. During the same timeframe, we will be testing and tuning our Lignite delivery system. The combined cycle at Kemper project also continues to perform very well. We expect the fine tuning we've enabled to do while operating the unit on natural gas will benefit the project greatly during the final integration with the gasifier. With construction largely behind us and in recognition of the critical startup and operational activities ahead, in early December we augmented our existing team by adding a new Site Vice President, Chip Troxclair. Chip brings over 30 years of industry experience to the project, primarily in the startup and operation of gasification plants. Chip's extensive background combined with existing expertise, already on site, will help us navigate the startup process all the way through the operation of the facility. Turing to the regulatory front, we continue to have constructive discussions with the PSE staff in Mississippi. As is our usual approach, we prefer to let those discussions conclude, before we share any details. I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic review. Arthur Beattie : Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the fourth quarter 2014 as well as for the full year 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we earned $0.33 per share compared to $0.47 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we earned $2.21 per share compared to $1.88 per share in 2013. Our results for the fourth quarter 2014 include after-tax charges of $43 million or $0.05 per share. And the earnings for the full year 2014 include after-tax charges totaling $536 million or $0.59 per share related to increased cost estimates for construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County integrated gasification combined cycle project. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 include after-tax charges of $25 million or $0.03 per share. And earnings for the full year 2013 include after-tax charges totaling $729 million or $0.83 per share related to increased cost estimates for construction of the Kemper project. As a reminder, Mississippi will not seek recovery of estimated cost to complete the facility above the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of Department of Energy grants and exceptions to the cost cap. Results for the full year 2013 also include an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leverage lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2013 also include $12 million or $0.02 per share of insurance recovery related to the March 2009 litigation settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC. Excluding these items, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were $0.38 and $2.80 per share, respectively, compared with $0.48 and $2.71 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2013. Earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were positively influenced by retail revenue effect at Southern Company's traditional operating companies, offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses. Full year 2014 earnings were further positively influenced by closer-to-normal weather and increased customer growth compared with the full year 2013. Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2014. As expected, economic growth in 2014 was modest, but after experiencing weakness during the first quarter, the company expanded strongly throughout the remainder of the year. This expansion was led by manufacturing output, increased exports and a stronger domestic economy. Total weather adjusted retail sales grew 0.9% in 2014 led by industrial sales, which were up 2.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.3% for the year. We have now enjoyed seven consecutive quarters of positive year-over-year industrial sales growth in our region. We experienced growth across all major industrial segments, with sales now at pre-recession levels. The strongest segments include primary metals up 8% and transportation up 6%. Housing-related industries continue to improve with both lumbar and stone, clay and glass up 5%. Weather adjusted residential sales were essentially flat for 2014. Customer gains in the first quarter of 2014 were interrupted due to extreme weather, but began recovering in the second quarter. In fact, we added more than 31,500 new residential customers in 2014, 15% ahead of 2013, and saw the issuance of 57,000 residential building permits or 6% more than in 2013. Personal income, meanwhile, grew at 2% in 2014 compared with flat growth in 2013, but a higher share of multi-family customer gains continues to challenge use per customer growth. Weather adjusted commercial sales were down 0.4% for the year and continue to be challenged by high office and retail vacancy rates. In Atlanta, for example, vacancy rates were 18% versus a national average of 17%. On the bright side, however, employment growth continues to absorb excess office and retail space in Atlanta, which is ranked number 10 nationally in overall office market activity and number one in hotel occupancy rates. Meanwhile, our economic development pipeline remains robust with more than 300 projects, representing 43,000 potential jobs and over $29 billion dollars in potential capital investment. Major announcements in the fourth quarter of 2014 included the decision by Mercedes Benz to relocate its U.S. headquarters to Metro Atlanta, a move that will add some 800 jobs to the local economy. General Motors' decision to locate a technology development center in Metro Atlanta creating 400 jobs and plans by Unisys for a research and development center in Augusta, which will create some 700 jobs. In addition, H\u00e4ring, a manufacturer of precision automotive components will locate a production facility in Hartwell, Georgia creating an additional 800 jobs. Looking ahead to 2015, industrial sales are expected to lead the way with growth of 1.7% continuing the momentum of the last seven quarters. Some of our industrial customers could be positively impacted or affected by lower oil prices, while others could be negatively affected by an increase in the value of the dollar and a slowing global economy. Elsewhere, we anticipate continued residential growth of around 1% and commercial sales grow of approximately 1.4%. The primary driver of residential sales growth should be continued strengthening of residential customer growth and a continued recovery of the economy. The strengthening of personal income growth. Both residential and commercial sales should benefit from lower oil prices, which some have characterized as a $700 per car oil dividend. As noted earlier, the Atlanta office market is one of the most active in the U.S. with vacancy rates dropping throughout 2014. In 2015, we expect to add more than 1 million square feet of office and retail space to be added in just three new Atlanta area mixed use developments, Ponce City market, Avalon and Buckhead Atlanta. These new commercial projects are expected to absorb the majority of their new space during 2015 and should therefore contribute to increased energy sales this year. As a final note, we reengaged earlier this month with our economic roundtable group of regional economist and executives from several of our largest customers that meets twice a year. The panel has indicated that they expect GDP growth of approximately 3% in 2015, consistent with our own expectation, but we're cautious about the potential impact of a stronger dollar in the short-term and higher oil prices later in the year. The group agrees with our expectation, that industrial activity will continue to improve, but believes that growth will be more restrained than in 2014 and that U.S. housing markets will continue on an upward trend. Meanwhile, the group expects the global economy to remain sluggish. In addition to our new sales forecast, we have included an updated capital expenditure forecast and financing plan in our slide deck. Our CapEx forecast totals $16.6 billion for the three-year period, 2015 to 2017. With environmental compliance CapEx for MATS wrapping up in 2015 and early 2016 and Kemper CapEx concluding in early 2016, the CapEx for our traditional operating companies is projected to decline from $5.4 billion in 2015 to $4.2 billion and $3.9 billion in 2016 and 2017, respectively. As we highlighted during our call in October, and as Tom reiterated earlier in this call, Southern Power had tremendous success finding new renewable projects in 2014. The 2015 and 2016 base CapEx forecast for Southern Power include the projected investments for several of these projects. As we look ahead, Southern Power continues to pursue additional renewables projects that meet our investment criteria. To account for these new potential investments, we have designated $1.9 billion as a placeholder CapEx for 2015 to 2017. Since the 30% investment tax credit will be reduced to 10% after 2016, most of the placeholder dollars are allocated 2015 and 2016. Our external financing plan reflects zero equity needs for 2015 to 2017. Our forecast assumes more than $1.8 billion in additional draws over the three-year period on our DOE loan guarantees for plant Vogtle 3 and 4. And I would like to note that we have been very pleased with the success of this financing program. The financing savings we have captured through our draws to date have exceeded our projection, further increasing the benefits that we have gained for customers since certification of the project. Moving now to EPS, our earnings per share outlook. Our earnings per share guidance for 2015 is $2.76 to $2.88 per share. We have slightly widened the range for 2015, particularly to address to account for potential variability in Southern Power's earning. As I discussed earlier, our plans assume that Southern Power will continue its efforts to find renewable projects that meet our investment criteria. The middle of our guidance range assumes that Southern Power is able to invest all of the placeholder CapEx that we have included in our forecast. The size of the range recognizes that we may find fewer or more projects than we are currently forecasting. It is also intended to capture the potential for projects to slip out of 2015 and into 2016, which would shift the ITC benefits accordingly. Of course, our guidance range also accounts for the normal variability we have historically seen in our traditional operating companies as well as Southern Power, including normal variations in weather, the economy, and wholesale energy prices. As has been our practice for many years, we have considered much of this potential variability in developing our flexible O&M spending plan. Going forward our long-term EPS growth outlook is still in the 3% to 4% range. In addition, our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2015 is $0.55 per share. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas Fanning : Thanks, Art. After a successful year in 2014, Southern Company is entering the New Year with a strong sense of momentum. We see a franchise business that is operating better than ever, solidifying its position as an industry-leader in all phases of the business. We see important progress on major capital project and a continued commitment to resolving challenges in a manner that is consistent with our customer-focused business model. And we see a strengthening economy and a region poised to grow in the months and years ahead. In short, we believe Southern Company is well-positioned to succeed in the year ahead, behind the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and communities we're proud to serve. We are now ready to take your questions. So operator, we'll now take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : So couple questions. When I look at the guidance range for this year, it's like $0.03 lower on the high-end and maybe $0.04, $0.05 lower on the low-end than the aspiration you had in the last year's fourth quarter earnings call. Those aren't big numbers, but can you give us a sense of what the drivers were, that caused the range to come down slightly year-over-year? Arthur Beattie : Yes, Greg, you're right. It's a little overweight. We are where we were with some minor tweaks. We've had some cropping of the top-end due to a couple things; additional bonus depreciation that we have not factored in the last year's numbers, and we issued slightly more equity than we had communicated last year. Most of that being due to stock option exercises, primarily in the fourth quarter. So instead of raising $600 million of new equity, we raised $800 million of new equity. So we've got more shares outstanding. And those two things will crop the top-end a little bit. The bottom-end really is, as I've said in the script, mostly related to performance variability around Southern Power. If we didn't get any of those price holder investments, than that's where we'd be at the bottom. Thomas Fanning : And timing of those as well. Greg Gordon : Two more questions. Second question when I look at Southern Power on Page 8 of your earnings release; you gave the quarter ending and year ending net income by segment and Southern Power did a $172 million in '14. Is it your expectation that at the midpoint of guidance you'd be at around the same number, the high-end, the low-end or are you higher or lower than that. Arthur Beattie : It might be in and around that, maybe a little more that that. But it would require that we do something similar that we did last year in the terms of our Solar acquisition. Thomas Fanning : Yes, Greg, that number at midpoint is $180 million. Greg Gordon : And that assumes you deployed the amount of capital you just articulated? Thomas Fanning : That's right. But as Art said, it's highly dependent on how much and when, and all that, it's a little lumpy. Greg Gordon : Final question. Can you give us a sense of, I understand your legal and financial position with regards to your relationship with your constructor at Vogtle, what are the next series of milestones that we need to be mindful of to see how this interaction evolves? Have you worked with them to get the performance that you want, and they in turn pushback against you on what they deem to be their perspective on the costs? Thomas Fanning : Just recently we were given a 10,000 page document that speaks to an intergraded project scheduled, and so the very first steps are to kind of wait through all of that detail and to really kind of turn data into information. We need to work with the contractors to understand the assumptions underlying that new schedule that they have provided. Even from the outset we believe that they have not taken, and this is in the words I've been using consistently, this is like an unmitigated schedule. And that we believe there is lots of things that they could do to improve it. Weighing against that are the facts that, and this has been disclosed thoroughly on VCM 11, that they just have continued issues with respect to engineering and construction and we look forward to their effort to resolve those issues. If you want to something describe those issues, it's the VCM 11 process. It's exceedingly open process. The independent monitor, Dr. Jacob testified that length in VCM 11, so you can get all the information you want to get. I think it's very clear that the contractors have just had continued difficulties. We say all along that you will always challenges and the issue is how successful you are, is determined by how well you resolve the challenges. We are working with the contractors to resolve their challenges. Complicating all of these issues is the fact that we believe there are financial disputes among and between Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge & Iron. And we think that's having an impact on the schedule that they have delivered to us, so it's really going through all of that. We are very comforted by the fact that we are committed to building a quality plan, a safe plan, and we are also very much comforted by the fact that for the additional costs, even if you believe it's going to be 18-month delay, which we dispute that the rate increases to customers remain within the 6% to 8% level, not the 12% that was originally contemplated. And we believe that for our additional cost, there are liquidate damages to help offset those costs. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Eggers. Dan Eggers : Just on the CapEx plans. If you compare last year's CapEx plans to this year's CapEx plan, obviously they all have this backward shape that you've shifted it out a year from what you had last year. What do you see is the ability to fill in kind of '16 and '17 to maybe stabilize that CapEx plan looking out or are we going to have wait until further in the decade to see that happen? Arthur Beattie : What we've got in there now are placeholders from Southern Power. Obviously, we could do more. We've got the tax appetite to do a little more than what we've outlined there. But we are still incubating other opportunities around the things that we talked about last year, be it expansion of our ability to take advantage of additional rate-based items and our investment in pipes and other things, but we are not in a position to work to talk about that yet. But in addition to that we've got opportunities possibly on the environmental side, which aren't fully vetted yet. Tom? Thomas Fanning : Well, what I would add is this kind of spectrum I've chatted about here on the stump really since the Dallas Financial Conference and then again in South Florida. We kind of have this spectrum of opportunity, Dan, of kind of at a minimum buying back our own shares. We've talked about how, for the amount of business risk we see we maybe equity over capitalized. On the other hand, given the kind of high market-to-book PE ratios, however, you want to describe it, maybe it's more attractive to buy somebody else's shares. But as we've talked in the past that's always been a very challenging proposition for us across. We have a big EVA shop, we believe that we would have to be reasonably clear about a way to earn a return on and return up the premium associated with any sort of activity there. And I think in the middle is kind of where we've tipped our hand as to our sweet spot, and that is buying other assets. Certainly, that's what we did in '14. So look for us to be active, creative and aggressive in looking for opportunities. Dan Eggers : Now, you spent a lot of money on assets this year successfully or in the process, but it didn't really change the growth rate with the deployment of capital. Is that reflective of the fact you're seeing some pressure on the returns you're getting on those projects or is it other things mitigating some of that upward inflation you would have expected on growth? Thomas Fanning : We've always been reasonably conservative in terms of setting our IRR curves for the kind of risks and projects we see. One of the things we mentioned back in October that we thought was emerging in the market remains true and that is we do have compared to a lot of people scale and a robust tax appetite. And therefore, we look like a pretty good customer, pretty good partner in these deals. So my sense is we're still going to see those opportunities. It's not causing us to drop our IRRs in any respect, we're able to maintain those to our satisfaction. Dan Eggers : And I guess one last question on loan growth. Your expectations in residential and commercial show your positive year-on-year comps, after this year not really showing those gains. What do you think will be the biggest factors to convert that from flat to growth this year? Arthur Beattie : We are looking at a lot of strong employment growth. I think we've seen that across the board, especially in the Southeast we've actually outstrip the U.S. growth rate and employment. And our manufacturing employment is also stronger than the U.S. As the economy continues to improve, as consumers consume the benefit of this oil dividend that we mentioned in our script, we think household income is also going to be helped by the portion of that household income that's disposable. That will translate, we think, into more commercial sales and hopefully will translate into more household formations, which I believe jumped pretty strongly in the fourth quarter nationally. We saw a pretty strong customer growth in our fourth quarter period as well, about 10,000 new customers on the residential side. So there is a number of elements there that we're looking at. I mentioned on the commercial end, we've got a lot of new projects coming in and around Atlanta. There are really three areas of Atlanta that are trending towards real strong growth. One is around the Perimeter, and that is where Mercedes is going to more than likely announce their headquarters. And that's a really strong market for new office complexes. There is a midtown development in and around Georgia Tech, which is mostly office related, but it has been real strong as of late, as new companies have announced citing of that to take advantage of the technology development out of Georgia Tech. And then most recently as Porsche moved their headquarters down near the airport. And that is a longer term development opportunity. But they're looking at expanding office space, Class A hotel space and other residential opportunities in and around that particular area. So there are number of things that we point to. Some will affect 2015 directly, some will be later, but those are real strong indicators to us that we are going to see a turnaround in commercial and residential growth per customers. Thomas Fanning : Dan, let me do a quick deconstruction on the household income statement. When you look at the revenue part of a household, its wages, and while we have seen some pressure there from a variety of factors, people withdrawing from the work force or people moving from fulltime to part time or whatever full time jobs they have, a disproportionate share going to service kind of industries. We still see pressure on the revenue side, but on the cost side, the expense side, if you will, the household as Art mentioned, I think energy prices, low gas prices have really helped. So the net consequences, net income may go up, and we believe its either going to be through increased saving, in other words retiring household debt, which is a good thing, it makes the economy more resilient or more consumption. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Just first quick question, just where did 2014 CapEx come in at? Arthur Beattie : Hold on a second, Steve, let me get that in front of me. We were very close. I think we've slightly under-spent the totals that we had, but it won't be around in the way of differed. Steven Fleishman : I guess the reason I ask is it's a bit of the same question, but from what I can tell just going back to last year your 2015 CapEx is up $1.4 billion from a year ago for '15 projection. 2016 looks like it's up a $1 billion, but it's the same growth rate, and if not even a little bit of a lower 2015 base. So again, just to clarify, the bonus depreciation, I guess is a piece of that. Maybe you could quantify how much of that might be impacting the rate base. Arthur Beattie : And Steve, you're right. The delta there is Southern Power. That's kind of what we're looking at. Remember, what we did in '14 was essentially put almost a three year CapEx allocation into one year. And that was kind of low $1 billion kind of allocation number. We're moving that number up to around $2.5 billion. So that's kind of what we're doing on CapEx. The delta it's mostly with Southern Power. Thomas Fanning : Yes, Steve, if you look at the traditional operating companies, we were within $20 million in total of what we budgeted for the year. If you throw Southern Power in, we actually spent $310 million more than we had forecast from a CapEx perspective. Steven Fleishman : And just a separate question on the Vogtle information. I know you disclosed expected monthly owner's cost for delay, but did you get any update from the consortium in terms of what the expected total construction cost of the plant will be? Thomas Fanning : No. Steven Fleishman : And is there any way based on the issues that they've mentioned in the saying to kind of estimate that? Thomas Fanning : Well, just remember, Steve, we are still going through the details of the latest integrated schedule. So we really don't know what's involved and what their assumptions are and everything else. Its 10,000 pages, so we got to go through that. And mean what we really need to know I think it is our belief and we received assertions from the executive management of the contractors throughout 2014. And in fact, the schedule could be short. So we need to understand what their position is. We need to understand what's required. Our contract is very clear, that it is the obligation of the contractor to undertake all methods necessary to meet the schedule requirement in the contract. That means adding new shifts, adding more people, staying overtime. Typical things you would expect to see on any construction undertaking. So I won't know the answer to your question, until we kind of sort through all those issues. We're working as hard as we can to do that right now. You should look to the VCM 12 is probably a more instructive kind of position for us to be in. We'll file that February 27. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : So just picking up on Steve's questioning. Just curious, you've said here today that the liquidated damages should help to mitigate the impact of your cost, which I imagine means the $40 million a month number you referenced. So is it a safe assumption that the per-diem amount adds up to a little less than $40 million a month or have you disclosed that at any point? Thomas Fanning : We had not, but we've gotten a lot of questions about it. And we've informed our partners that we probably needed to disclose what we think the amount is. So here we go. There is a lot of factors that I'm going to give you subject to, but essentially if you evaluate kind of the maximum amount of liquidated damages assuming the full 18 months delays, again subject to a lot of factors, we believe that Georgia Power's share would be about $240 million. Jonathan Arnold : So what about, you say 18 months delay, but does the LDs kick in April of next year, pending your current litigation. Thomas Fanning : Yes, right, they would kick in as of the guaranteed substantial completion date, which is a term in the contract of April '16 and April '17. Jonathan Arnold : So that $240 million number you've just given for Georgia Power share is that more than 18 months? Is that kind of from April '15 to '17, so it's more like a three year? Thomas Fanning : That's right. You got it. There is a limit. We aren't anywhere close to it right now, so I just want to give you that. To the extent there is other issues, there could be more liquidated damages. Jonathan Arnold : So what is the math behind that $240 million? Is it a daily amount or is it -- Thomas Fanning : That's what it is. It's a daily amount, and you can back into that if you want to. Jonathan Arnold : And the limit is $240 million? Thomas Fanning : No, the limit is way in excess. Jonathan Arnold : So there's a longer delay effectively that would come into play. Thomas Fanning : That's right. Jonathan Arnold : And then just you mentioned a couple of times that you would remain within the 6% to 8% range on customer rate impact. Thomas Fanning : Yes. Jonathan Arnold : What are you assuming in now that you've faced the incremental cost you've talked about, less this $240 million something like that? Thomas Fanning : That's right. Jonathan Arnold : And what's the rule of thumb? Is there any rule of thumb you can give us of what would push you above that range? Thomas Fanning : We think we're still way short of exceeding that range. We've talked a lot about estimates and all. We are more near than middle of the range than we are at the top, let me say it that way. And we think we've got lots of range, to stay within that range that we've been discussing. Jonathan Arnold : And just one final housekeeping thing. There was a big downtick in depreciation in the fourth quarter. It was 424 million and has been 500-ish a quarter. Was there something unusual happened there? Arthur Beattie : Yes, Jonathan, there was. Alabama Power had been deferring some O&M cost under a previous commission accounting order. And they filed a new depreciation study with the commission last year. And they found out they had available some cost of removal elements of the depreciation that they could offset these other deferred cost with. And so there was an entry made in the fourth quarter of last year at Alabama, which actually increased non-fuel O&M and decreased depreciation. And so it had a nil effect on income, but that's why you see the deltas in those particular line items. Jonathan Arnold : On the subject of non-fuel O&M, as you talk about your 2015 guidance is what's a sensible run rate, given you've had obviously some noise in the numbers this year? Arthur Beattie : We got back to what I would call a more normal element this year. So I would take the 2014 number and grow it by 3% to 3.5%. About 1% of that will be environmental and the remainder would be just normal company operation. Thomas Fanning : John, let me just add a little more line up on that. The reason we're able to keep the 6% to 8% range in place is because of all the benefits that we've added on this $2.3 billion. We mentioned in the course I think of the opening comments that we've been very happy with our ability to finance under the DOE loan guarantee. And in fact, we're exceeding where we thought we'd be on our estimates on that. I think we did a drawn in December, $200 million, for about 3%, and the average life was 22 years or something like that. So it's been a terrific vehicle for us and actually performing better than what we thought of. That $2.3 billion looks awfully good. Jonathan Arnold : Does that include the 800 of PTCs, correct? Thomas Fanning : That's right. Jonathan Arnold : Would you have any recourse against the contractor, if sort of further delay sort of push those off the table? Thomas Fanning : I don't know, John. And here is my view, I frankly think, my opinion, the contractor has given us, we believe, is an unmitigated schedule. We think there is flexibility to improve the schedule. It doesn't take into accounts. The comparative good progress, the date of our plan, I think we still have a descent amount of room before we're exposed to losing any of the PTCs for Unit 4. Unit 3 we're still very well protected. Jonathan Arnold : But if you did, would you have recourse to that? Thomas Fanning : I don't know. I don't think so, but that's to be decided by a lawyer I guess. You can claim anything in a lawsuit. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul Ridzon : Where are you assuming with regards to stock options in your '15 guidance? Thomas Fanning : Paul, we got no assumption for additional equity in 2015, 2016 or 2017, to the degree we have stock option exercises. We have plans to put in place a repurchase program that would to the degree we have proceeds to reduce those back down to as close to the zero level as possible. Paul Ridzon : And I guess, given that you're already $200 million ahead based on last year? Thomas Fanning : Based on last year, but that's where we're holding it, right. And we'll obviously see some more this year, but that's our plan to address. Paul Ridzon : And then what have you achieved and what remains to be done or to qualify for the full DOE benefits or tax benefits at Kemper? Thomas Fanning : We have filed for those -- at Kemper, I'm sorry. I was thinking Vogtle. I'm sorry. You're talking about investment tax credits? Paul Ridzon : Yes. Thomas Fanning : You're talking about phase 2 investment tax credits that would relate to our carbon capture percentages. We have to have it in service by April of '16 to qualify for those. So right now, our schedule would meet that requirement. And there would have to be 65% or proof of 65% of carbon capture for all the gas that was produced, the syngas that's produced. Arthur Beattie : And that is our target. Thomas Fanning : Yes. Paul Ridzon : That's the only hurdle? Thomas Fanning : Yes. It's a deadline and an amount removed. Paul Ridzon : And then the 200 over, where you're on the options, are you going to use that to buy stock in '15? Thomas Fanning : At this point, we're just going to see what kind of activity we get. We'll make whatever adjustments we think are necessary. The idea going forward is no new equity issuances. Arthur Beattie : That's correct. We ended up the year with a common equity ratio of about 43.5%, and so that's still within our marginal planning. We don't plan on going north of that, but again we'll just see what we get and we'll take out as Tom described as much of what we raise as possible. Paul Ridzon : What was your yearend share count? Arthur Beattie : I'm sorry. Thomas Fanning : The yearend share count. Arthur Beattie : Just over 900 million shares. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : I have one or two Vogtle questions and then some housekeeping ones. When you go back and read the Vogtle testimony, some of the interveners, not the public staff, are kind waving the flag of prudency, meaning, or imprudency. Just curious for any comments you have in that regard, whether they really have a leg to stand on by making that type of argument? What is the requirement in Georgia for something to be for a prudency disallowance or prudency review of Vogtle? Can you kind of just go through that from a regulatory construct please? Thomas Fanning : Yes, sure. We don't think there has been any credible testimony that suggests there is anything imprudent in the project to date. When you think about kind of the brick and mortar cost to the plant, as provided by the contractors, where -- I forgot the last number, I think it was 0.5%. I mean it's right on the money. In terms of our own oversight cost, this is kind of a $10 million per month that we see. It's absolutely prudent for us to have oversight, because we are absolutely committed to providing the highest quality safest project possible. Recall also, part of those cost are tax issues and insurance and some other thing. I just don't see very many legs at all for any imprudence evaluations of that. Michael Lapides : And just some housekeeping items. How much bonus depreciation cash flow benefits you expect in 2015? And which of your segments rate bases will that have the greatest impact on? Arthur Beattie : Mike, let's see, that's $625 million that would impact 2015, and maybe $125 million to $140 million in '15 that would impact '16, and it's mostly in the regulated OpCos, but I don't have a split for you. Thomas Fanning : We can certainly get back to you later, if you want. Michael Lapides : Or just kind of pro rated across the subs based on size and scale somehow? Thomas Fanning : I mean that would be reasonable. Michael Lapides : And Art, the comment, you answered an earlier question about Alabama and what happened to D&A in the fourth quarter. When we think about going forward, is that the new run rate kind of what we saw in the base kind of a lower new base of what we saw in the fourth quarter of '14 or is that more kind of the run rate of what we saw in prior quarters and the fourth quarter '14 was a one-off? Arthur Beattie : I think the prior quarters would be the better run rate number to go with. But when you think about non-fuel O&M in that regard, most of those deferred cost were deferred in 2014. So I would leave those in the base for non-fuel O&M. Michael Lapides : Meaning, grow O&M by 2% a year like you commented, but also ensure the D&A is kind of looking at the first nine months kind of run rate-ish? Arthur Beattie : Yes, exactly. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : I just wanted to talk about growth in terms of gas demand and as you think about supplying your customers. As you think about your growth profile are there some moving parts that could cause you to want to be more aggressive in terms of growth in gas infrastructure investment. How are you all thinking about that these days? Thomas Fanning : Really interesting stuff there. If you dial back to 2014, remember we have switched a lot away from coal to natural gas. And one of the things that we always warn people was that gas was more volatile and there were certain risks around it. It was not a panacea. What we saw in the year 2014 was that we generated about the same amount of energy with coal as we did gas, about 40% each. Why was that? Because we had the fuel flexibility during polar vortex one and two to switch off spiking gas and be able to run our much cheaper coal fleet. In fact, over the year we saved about $125 million of fuel savings, because we had that flexibility. So let's keep in mind what's trying to happen in regulatory space in terms of shutting down coal in America. Now, interestingly in the fourth quarter, we flipped that with very cheap gas prices. We ran the numbers; gas generation went up to about 49%; coal flipped back to about 31%. So going forward, what do we expect? The budget for 2015 would show gas at 44% and coal at 36%. So we'll see. Now, how does that impact kind of our appetite for gas infrastructure? I had mentioned to you all before that we could see ourselves getting involved in gas pipelines now, because gas is much more kind of synergistic with the rest of our business, as opposed to say where we were five, six, seven years ago. One of the things we find is that there are lots of price disparities of gas transportation, say, from the east to west side of our system. We've been able to evaluate a lot of opportunities. We're seeking those out aggressively. And I think the kind of notion would be that we would in fact be an anchor tenant to whatever we invest in. So we are working very hard to make those things come real we'll see. Stephen Byrd : So it sounds like just given the kind of commodity environment we're in though, that certainly more gas supply and becoming an anchor tenant certainly very high in your list of things you're interested in doing? Thomas Fanning : Sure it is. And we're going to be disciplined in how we invest. And I'll tell you something else, here again commenting on 111(d) to the extent that we've got to add more gas units in the future, we need more infrastructure. We are pretty well filled up right now in terms of FT, which is how we cover all of our units. So we need a competitive supply of gas, we need more infrastructure and we can participate in that. Stephen Byrd : And that will be effectively additive to the kind of spending that you all are thinking about currently? Thomas Fanning : That's correct. Stephen Byrd : And then just quickly on nuclear. Just curious as you watched the progress in China, especially at the Sanmen project, anything to report there or is it sort of just moving along as planned? Thomas Fanning : I think it's moving along. They're resolving the valve issue there. So I think it will not have a complete impact on kind of where we are. So when you think about the reactor coolant pumps, there have been some design issues that have manifested themselves in China. We think those are getting dealt with satisfactorily. We don't think that they will impact our critical paths. At another way, we're benefiting from not being the alpha plant here and we're learning from our Chinese experience. So we have people located in China. We follow those very closely. We've learned from them already. We're happy with where we are, at least from our China experience. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Brian Chin : Springboarding off of Stephen's question on gas infrastructure, we've seen a little bit more color on how alternative capitalization structures trade. Just what are your latest thoughts on if you were to go into that route? Would that be considered more part of your regulated utility operations? Would you consider alternate capitalization structures for those? Just a little bit of updated thoughts there? Arthur Beattie : So you guys have heard the old saying that -- I believe in the long run view of finance, there's lots of tricks, but there is no magic. If there is a structure that makes sense, then we'll certainly consider it. We've never been of a fan of yieldcos. We think those are short-term positive, long-term troublesome. If it's an MLP, if there's a real tax advantage, we would certainly consider those things. But we believe that keeping a simple balance sheet and providing long-term value is really the right course of action for us, but we'll consider anything. Brian Chin : And then one last question from me. Could you just remind us again of the dividend policy and dividend outlook, given the revised change in CapEx spending and guidance? Arthur Beattie : Sure. Of course everything I say about dividends is subject to Board approval, that's their deal. But we've been on a $0.07 trajectory for sometime now. And we feel that having a regular, predictable, sustainable flow of earning per share that permits for a regular predictable and sustainable dividend policy is how you maximize value. If you look at our TSR over any kind of longest timeframe, you will see that the vast majority of TSR for us is driven by our dividend policy. So that remains foremost in our thinking about how to grow value for shareholders. So of course, I got to be subject to everything, but most importantly subject to final Board authority. But we feel very confident in our ability to deliver sustainable dividend policy as we have in the past into the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha : Tom or Art, just wanted to clarify the 3% to 4% growth rate in EPS that you showed us off this new 2015 base, was that specifically referring to 2016 over 2015 or was that a longer term growth rate? Thomas Fanning : Long term. It's kind of both, but it's long-term. What we see in our projections is that we're able to stay within that envelope pretty comfortably over a long timeframe. I got to give you all of the admonishments about things that are unknown and everything else, but for what we know right now, we can stay within that envelope for a long time. Ali Agha : And Tom, just correct me if I am wrong, but I thought previously, when you guys had originally given us '14 through '16 earnings guidance and then some longer-term outlook, I thought the plan was given the way the spending was working, the 3% to 4% was '14 through '16, and then you would accelerate beyond that, but I guess that's not the case. Thomas Fanning : No, no. Here is kind of where we are. We are kind of in the same spot. Let's think about the years ahead here and I don't want to give too much more color other than kind of the commentary we provided in the past, but if you look at kind of '15 to '16, things look pretty normal there. '16 to '17, you have the expiration for 30% investment tax credit, that could have some impact on your ability to impact earnings per share through investment tax credit investments associated with Solar. So that could have a shaping impact. And then beyond that we've always talked about really environmental CapEx and the start-up of new-generation CapEx, all of that remains the same, and that really shifts the nature of your curve. So what we said was when you consider the impact of 111(d), which depending on how the final rule looks could have a dramatic effect of the backend CapEx curve as well as Coal Ash and 316(b) and a variety of other things. We'll just have to see how those turn out, that's all what I have been talking about. Ali Agha : So think of this really '15 through '18 or that time period, and then in the late in the decade things change? Thomas Fanning : Well, certainly as we know more we'll adjust it. What you should take comfort in, as for what we know, we think this is a very comfortable envelope. Ali Agha : Separate question. Art, if I did my math right, it looked to me that your effective tax rate in '14 came in lower than previously thought. What was driving that? And how should we think of an effective tax rate for '15 and beyond? Arthur Beattie : Ali, are you talking about the cash tax rate or are you talking about the accounting book effective affected tax rate? Ali Agha : I'm talking about the book tax rate, Art, adjusting from Kemper charges and all of that. If you exclude all of that the book rate looked a little lower to me. Arthur Beattie : Well, I'm looking at over the last few years in total though. You could have had some effects from Southern Power and their investment tax credits, which was booked in the fourth quarter of this year. And then, you've got higher AFUDC as well, which is not taxable. Ali Agha : But your book tax rate doesn't change very much, your cash tax rate changes a lot, right. And for 2014, it looks like a little over 8% there. Arthur Beattie : Yes. Ali Agha : And then, Tom, as far as Kemper is concerned, I mean you had a position now with the latest round of charges to kind of say, hey, if the confidence is much higher then, hey, I think we've got it all now under control cost-wise or still too early to make that statement? Thomas Fanning : Yes, Ali, I've been burned in the past, haven't I? Look, we've got Chip Troxclair in place here and we've had very good conversations. In fact, I had the whole management council of Southern Company at Kemper about a week ago. And I think the team is working hard. And so yes, we've got a lot of confidence, especially in the schedule. We're doing I think a better job at managing kind of the want tos in terms of CapEx as opposed to the must haves in terms of CapEx as we finish start up. The one caveat I just have to throw out to you all that I have been consistent about from day one are the unknown, unknown. If you start the thing up something may happen that nobody thought about. We've added more inventory to insulate ourselves against risk for machines that don't work the way they're supposed to or just defective workmanship. The good news is, when I evaluate kind of the work we've done in pressurizing [ph] trains A and B, steam blows, welding inspection other things, we've done pretty well. We had some hiccups here recently in some of the pulverizers and some of the lignite drying equipment, but we've already provided for fixing those issues. We're working hard to stay within the estimates we've given you. So I'm as confident as I can be, there are things that could cause us trouble in the future. But I feel as good as I have been. Ali Agha : And my last question, Tom, when I look at the weather-normalized sales that you provide us and I looked at the four quarters of '14, this fourth quarter was the slowest over the 2014 period. Was there anything particularly that was causing this slowdown and which you don't thing will continue in '15? Or how would you explain that? Thomas Fanning : I don't get excited about quarter evaluation whenever I look at this stuff, because especially on weather normal adjustment, there's all sorts of variability. I tend to look at kind of longer-term, longer trends and see what's going on. The biggest issue I think facing kind of residential and commercial sales growth is this issue of, and its curses and blessings, industrial strength, during the downturn recall that a lot of our industrial customers retooled, put in technology, and in fact, we've been able to grow, but the efficiency of output has been terrific. Well, the good news is that's given us strength even against the weakening dollar, right. The bad news is we haven't added jobs as much as we thought we would, and therefore wages haven't grown. We think that we were starting to kind of take up that slack, and we're starting to see the signals as the things, Art, went through that in fact jobs will return, wages will increase and therefore spending will increase. Those are the longer-term trends we see. And don't just hang it on wages. Remember the information Art gave you about the household income statement and how the expense item largely for energy, thank goodness, are going down, people have more money in their pockets to spend. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Mark Barnett : So you talked a lot about kind of the bigger projects and what not, and I appreciate the new details. That's really helpful for us. Just wondering more maybe on the O&M trajectory that you've seen so far this year, would you say that I mean if the fourth quarter haven't seen the segment breakout yet. So would you say that you're seeing more of that in one particular OpCo or another? I mean for example, as a lot of that being driven out of Alabama? Thomas Fanning : Real quick. Here, again, as I was talking earlier about don't go off on one quarter about consumption. Don't go off in one quarter about O&M. Because we have this flexible O&M system we had in place for years now, which helps kind of attenuate our ultimate financial results. Arthur Beattie : But there is something, Mark, and I addressed it on an earlier question, was related to the Alabama entries that roughly bumped up non-fuel O&M by $100 million or so, more than what we expected in the year, but that occurred in the fourth quarter. So Alabama, if any of them, and as I said earlier, most of those were 2014 deferrals anyway, so they would have occurred throughout the year, had we not deferred them and then cleared them up in the year. Thomas Fanning : So what kind of a long-term O&M growth rate '14 to '15? Arthur Beattie : 3% to 3.5%. Thomas Fanning : 3% to 3.5%, that's a good trend. Mark Barnett : I know there can be some quarterly noise. I just wanted to clarify, because it sounded like it was probably related to those regulatory things. Just a second question, I guess, maybe another way of looking at some of the comments you've made already about the clean power plan. What kind of conversations have you started, particularly in Alabama and Georgia, about kind of handling compliance and handling the plans that would be necessary, should it survive in this current state or how to I guess approach proposals? Thomas Fanning : Look, Mark, thanks for kind of raising that. We haven't really talked about that. You know that we work in a real-time fashion with the folks in our states. We have a common purpose and that is to serve the customers and communities with clean, safer, liable, affordable power. And I know that certain initiatives out of EPA or elsewhere get high focus on certain issues, particularly 111(d) would be carbon. We have to balance those results. For the benefit of this, I don't think there can be more privilege to serve. When I think about where EPA is 111(d), we know and I think they know that they have a flawed proposed rule. And they've received, now I forget what the number is, over 4 million comments or something, it's unbelievable. But they're going to have to I think deal with some of the low hanging fruit, if you will, in the final rule. I am guessing, we do get a final rule some time in the summer time maybe call it August. And I think they will deal with some resolution on this kind of cliff 2020 date. I think they will also fix things like nuclear and particularly nuclear under construction. So look I think it's almost premature to comment kind of where we think they'll end up. We've had lots of opportunities to talk to them, so has everybody else, 32 states have come after them in terms of comments, attorney general, governors, public service commissions. I think there is a lot of ground to cover before we have a final rule. Let's see what the final rule looks like, and then the ball will be in the court of the states in order to implement their state implementation plan. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS. Julien DumoulinSmith : Well, it's Julien here. So I wanted to follow back up here quickly on Southern Power, going rewinding back to the start of the call there. The $180 million midpoint you talked about I think for '15, how much of the ITC benefit is baked in there? And by the way the kind of the second part of that question is really, you talked about the '16 to 17' exploration, what kind of an impact do you think that is in terms of a headwind, if you kind of lose those benefits for new projects? I know, it's a little detailed. Thomas Fanning : I'm going to guess that kind of the benefits from ITC, and don't get too precise on the $180 million, that planning estimate, it's very lumpy. But the specific question was, what's the assumption in the midpoint? It's $180 million. The contribution from ITC is probably over $40 million. So that's what you should think of. Julien DumoulinSmith : But then it probably falls off pretty materially in '16. So the roll off by '17 is -- Thomas Fanning : So '16 is probably okay. It will probably be a similar number, perhaps even more depending -- so you have a project that comes in, you think it's going to come in at December of '15, slides into '16. So it really is lumpy and dependent upon when you close these deals and when they go in service. So '17 you should kind of estimate that, as ITC drops from 30% to a 10% kind of number under current tax law then you should shave off some percentage. So let's say two-thirds of $40 million to $50 million number just in rough math, right. So that's the kind of math I would use, if I were you. That would be the earnings per share headwinds. And I'm talking specifically about solar right now. To the extent we invest in wind, it has a different profile. To the extent some of our CapEx is associated with gas pipeline that has a different profile. So I'm attaching all of that on solar. Julien DumoulinSmith : I was going to ask you, I mean, more holistically, what do you think about solar spend in general? I mean, the Southeast has seen a lot of projects, but we haven't heard much on you guys from Florida or Alabama. I mean, is there a potential there, I mean either via the utility themselves or via Southern Power? I mean is this something you could see more spend in '16 or is it tricky to see that happen, just given the timeline and the 30% ITC or et cetera? Thomas Fanning : I frankly would expect to see more of the solar outside the Southeast. There may be more opportunities. But when we originally got into solar, we really started looking at where the solar resources were the best, right. The Southeast tend to be kind of cloudy. It has high humidity. It's not the best area for solar, even though there has been a lot of movement in the state of Georgia. Recall, Georgia Power was voted the Investor-Owned Utility of the Year last year by the solar industry. So we're going to continue to look wherever I think the resources are best, where the contracts are the best. A particular area of emphasis for us also has been with the DoD, the Department of Defense. We've announced several base solar deals in Georgia and I think we've announced one in Gulf, and then we'll see about other bases elsewhere in the Southeast. So look for that. Julien DumoulinSmith : Now, let me turn my attention just a little differently here. The gas infrastructure that you alluded to earlier is that under Southern Power as well? And when we find out details about that, I mean I imagined that's probably tied to your talk earlier about carbon rules and finalization, and ultimately what kind of coal to gas switching we really are going to see in the Southeast, is that kind of a good way to think about it? Thomas Fanning : Julien, whatever you did to Michael is kind of what I'll have to say about gas pipelines. I don't want to reveal the nature of discussions on any gas pipelines at this point. But the specific question you asked about kind of would it be under Southern Power, I wouldn't be surprised that we put it in another sub besides Southern Power. That's really kind of a governance question. Julien DumoulinSmith : And then lastly, let's turn it back to Kemper quickly. You kind of alluded to potentially hashing out of deal in the state again. And I know you don't want to touch it too much, but what's the timeline there? Because I know we've talked about before having a deal and then it seems like that slid a little bit, just given the timeline of the project it slid. When could we see something come to resolution there, if you will, and what is it relate to specifically? Is this the first half prudency review that you guys are going to try to hash out? And again, I don't mean the pry too much. Thomas Fanning : Julien, what we've talked about in the past is kind of a grand settlement, where we've ramped to get all of the kind of issues that relate to Mississippi Power. And for host of reasons, I know you understand, we don't want to say too much about that. We would like to see those issues resolved sooner rather than later. So let's just leave it there, if we could. I appreciate your indulgence. And one other comment I just want to make, we talked about other subs, other subs could be OpCos for gas infrastructure. Julien DumoulinSmith : The utility OpCos? Thomas Fanning : Yes. Just depending on opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : I want to follow-up on a comment you made regarding the consortium and potential conflicts among the contractors, as to who is suppose to cover what. And I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on that? Thomas Fanning : What I would prefer that you do is go to their own statement. CBI has been reasonably public about these things. These are my words, not theirs. With respect to the contract, they have essentially, I call it, intercreditor agreement, but it's an agreement to share the cost and benefits of the contract among and between ourselves. And I think there are some financial disputes between the two of them. And we believe anyway that those disputes have some bearing on this unmitigated schedule we got. Paul Patterson : That actually leads me to my sort of second question, which is if one of the contractors, I know this is kind of little extreme, but let's say one of the contractors is unable to fulfill the obligations. Are the other contractors obligated? Is there a surety bond? Is there any protection, I guess? Thomas Fanning : Yes. The major mechanism you should look for in contract is the guarantee, the corporate guarantee of Toshiba for the financial integrity of the obligations of the participants as contractor. Paul Patterson : And then finally, with respect to the sales growth. Just to sort of follow-up on Dan's question, the numbers have been coming in a lot less than what you guys have expected in the past. And you do mentioned sort of some of the things, the oil prices and what have you in some of the developments that are happening there that you think will be -- that will improve the situation, I guess going forward. I know you guys analyze this very closely. Have you guys reappraised what you think long-term customer usage will be, efficiency deployment what have you? Is there any, because the numbers do seem to have come in just historically a lot lower. And I am just wondering if you guys have any sort of new ideas or any differing ideas as to what you've had in the past about what's going on with -- Thomas Fanning : Let me just kind of pick at that a little. Our plan was set last year at 0.7% sales growth and we actually had 0.9%. The difference was the fact that industrial was a blockbuster year at 3.3%, relative to weather normal flat elsewhere. Arthur Beattie : Paul, it's a long-term sales growth number. Total retail sales are going to be in the 1.2 percentage range. Now, whether that's a reassessment or not that's kind of our current look long-term. I don't know that it would be termed a reassessment of that, but it's probably lower than it was five, seven years ago. But a couple of other things you need to think about is in-migration into the states, we continue to see that. And to give you a little more land gap around that, if we look at things like United Van Lines has ranks their top 10 states for inbound moves; Georgia and Florida are number eight and number two respectively. We've seen most of our customer growth in those particular regions, 1.1% customer growth in both Gulf and Georgia over the last year. Thomas Fanning : And if you recall during the recession, in-migration grows up. Arthur Beattie : That's correct. Thomas Fanning : But we think that was our housing related. Now, that housing is freeing up, we're seeing the migration again. Arthur Beattie : So say reflection of, yes, is it a turning point? We certainly hope so, but it's based on the evidence, not just a bunch of drawn lines and hopes and wishes. The other thing that I think I would point to is the information that we have been traveling under is kind of similar to what the Fed has been traveling under. The Fed has called for some higher GDPs and actually show up and where the softness is and their projection has been in household wealth creation, just as we talked about. So as we improve that I think our overall picture will improve. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Dan Jenkins : So I just had a couple of clarifications related to the construction projects. First on Kemper, I think you had mentioned on your slide that the next set of milestones are the gasifier first fire, and I think case of that's going to be in March. But I was wondering on the gasifier airflow testing, what the timing is of that milestone? Arthur Beattie : Yes. We are currently in the process of that, but we still look at three main milestones here : first, fire to the gasifier, is it going to be this frame; the first syngas production, which is the second milestone I would point to is sometime this summer; and then in the late summer and fall, we expect to have reliable syngas to each combustion turbine. Those are the three milestones that we would rather point to than the micro milestones of, what you mentioned the, airflows. Those are sub-processes to the major milestone that I am pointing to. Thomas Fanning : And in fact, Dan, what we've been doing so far, and that's what I'm trying to gratified with, the tests that we've done so far, they have gone reasonably well, have been testing the financial integrity of the construction and it's gone very well. Dan Jenkins : And what did you say again was the timeline for the production of the turbine? Thomas Fanning : Reliable syngas, it was, for one turbine its late summer and for the second its fall this year. Dan Jenkins : And then looking at your Slides 5 and 6, I just want to make sure I am understanding this right. I think you mentioned in your opening remarks that for Unit 3, the CA01 set is going to be in the spring. That's not in the picture, I don't think on Slide 6. Thomas Fanning : Yes. That one is not in the picture. Dan Jenkins : But then that is a near-term thing in the spring pretty much as that CA01 set? Thomas Fanning : Yes. So the spring could go, I mean theoretically, it's April, May, June. That's kind of what we are looking for on CA01. Dan Jenkins : And then in your third quarter slide you had some talk on core on horizon the CA20, which I think, if I am not mistaken that's what the green one is on Unit 3, right, in the picture? Thomas Fanning : Yes, that's correct. Dan Jenkins : So when is that supposed to be set for Unit 4 the CA20? Thomas Fanning : Dan, if I could, here instead of getting specifics here, if I could ask you on, we just got this new integrated project schedule and there maybe some impacts for the longer term issue. That's why we stuck with near-term here and kind of very near-term. The longer term issues could be impacted by the resolution of the schedule. And so we're going to have to be a little -- I don't know, a little vague until we probably get the VCM 12. VCM 12 that we filed later this month and then will kind of discuss throughout the spring. We'll have much more detail there for you. I think we'll be in a much better position to estimate those kinds of issues. Dan Jenkins : I guess what you're saying you want to retain some flexibility around that based on -- Thomas Fanning : That's right. Thank you for that. Dan Jenkins : And then just you talked about the fact that there's this unmitigated proposal by the contractors, but what do you as some of the potential mitigation efforts that they have I guess look forward so far that you think would give us some confidence that the schedule could be shorter than these 18 months? Thomas Fanning : Dan, here again, I got to ask your patience. Let us go through what they've given us. We've received assurances by executive management of the contractors in 2014. We have our own ability to adjust. We have our own scheduled progress to date. There is a host of issues here that cause the foundation for our belief to be that there is something we could do, and that the contractors aren't exercising. All of their obligations is required under the contract. But let us get to the end of this discussion with contractors before I open up what the number may be. Operator : Our final question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium. Ashar Khan : I guess most of my questions are answered, but Tom, I guess I keep asking the strategy question. Because when you were the CFO, the risk adjusted was kind of the corner stone. And so as you in the board look into investing in Solar, what it has induced is now a higher range on the earnings availability, which further adds to the volatility of kind of a risk-free investment as there used to be. And I am just trying to understand why that is happening? Thomas Fanning : I got you absolutely. There is kind of a glib answer and there is kind of a deeper answer. The deeper answer is you know having known me for, gosh, over 10 years or whatever it is, a long time that I have been a deep proponent of the notion that value as a function of risk and return. And when we think about our business model, we always seek to achieve the best risk adjusted returns. When you look at the value driven by our franchise, which is the overwhelming delivery of value to Southern, the franchise is as good as it's ever been. And I feel terrific about the state of the franchise. When I go to the opportunity that is in front of us, with particularly Solar that opportunity is driven by kind of the initiatives that we have seen. When we originally dabbled our foot in water on Solar, we thought it might be applicable in the Southeast. Sure enough it was and so we started slow and gained some momentum and in fact Georgia has turned out to be a big participant in the solar market. Along the way, particularly last year, we were surprised by the fact that a lot of people were really looking to Southern, because we had scale. We had a tax appetite. We are a great partner. We understand technology. And I had mentioned before First Solar is kind of in that realm. The only risk that we seek that adds to kind of our corporate data, if you will, is just the lumpiness of the investment, not the technology of the investment. And we think the degree of investing is achievable, so while you may see some spread over time, we think we'll be able to hit the numbers that we put out there. The final comment, you all know that I've never been enormous fan of tax advantage investing. Certainly, the ITC profile is something that's attractive. We think we had tax appetite to be able to consume those tax benefits in a timely manner. And remember too, that one of the coincident benefits of that kind of investing has been the very strong cash flow compared to our EBITDA in the long run. So as we see ourselves moving through time where we're slowing down our CapEx from a corporate standpoint, particularly the operating companies, we're finishing up a construction cycle, the fact that these opportunities avail themselves, the fact that they help earnings, the fact that they improve cash flow, the fact that long-term we believe there is very low technology risk, and we're dealing with very credible partners, we think maintains this very attractive risk adjusted profile. Recall too, at the end of the day, the foundation of our investment is based on our ability to deliver long-term dividend growth. I think we finished our in 2014 with a payout ratio around 74%. We've been able to perform. The other thing that we said, I think in October and I always get my calls confused, but we're one of I think two companies in the industry that over the last 10 years somewhere in there has been able to produce within our earnings range every year 100% at the time. For all my purposes, I can't guarantee that going forward, but at least our track record is exemplary. And I think when you think about management teams around the system around the industry, when you think about business models around the industry, I think Southern Company is a company that's going to continue to deliver that performance in my opinion for a long time. Ashar Khan : I totally agree with your later points, but it just creates, Thomas, we used to write, there used to be I forget what those terms used to be called, the synfuel tax credit earnings, which Congress used to have and everything. These are now ITC earnings now coming into utilities of things, I think there is a differentiation of quality of earnings going down? Thomas Fanning : Yes. But Ashar I would really differentiate, and we should take this offline just for the benefit of everybody else on the call, but we should really differentiate synfuel from ITC. There is an enormous industry for solar. It's pretty clear that not only the administration, but Congress is in favor of promoting tax code that helps renewables. That's very different than synfuel. And I feel very confident about the ability to sustain these tax credits and how they will improve our cash flow and really helps Southern and therefore our shareholders for years to come. I really would think about those differently. Operator : And at this time there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? End of Q&A Thomas Fanning : Yes. Thank you. Once again, thank you all for joining us. We really enjoy these times together. I am really delighted with the results that we've been able to show in '14. When I was just talking with Ashar about the value of the franchise, when you look at the foundation that is Southern Company, it is as good today as it has ever been in my memory. And I think we can continue to produce the kind of results that have tremendous value to our customers and our shareholders. We are taking advantage of other opportunities in the market, in solar and other areas, and we're seeking to add to that platform of value creation. So thank you for your time today. We will continue relentlessly to meet the challenges and provide the best opportunity available as an investment to you all. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background notice. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir. Dan Tucker : Thank you, Jos\u00e9. Welcome everyone to Southern Company's first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we've released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call can be viewed on our Investor Relations Web site at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Many of you've heard me speak before about the full portfolio and its significance to Southern Company and to our industry as a whole, simply put, we are inventing the future of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for the benefit of the customers and communities we serve. Our full portfolio strategy which includes new nuclear and innovative new technologies for 21st century coal, as well as natural gas, renewable and energy efficiency is a fundamental component of that mission. I would like to take a few moments to highlight how this all of the above approach continues to be beneficial to customers and to discuss several projects helping to shape the full portfolio for the future. To begin with, our diverse generation fleet enables us to quickly adapt to constantly changing market conditions with the ability to utilize the most cost efficient generation resources at any particular point in time. When natural gas prices are low, for example we are able to take advantage by burning more natural gas and less coal. Such was the case in the first quarter of this year, gas energy climbed to 48% of our energy production. Our use of coal for the quarter was the lowest in several decades falling to 32% of our energy mix. And as a hallmark of our integrated business model we passed those savings along to our customers. Natural gas of course will continue to be a dominant solution. Recently our gas consumption was about 1.5 Bcf per day. This year it could approach 1.9 Bcf per day and by 2020 the amount could be as much as 2.3 Bcf per day. But natural gas is not a panacea as we cannot assume that current prices will endure indefinitely. We must therefore, continue to pursue the development of a truly diverse generation portfolio, one that provides the necessary optionality and flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. In addition to natural gas 21st century coal and new nuclear, we are rapidly building out our energy portfolio with renewables including solar and wind. With that in mind, I would like to take a more detailed look at how we\u2019ve expanded our renewable resources in recent months. Four Southern Company subsidiaries recently marked major milestones in the strategic expansion of one of the nation's largest renewable energy portfolios through the announced development or acquisition of large scale solar projects. Gulf Power and Mississippi Power recently announced power purchase agreements with solar facilities totaling 173 megawatts that are currently being developed on military bases in their respective states. Georgia Power broke ground at Fort Benning, the first of four 30 megawatt retail rate based solar project in development with the U.S. Department of Defense. And there is more likely to come. In February our Southern Power subsidiary announced the acquisition of two solar projects totaling 99 megawatts in Georgia, the 80 megawatt Decatur Parkway solar project and the 19 megawatt Decatur County solar project, and most recently Southern Power announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in the 32 megawatt Lost Hills-Blackwell Solar facility in California from First Solar. Also in March Southern Power announced an agreement to acquire the 299 megawatt Kay Wind Facility currently under construction in Oklahoma. This acquisition is expected to close in late 2015 upon successful completion of the project. Kay Wind will be the largest renewable electric generation plant in the Southern Company system and the first wind facility we will own. Upon completion of these projects that Southern Company system expects own or purchase the output of more than 3,100 megawatts of renewable resources system wide including 44 solar facilities in seven states. Let's now discuss our two large construction projects which are equally important to our full portfolio of generation resources. Our new nuclear project plant Vogtle units 3 and 4 and our 21st century coal facility in Kemper County, Mississippi featuring coal gasification technology developed by our researchers in partnership with KBR and the Department Of Energy. Both of these projects stem from state specific resource planning processes that value generation diversity including the hedge that these new resources represent again potential Carbon Dioxide regulations in the future. First, an update on plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. The primary focus of the project continues to be on quality and safety. Georgia Power has maintained an exceptional safety record for a construction project of this size which currently has over 5,000 people on site. During the first quarter our outstanding safety culture manifested itself as we performed over 1 million safe work hours without a recordable injury. The quality oversight from our nuclear team continues to be invaluable. This is a complex project with numerous challenges. We are proud of how well our processes and controls are holding up to the inspections of both the NRC inspectors and Georgia Power\u2019s regulator. More importantly our own rigorous oversight is being manifested in the quality of the facility. The new Vogtle units are being built to serve Georgia customers for 60 plus years and the oversight in place today should help ensure that these units will function at a high level for decades to come. Construction activities are tracking closely with the revised schedule provided by the contractors in January. The greatest risk to the schedule for both units continues to be in the timely delivery of structural sub modules. I\u2019m pleased to report that the quality at the Lake Charles facility has improved and we no longer expect sub modules from that facility to require remediation on site before being released for assembly. We anticipate continued delivery of panels throughout the year from Lake Charles and we\u2019ve been informed that the scope of work may be expanding there. Critical path remains closely aligned with delivery and installation of panels for the shield building. These panels are fabricated by Newport News Industrial and quality has been good. Acceleration of work at NNI along with improving the panel installation process represents one of our best opportunities to improve on the schedule provided by the contractors. Critical path runs somewhat parallel with activities inside the containment vessel. The CA01 module is one of the major next step inside this area of nuclear island. The final concrete pours necessary to install CA01 were completed late last week. CA01 is now projected to be lifted into place early in the third quarter of this year. A number of you have visited the site in person and the progress is obvious. While the entire project is proceeding well, the Unit 3 Annex Building is an area of noteworthy progress. The Annex Building is necessary for the initial energization of the control systems for Unit 3 an important early step in the startup process.  The concrete foundations and structural steel for this facility are well underway. And in late February the first of 34 wall sub modules for the Unit 4 CA20 module was [up ended] [ph] marking the start of the assembly process. On the regulatory front $198 million in expenditures submitted in the 11th Vogtle construction monitoring report were unanimously approved on February 19th with a cumulative amount approved to date of $2.8 billion. Additionally the procedural and scheduling order for the 12th Vogtle construction monitoring report was approved on April 7th, consistent with the long standing Georgia Law the order reaffirmed that neither the project certified cost nor the VCM 8 stipulation in 2013 constitute a cost recovery cap. Georgia Power will be allowed recovery of all reasonable and prudent start up costs up to and above the certified amount and we believe the semi-annual VCM process including the testimony of the independent monitor continues to build a record that has thoroughly documented Georgia Power\u2019s prudent management of the project. The order also establishes a schedule for filings and hearings on our request of the commission to verify and improve $169 million in expenditures for the second half of 2014. Georgia Power expects to file direct testimony on Friday, hearings are scheduled to begin on June 2nd and we anticipate a decision in mid-August. A full schedule is included in our slide deck. Now let\u2019s turn to an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. The Kemper project also boasts a terrific safety record. With now over 2,500 workers on site no safety incidents occurred during the first quarter. In early March we completed the first firing with natural gas of the facility\u2019s gasifier burners, a significant milestone. We continue to make tremendous progress on our other start up activities as we look ahead to the first synthesis gas production plan now for third quarter. In the mean time the combined cycle at Kemper continues to perform exceptionally well with the first quarter equivalent force outage rate of less than 1%, and a capacity factor in line with the rest of our combined cycle fleet. Turning to the legal and regulatory fronts the Mississippi Supreme Court's order which deemed that the 2013 Kemper settlement unenforceable and reversed the subsequent rate order has been met with vocal composition from state wide industry groups, business organizations, the state economic council and members of the public utility staff and commission as well as other public entities through amicus briefs filed with the Mississippi Supreme Court. Most of the briefs emphasize that the rate plan agreed to in 2013 was of great benefit to the customers of Mississippi power and then a traditional rate case could mean rate impacts approaching 40% for some customers. This compared to the 25% rate increase contemplated in the original settlement 18% of which is already in place. While we wait the Court's decision on rehearing we will continue to work towards a reasonable comprehensive settlement with the public utility staff. However as a possible alternative to a settlement we are also preparing to file a rate case by mid May. With the completion of the project and site we want to ensure that the rate recovery is adequately addressed in a timely manner. I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview. Art Beattie : Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2015 reporting earnings of 508 million or 0.56 per share compared with earnings of 351 million or 0.39 per share in the first quarter of last year. First quarter results for 2015 include a $6 million after tax charge related to an increased construction estimate for Mississippi Power's Kemper integrated gasification combined cycle project. The first quarter results for 2014 included a $235 million after-tax charge for the Kemper IGCC project or $0.27 per share. Excluding these items, Southern Company earned $514 million or 0.56 per share during the first quarter of 2015 compared to $586 million or $0.66 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were in line with our expectations and were positively influenced by retail revenue effects at Southern Company\u2019s traditional operating companies, offset by milder winter weather than in 2014 and increased operating and maintenance expenses. Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2015 was modest but our retail sales across all customer classes are encouraging. Total weather adjusted retail sales grew 1% in the first quarter lead by industrial sales which were up 2%. We have now enjoyed eight consecutive quarters of positive year-over-year industrial sales growth in our region. Industrial sales growth remained broad based across eight of our largest 10 industrial segments. The strongest industrial segments include petroleum up 10%, stone, clay and glass up 6% due to improvements in the housing market. Transportation improved 5% as automotive manufacturers expanded output. Weather adjusted residential sales were slightly positive for the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to strong customer growth of nearly 16,000, a 55% increase over the approximate 10,000 new customers gained in the first quarter of 2014. Weather adjusted commercial sales were up 0.7% for the quarter, office vacancy rates continue to show signs of improvement and more office retail projects are being announced. Currently more than 1.9 million square feet of office space is under construction in Metro Atlanta, in addition a number of new Atlanta projects are expected to begin construction soon, including the Mercedes Benz headquarters. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics non-farm employment increased in all of the states of our retail service territory between February of 2014 and February of 2015. Nationally Georgia ranked number five among all states for job growth and Atlanta was ranked among the top five metro areas. Meanwhile our economic development pipeline remains robust with more than 300 potential projects representing 37,000 potential new jobs and over $34 billion in potential capital investment. The climate for business and investment remains strong in our service region. Alabama and Georgia were recently ranked number one and number four respectively amongst states in which to do business by Site Selection magazine. Turning briefly back to Southern Power as Tom mentioned in his opening remarks Southern Power continues to find new projects that meet its investment criteria. In our fourth quarter call in early February we outlined two categories for Southern Power\u2019s CapEx projections, base CapEx and placeholder CapEx for growth. Base CapEx includes projects we have identified as likely even though we may not have reached final terms or received all regulatory approvals. In February our base CapEx included among others the Kay Wind and Decatur projects Tom mentioned earlier. Since then Southern Power has identified a number of additional projects for 2015 and 2016. As a result we are shifting dollars out of the placeholder category and into base CapEx for Southern Power. The result is that we have accounted for all of our original 2015 placeholders and have moved 100 million from the placeholder to base in 2016. With our 2015 success thus far and the long runway between now and the end of 2016 we are confident about our ability to find plan solid projects to account for our remaining 2016 placeholders. Before turning the call back to Tom let me cover two final items. First our earnings estimate for the second quarter which is 0.69 per share. Secondly I'd like to highlight dividend announcements last week. Our Board of Directors approved a $0.7 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.17 per share. This is our 14th consecutive annual increase and marks 270 consecutive quarters dating back to 1948 that Southern Company will have paid a dividend equal to or greater than the previous quarter to its shareholders. Over the past decades our dividend has accounted for nearly 70% of our total shareholder return. It is the corner stone of our value proposition and the board's decision of last week reinforces its confidence in the strength of our long-term financial plan. I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Art. After a successful year in 2014, Southern Company has entered the New Year with strong momentum. We see a franchise business that is operating better than ever, solidifying its position as an industry-leader in all phases of the business. We see important progress on major capital projects and we continue excel with our customer focused business model. We also see a strengthening economy and a region poised to grow in the months and years ahead. In short, we believe Southern Company is well-positioned to succeed in 2015 and in the years ahead, behind the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and communities we serve. Southern Company is keenly focused on remaining an industry leader for the long-term and forward thinking decisions with regard to our generating portfolio a key aspect of that effort. But the evolution of our business does not stop there, we recently announced the launch of a energy innovation center to be located in Atlanta's Technology Square, while we remain stead fast in our commitment to excel the fundamentals of making, moving and selling and consuming electricity. We also understand that the way in which customers use energy may change over time. The energy innovation centers is just one way in which we are working to anticipate the future and lead the way with the development of new energy innovation. Going forward we will continue to build on our long history of inventing the future by relying on the thinking of our entire work force and with potential such as [Meth] and other major established and new entrants to the energy industry. Initial possibilities involve expanding the motion of energy infrastructure to assets beyond the meter un-manned aerial vehicles, hydrogen production from underutilized generating facilities and desalination plants. As Art indicated earlier the strength of our underlying franchise as well as our continued focus on remaining an industry leader through innovation underpin the Board's decision last week to increase our dividend which supports our objective of providing superior risk adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long-term. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator we will now take the first question. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Gordon : So what is the legal path in Mississippi today that either gets you back to a settled rate deal or puts you in a formal rate case filing? What are the different paths that get us back into a settled low rate hike or just into a rate filing in May? Tom Fanning : Just as we described there is two paths, one is we\u2019ve been having as you all know prolong series of discussion with the staff, we continue to think they\u2019re constructive. I think the result of a settlement could in essence preserve and form the rate structure that we put in place in 2013. Failing to reach a settlement, we will file a rate increase in a conventional rate case. It is conceivable you could file the rate case and file the settlement at the same time. But those are the two paths. Greg Gordon : But the Supreme Court\u2019s decision has essentially closed off the creative approach you used to prefunding the capital prospects or is that not the case? Tom Fanning : No, that\u2019s not the case. The settlement would essentially preserve the structure which would mimic what was approved in 2013. Greg Gordon : Second question is on your continued expansion of renewables platform, when we look at - so essentially the announcement of this wind project acquisition it fills in some of the sort of notional space in your Southern Power CapEx budget? Tom Fanning : That\u2019s right. Greg Gordon : It\u2019s not incremental to the budget that you\u2019ve already articulated to us? Tom Fanning : It\u2019s part of the \u2013 yes, it was in the base already. And what we\u2019ve done is I think the change here, it\u2019s on the graph we showed, is that we essentially have spoken for all the placeholders in '15, so we\u2019re very confident of hitting our numbers for Southern Power in '15. Greg Gordon : And then how much of your total CapEx in '16 at Southern Power is currently sort of money projects that are definitely going forward versus placeholders or that\u2019s on page 12. Tom Fanning : I think it's 400 million. Greg Gordon : And could you articulate -- sorry go ahead. Tom Fanning : We feel really good about hitting our placeholders in '16 also but we\u2019re not as the stage we're ready to declare those as part of base. We\u2019ve improved it by 100 million. Greg Gordon : And then is there what you can articulate what you think the earnings contribution is going to be from the Kay Wind facility when it comes in? Art Beattie : The Kay Wind facility the benefits are not investment tax credits, they\u2019re production tax credits. So I don\u2019t recall the '16 benefit but it should not benefit '15 at all, it will be a '16 addition. Tom Fanning : It will be a little over $0.01 a year, something like that for whatever\u2026 Greg Gordon : And when is the next milestone if we have a firm milestone? This is my last question. Your conversations with your EP&C contractors Vogtle with regard to the delay they announced in service date. Tom Fanning : So we continue to have constructive discussions there. One of the things I think we tried to highlight in the initial remarks it that we can see our way through to some ways to improve the schedule that the contractors have delivered to us. We\u2019ve been pretty clear about that in our disclosures. So we continue to work with them and we\u2019re trying to find ways to reach an amicable kind of resolution to that. Greg Gordon : And is there a sort of definitive milestone to look forward there in terms of drop dead date or\u2026? Tom Fanning : Not really. The ultimate conclusion would be litigation in the City of Augusta, Georgia. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of James von Riesemann from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. James von Riesemann : I have two questions for you, so the first question is can you guys provide a little bit more color on this continuing disconnect between the 3% GDP growth in the service territory and yet 0.2% residential growth? Art Beattie : Jim, our expectation was for the year about 3% GDP growth that was underlying our forecast of low growth this year of the 1.3%. We\u2019ve had a very strong economy here in the Southeast, I think our numbers and results reflect that as we outlined in the scripts that\u2019s driven by the industrial sales growth. But we\u2019re beginning to see movement on the residential and the commercial land as well, this is the first quarter in about four years where we\u2019ve had positive growth in all three customer classes. So we think it\u2019s broad based and if we look at employment growth both in the manufacturing sector and in other sectors, it\u2019s beating the national numbers. So the economy in the southeast has been a bit stronger in our view than what we\u2019re seeing on the 0.2%. Tom Fanning : Yes, at a risk of falling into fed speak too, there is fascinating development and some of the things we\u2019re seeing are better than but in some ways mimic what we\u2019re seeing nationally. Better than clearly in the industrial growth sector, even surprising to us how strong it is. And even probably better than what we\u2019re showing we think that chemicals for example was slightly negative but those were outages. So we expect to see chemicals rebound and recall a continuing theme has been segments which are dependent upon natural gas, well those are going to be really strong we think for the rest of the year. The only kind of cloud on the horizon there primary metals and we think that\u2019s kind of strong dollar, strong imports low oil prices and therefore metal associated with the pipeline is probably slowing down a bit. But one the things that I think is really interesting that Art alluded to on the residential sector we are starting to see a pickup in household wealth formation, it\u2019s pretty modest but still a pickup. Interestingly the fed guys are concerned by that, in that it looks like they are not consuming this pick up in either the top line revenue or a reduction in cost like lower gasoline prices, they are saving it. We are within kind of an historical range of savings rates so it\u2019s not particularly troubling to me. And frankly if households are reducing debt or investing or even just putting money in a checking account for now at least they are less exposed, they are more resilient to future economic dislocations. So it\u2019s not all bad, value is a function of risk and return, and GDP growth is return, increased savings rates is improvement in risk. So it\u2019s not all bad and when you consider that the United States GDP was 0.2% growth in the first quarter you look at our numbers clearly better. We feel pretty good about our prospects going forward. James von Riesemann : So the answer to the question on the growth and the improvement leads me into my next question. So if I look at your trailing 12 months on a weather normalized basis you are 276, but if I remember correctly at the end of the \u2013 in conjunction with the fourth quarter call you had 276 to 288 which are your expectations for the year? How do you get to the upper end of that band or even the middle end of that band given that trailing 12 is at the very bottom? Tom Fanning : Improvement at Southern Power is an easy way. Art Beattie : Good weather, better than expected economic outcomes. James von Riesemann : Okay. And then just on - there is nothing else that I am missing, am I? Art Beattie : I don\u2019t think so. Tom Fanning : No, if you remember too, one of things I think we said this before Art was the lower end of our range was down by Southern Power not filling in its complement of CapEx, it kind of lived with the base scenario. We think we\u2019re there for 2015 and potentially could even improve. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Brian Chin : Just a quick one, the long-term EPS CAGR slide isn\u2019t in the deck, are we just to assume that it\u2019s still 3% to 4% longer term? Tom Fanning : Yes. We only adjust that kind of once a year, right. We come out every January and we give guidance for the year on our long-term growth estimate and then we only update that in our October call once we\u2019ve gotten through the big earnings month in the summer. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett from Morningstar Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. Mark Barnett : A couple of questions here one sort of bigger picture, you gave a little bit of detail around what you\u2019re seeing in the commercial sector and obviously from a usage perspective it\u2019s lag a little bit but we have a nice pick up here in the quarter. I\u2019m wondering is this about the level of improvement that you\u2019ve taken for expectations in your guidance here. Tom Fanning : Actually, we\u2019re looking for a little more improvement. The expectations for the year in terms of segments. Art Beattie : Like 1.4 on commercial about one on residential and 1.7 on industrial, so we\u2019re bit ahead of our industrial numbers. We're still about a little way to go on commercial. Tom Fanning : Yes, 1.3 for the year total. Mark Barnett : Right, sorry that number is 1.4% on commercial that\u2019s the level that's been in your guidance. And then year-over-year obviously base business growth driving a lot of that OpEx I\u2019m sure, is this level kind of the year-over-year increase sort of a guide for the remainder of the year and you have lot of flexibility there. Tom Fanning : Flexibility on CapEx is going to go to Southern Power\u2026. Art Beattie : The first quarter was a bit of an anomaly, you may remember Mark that first quarter of last year we deferred a lot of the expenses at Alabama Power they were non-nuclear outage costs under an accounting order that they were operating under last year. And then also if you look at year-over-year there were more megawatts out this year across the system than it were last year. So there are more outage costs this year. And then you just got normal growth for the rest that's a big piece of it is well. So if we look at what we expect for the year I still think my guidance from the last call was about 3% to 3.5% growth in non-fuel O&M for the year still applies and the first quarter is just kind of an outlier that will correct itself through the year. Tom Fanning : And when we came up with the $0.55 estimate for the first quarter, almost exactly expected this levels O&M. Mark Barnett : Thanks for the reminder it has been a long day if somebody mentioned earlier. Last question can you just remind me if Governor Dean has signed the new solar bill, HP37. And generally what you expect to see as a result in terms of maybe your own programs or offerings in the state? Tom Fanning : He has not signed it to our knowledge, but I can tell you all this is very consistent with our plan I have always tried to position the company as given whatever business circumstances exist for us to find ways to play often. And to the extent distributor generations becomes important to the customers to this state it is the clear mission of our businesses to provide that service and those assets to our customers. So we fully support any development with respect to distributed generation whether that's rooftop solar or some ideas that they were storage or community solar or financing or anything else. Now whether we do that ourselves or do it through third parties our job is to find ways to succeed in this changing business environment. And I think we're demonstrating that in a superb way. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Crowdell : I just want to follow up on Mr. Gordon goes to Washington's question and Mississippi. Just it seem that there is a disconnect there when you look at that the two road maps you have over conventional rate case for the 30% to 40% rate increase or I'm not sure if you use this term but maybe a glide path or some type of nice trajectory of rate increases. It would seem like a no brainer if you were a regulator or you are running the intervene parties. Could you maybe highlight what that disconnect is and maybe handicap what you think to chances are of a potential settlement in Mississippi? Tom Fanning : Anthony the only thing I can tell you I don't want to characterize the decision that's kind of in front of these folks, but if you look at the broad based support that the company has enjoyed to ask the Supreme Court to reconsider their decision in the amicus briefs, including the task to me it is an obvious decision that benefits the citizens of Mississippi to pursue the settlement or at least restore what the Supreme Court validated in its recent order, either one of those is I think in a broad sense the obvious way to go in the state. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Weinstein : First question is about pipeline to midstream opportunities wondering if you are still considering going forward with that and how serious is that consideration? Tom Fanning : Yes, here's some fascinating supporting data. We're actually looking at several opportunities and active discussions, will see how that goes. When you think about it before I came into this role we were consuming coal 70% of our energy came from coal and then 15% from natural gas. When you look at recent history 1.5 bcf per day, now this year may be as high as 1.9 and depending on what happens with 111 (d) and a variety of other things that per day gas consumption can average somewhere around 2.3 bcf per day. So, when you think about the attractiveness of Southern Company being one of the nation's largest consumers of natural gas, our value as a kind of key tenant to any of the infrastructure that needs to be build out to meet that kind of demand really gives us some opportunities to pursue a variety of investments and we're all over with that stuff, so we'll see what happens. Anthony Crowdell : How about gas reserves and rate base? Tom Fanning : This goes way back even when I was CFO and COO, so we\u2019re talking now 10 years ago we\u2019ve been kind of kicking that around. And back then we weren't consuming that much natural gas and it wasn\u2019t as important. But certainly it\u2019s an idea that has merits and as natural gas becomes more important to us especially given its volatility relative to other fuel stocks we we'll certainly keep that on the front burner of ideas. In any case we would not want to take price risk on molecules in the ground this would all fuel clause related issue. Anthony Crowdell : One other question about nuclear. We\u2019ve heard recently from Commissioner Echols that he sees the need for another two units beyond the current and that it depends on how well the project goes and whether 111 (d) goes, so I am just wondering if you have actually been in conversations about that, is that something that\u2019s actually been planned out at this point or is it just talk for now? And also is this something that you can hold over the consortium's head so-to-speak, that guarantees some kind of good performance going forward also in the litigation? Tom Fanning : So many of you on the call may remember in 2014, I want to say it was the summer and a Q&A session that\u2019s by far some policy center I think after a talk I made that I did alluded the fact that we would be I forget delighted to consider new nuclear. The steps that would be taken first would be to essentially begin the permitting process to undertake a new plant, not necessarily to commit to build a new plant. So in essence it\u2019s fairly modest dollars in order to secure the option. And we moved along and then we were hit in December with the change in schedule put forth by our contractor group. We were very clear that we don\u2019t believe that the contractors are doing everything they can do in order to fully mitigate their schedule per the requirements of the contracts. And so what I said at that time was that I thought it was sensible for us to set aside a lot of talk about new projects until we came to more resolution as to the commercial dispute. It is clear to me that if the contractors want to succeed in the United States with AP1000 then they need to perform well on Votgle 3 and 4. It is in fact the benchmark plant for all AP1000s going forward. So, you can draw your own conclusions as to their motives. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Eggers : Tom just on the nuclear conversation can you maybe just share some of the things that you guys saw to expedite or to catch up on the delays of the EPC folks, number one. And then number two if you look at kind of how they got their delays and schedule, are there things you\u2019re going to be able to do to mitigate that from happening kind of going forward so we don't run into this 12 or 18 months from now them saying while we have the same sort of delay problems? Tom Fanning : So we try to kind of suggest that in the prepared remarks at the outset. I think there is a clear opportunity to advance some scheduled mitigation with new Newport News, that\u2019s our opinion. And it\u2019s not only production of their facilities but also the installation of the panels. We need to make sure that all of that is done well. Also you must know that, especially those of you that have visited the site we encourage everybody on the phone if you can figure out a way to get to the site, we love showing it off. I think the people that were there were I think really struck with the kind of progress and quality of the work there. We have an enormous quality assurance program and as licensee of the plant we ultimately are responsible for having the right kind of plant built there. Our QA program has been focused not only on site but also at places like Lake Charles, and I think our working with the contractors itself put them in the position where now we essentially have been able to accept production out of that facility and go ahead and put it in the production process. As we move to more work inside the nuclear island that kind of process improvement, quality assurance and ultimately production on site is going to move the needle in the right direction. So we remained relentlessly focused on ways to work with them to do that. And I would argue in the past quarter or so I think we've made some progress in our thinking. Dan Eggers : And then just to ask a question, but just on the gas reserves and rate base issue. The legislation in Mississippi seemed to open that as a little bit more of a window than previously discussed. Is that something you guys are going to look for sure how do you read that legislative action? Tom Fanning : Well it\u2019s largely focused on E&Ps recovery of economic development projects. It does authorize the PSE to deem the natural gas reserves are used and useful as utility plan or whatever. So a similar concept -- so it is something we would consider as there is natural gas kind of generation in Mississippi I think once you're post Kemper rank with 3rd coal gas and Kemper. A similar concept that we have at Kemper is in fact that the Lignite mine. It\u2019s a similar idea where essentially we own the Lignite and it\u2019s in rate days and it serves to hedge kind of any future price swings. Remember that is almost no volatility going forward. So it\u2019s certainly a valid idea something we consider and make sense. Daniel Eggers : And I guess just on the renewable side of the business, I guess we\u2019re able to put renewables in right place in Georgia in PPAs in the other states, is there going to be an opportunity when you guys start putting or feel more comfortable putting some of those assets into your rate base rather than contracting out where the cost of capitals are. Tom Fanning : Sure. I think to the extent those assets ever get flipped, so what have you. I think we\u2019re a natural buyer. One of the things that we always kind of think about is for any of our assets and although we tend to acquire some you know we sold some and swapped some, who is the best owner. And we always seek to achieve that position. So I think there will be opportunities for us, should those assets ever come to the market for us to be a strong player in acquiring that, that maybe a Southern Power or could be at the OpCo. Daniel Eggers : But you don\u2019t necessarily see the utilities doing more to develop renewables in territory in rate base asset. Tom Fanning : No, absolutely we could and in fact I try to suggest that in that little funny sense right there and there is probably more to come if you remember that sense. We\u2019ve done a lot of business in Georgia, we\u2019ve done four times 30 with DOD facility and there is more to come. So I\u2019m very bullish on that. We\u2019ve had a terrific relationship with the DOD. You know, that the DOD has a renewable mandate goal what have you and I think we were probably the first ones in the United States to work with them constructively to fulfill that mandate. Operator : Our next question is come from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Ali Agha : First question Tom, just wanted to clarify your scenarios on getting closure on the Mississippi issue. I think one of the options previously was for the Supreme Court to overturn their ruling which I guess was 5.4. Is that still an option or are you really thinking if global settlement could address all the issues they raised in the original ruling and take care of it from that perspective. Art Beattie : Ali, it\u2019s both of those I mean the Supreme Courte could certainly reconsider their decision that obviously and think about the broad supporting the state just about everybody in the state that we had huge participation in the amicus briefs. But tailing that we could reach a global settlement which would in effect mimic many of the characteristics of the original rate order that was entered into in 2013, we could get that as well. We think any those are better than filling for 40% increase in the rate case but we\u2019ll see how it goes, those are the path we will follow. Ali Agha : And also be clear I think you mentioned thinking about filing that rate case about mid May just couple of weeks from here. So in your mind the other two parts whether a global settlement or a Supreme Court reversal realistically could happen within the next couple of weeks? Art Beattie : Sure. And then I suggested on the call earlier today that another alternative for us to file the settlement proposal, at the same time would temper us with the conventional rate case. Ali Agha : And then secondly this show cause notice that they put out there to you guys on market bought issues, how big of a deal is that or do you see that playing out? Tom Fanning : We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal right now. Look, I don\u2019t think there is any evidence in my opinion there is very little evidence, no evidence Southern Power has any market power in the Southeast. I think it was a reaction by the first half that basically pointed out that there was not much activity in our auction mechanism that we had put in place, really up until 2014. In 2015 we introduced kind of a tweak on that auction process which increased the activity of the auction many folds. But you got to understand through this period we\u2019ve been a net purchaser not seller. So heaven sake I don\u2019t know how we exercise market power as a net purchaser of energy.  Number two, the southeast has been traditionally a bilateral market and people are very happy. There has been no contention at FERC that suggest that there is something wrong with the auction process we have in place. This in fact was flow by the FERC that basically is raising a question where I am not sure there is any problem at all. So we have a chance to respond and we we'll provide our evidence and have a good constructed dialogue with FERC and we'll see how it goes. In the near-term you should think about that in the next three to five years. At least the thinking we've done so far there is almost no potential adverse financial impact from this. Ali Agha : And then in your financial planning you still have assumed no equity issuance through '17. I was just curious how much cushion do you have right now so that that scenario different scenarios keep you in that no equity issuance mode or are you fairly close if you get more Southern Power activity et cetera that equity comes back into the equation. Art Beattie : Yes, Ali just recall last year we issued 800 million versus the 600 week plan. So we're a bit ahead of where we thought we'd be. We don't really have any scenarios in which in the foreseeable future even with the Southern Power investments that we have outlined in our CapEx program where we would need more equity. It would have to be in access of the amounts that we forecast and you can see we filled up our bucket in 2015 on placeholder projects and we strive away to go 2016. So I think we're good to give you a feel for I don't have a number to give you about where we are in the limit, but I think we're in pretty good shape. Tom Fanning : And I think we've suggested in the past that kind of as we start to wind down our CapEx and if you look at our CapEx slide kind of, what was it to 6.8 to 5.5 or to 4.3 or something like that. We're probably over-equitized to some degree. So there is not pressure to sell more equity. Operator : And our next question is coming from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides : Congrats on a good start to the year and especially on the renewable side. One quick Mississippi question and then one natural gas question for you. In Mississippi the court decision referenced pretty clearly the need for a prudency review before the commission can grant any kind of rate increases. And given that the stems from a rate pair or customers acting as litigant here, do you need to have a prudency hearing of some kind as part of any settlement docket? Tom Fanning : We've already filed a prudency record last year. So we think all the evidences there necessary for the commission to act right now. Michael Lapides : So the commission could issue a prudency determination based on what's in the record right now and that should satisfy effectively what the Supreme Court said had not been satisfied when the Supreme Court made its ruling? Tom Fanning : That is our belief. Michael Lapides : On the natural gas side when you look at the infrastructure of the natural gas system throughout your service territory and maybe even slight neighboring areas. Where do you all see is the biggest bottle mix meaning where is there lack of midstream infrastructure that is needed to be able to over the next. I want say five to ten years because it's kind of hard to look much more beyond that to help alleviate some natural gas or other midstream related bottle mix in your area? Tom Fanning : Yes. That's a fascinating question and I wish I had my map and my pointer and it really depends on what you believe at 111 (d) and what we do with other kind of the display co-assets should they arise, recall under their half [mac or math] we went from kind of 20,000 megawatt down the 13,000 with 4,000 total unit being retired -- being converted to gas 3,000 retired completely. By EPAs own math and I'm not going to stand by their math because I frankly don't believe it's a achievable in the timeframe as they do. But they would have us retire enough coal down about 4,000 megawatt, so what do you do, do you convert that to gas? Do you build Greenfield gas where do you build it? If you want to think about the way the pipes work in the southeast there is kind of tow big themes. The normal conventional historical theme would has come from the west and you got a lot of pipelines that kind of run from the gulf of Mexico up through the North Western part of Georgia if you want to think about it that way. Where you don't have a whole lot of distance to cover, you have some embedded costs that are attractive. And we could certainly link in to systems to the west. And there is even if not just Gulf of Mexico stuff right, there is Fayetteville and some other areas out there that are shale gas related. The other theme would come out of kind of the north and so you would think about pipes that may come down north to south and kind of approach our territory more from the east. And so we'll see how that goes, you are talking about probably more expensive pipes so can you get a basis difference than the gas between the north and say Henry hub looking and kind of proxy. So that's really the two big themes in gas infrastructure that we seem to see. Michael Lapides : My apologies real quick back on Mississippi and this maybe our Art question. Art given the court case and where it stands now. What happened in the first quarter from a GAAP accounting perspective in revenues in Mississippi versus what had been basically going on to all of '13 and '14? And I am just trying to kind of match up our GAAP revenue numbers to the Mississippi rate increases, are they reflected in GAAP revenue I know the cash was collected previously. I am just trying to think through the puts and takes here. Art Beattie : Michael we didn\u2019t record any mere equipped revenue in the first quarter but there were some impacts for equity return on some other pieces that actually went back into fourth quarter of last year where we un-book some of that but it was very -- it was all really deferred. I don\u2019t have a number to give you but I can give you some math to recall. Michael Lapides : Just trying to think big picture you're basically no longer booking the revenue related to Kemper, that $156 million number. Art Beattie : Well, all of that was never going to the income per se it was all being booked on the balance sheet as a regulatory liability and it was going to be used to offset rate increases as the plant went into service over time that was the whole design of mere [equipped]. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shar Pourreza : Just real question quick question on Mississippi, I know you\u2019re kind of working on potentially striking a global settlement. So can you remind us if the asset has sort of a capacity factor hurdle it has to meet once it is live? It\u2019s good to see that it\u2019s running like a CCGT I am kind of curious on what the hurdles are once it\u2019s live? Art Beattie : Recall that the combined cycle that\u2019s running right now is running on natural gas. Ultimately we have been working with the commission on an arrangement in which when you think about it when we had the project certified there was a capital cost component and then there was an energy cost component. And what we\u2019ve been able to kind of think about in the settlement is a way for us to essentially assure that Mississippi customers are held harmless from any comp over runs we\u2019ve done that painfully for all of us. And then otherwise to assure that the energy benefits are there for Mississippi's customers and I think we can get that done. Now you all must recognize that when plant Radcliffe was originally approved this is a process that occurred in 2009 and 2010 and remember we only had 10% of the engineering done, there's been a host of changes in a variety of fronts including natural gas prices, commodity prices, all host of things. I think what we would undertake to do is make sure that we could deliver the energy benefit that the commission thought they were getting when the project was approved. We\u2019ve already spoken for the capital cost. I think we can get that done. Shar Pourreza : And then, just one question on renewables Tom as we\u2019re starting to see some more contracts being designed post ITC step down. Curious on if you\u2019re seeing that within the Southeast? And then kind of what that placeholder could look like for Southern Power between wind and solar say post 2016? Tom Fanning : So, what\u2019s interesting Shar is that right now there is an enormous rush to get stuff done particularly in solar before the end of '16. And certainly that has filled up our wheelbarrow of capital placeholders for '15 and we feel really good about where we are for '16. The wind deal was a way to startle in fact it was interesting one of our own directors used the phrase that did it and kind of the development activity of renewables and therefore earnings associated with the renewable. The other thing that\u2019s fascinating is as we start to consider kind of beyond renewable to 111 (d) we\u2019ll probably have a final rule there in summer, say August. The States will now have to start providing for the reality of compliance with that rule and therefore we got to start thinking about gas. And remember as I suggested earlier on the call if we\u2019re going to do new gas generation we need new gas infrastructure. Those things can go hand in hand and filling in that kind of flat spot. Shar Pourreza : And then just on any of the Southeast states, is anybody close to submitting the state implementation plan or we\u2019re like very far off? Tom Fanning : You don\u2019t have a final rule to react to. Shar Art just pointed something out. Why don\u2019t you stay with it on the solar? Art Beattie : If you look at our CapEx budget in terms of growth CapEx in 2017 it\u2019s like $200 million but solar projects so it\u2019s very, very small compared to '15, '16. Tom Fanning : So there is 200 million anyway, it\u2019s way less than what we\u2019re seeing right now. Operator : And our next question is coming from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Paul Ridzon : It seems incrementally with each call you\u2019re embracing more and more renewables. I mean if this trend continues what are your current thoughts about when yield come into serious consideration? Tom Fanning : So we\u2019re really following through on what we said we would do. It\u2019s funny. It\u2019s kind of what you say and how you say it, I guess. What we\u2019ve been saying here been pretty consistent for a while now that we thought that renewables will be important certainly solar renewables through '15 and '16 while you have the 30% investment tax credit environment, and that kind of beyond \u201816 into '17 and '18 where 30% goes to 10 all of a sudden wind starts looking like a way to address that gap. Also you should know the strategic synergy we started procuring wind energy via contract. So for us to take an equity position and win puts us in a different posture than we have been before. With respect to the YieldCo you know that we\u2019ll consider anything but I think on balance we felt that Southern Company itself was a YieldCo anyway we have really efficient ways to raise capital. I think it introduces complexity into your balance sheet and long-term I\u2019m not sure that north of the benefit of shareholders it certainly has short-term appeal but I would never want to impair the long-term viability of this company by doing financial engineering or tricks. The other thing you should just know and let\u2019s just point out again we haven't really talked about on this call but we have another call. We have terrific tax appetite and given our scale, given our tax appetite you know that we\u2019ve always been conservative; our tax appetite remains the competitive advantage for us to play in these fields. Linking that with our experience with the major vendors our low cost of capital, access the capital markets, I think the developers they want to do something significant look to Southern as the premier partner right now. That\u2019s why we have been able to fill up our [advance] card. Paul Ridzon : And then it was refreshing to see in the Kemper charge kind of immaterial this quarter, how you look there? Tom Fanning : Tell me about it. Look, we\u2019re in start up right now. There is a submission of construction left but we\u2019re essentially in start up, and the team there is working wonderfully. We brought in a guy that has had a tremendous amount of experience in start up of these types of processes Chip Troxclair, he and his team have really done a dynamite job of stay on the schedule and working around the issues. It\u2019s refreshing to us as well. They\u2019re doing a great job. Operator : Our next question is come from the line of Dan Jenkins from State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question. Dan Jenkins : First questions on Slide 18, your financing plan I notice there are couple of revisions from slide from last quarter the big ones being Alabama in '13 went from 713 to 75 and then Mississippi bank debt in '16 went from to 0 to 900. I was wondering if you could talk about what\u2019s driving those change? Art Beattie : I believe the Alabama took advantage and issues from vision of that this year. It actually did some refunding that probably wasn\u2019t reflected in the schedule we showed you on the last call. Mississippi bank debt was really a renewal of bank notes that were maturing this year that was about 775 million maturing this year and we actually renewed those plus a couple of hundred million or 175 million or so of additional money and really that's serving as bridge financing for until we get into position where we can either go to capital markets or do our securitization financing. Dan Jenkins : And I want to go back little bit on your retail sales growth. You talked about change in the weather normalized sales. So I was wondering if you could give us a little color on the customer growth how -- is consistent with your expectation or how is that playing out? Art Beattie : Yes, well we talked a little about customer growth in the residential side. We added 16,000 new I think last year we added 10 in the first quarter. So pretty good jump in growth. I think if you do a year-over-year look it's about 37,000 increase if you look at year what we have added since the first quarter of last year 37,000 you may recall that prior to the recession we were adding almost 60,000 or more a year, so it's not back to where it was but it' showing stronger growth. Dan Jenkins : Then last I was looking at the global construction update on Slide 5, I think it is then I noticed you didn't really change any of the information related to Unit 4, and I was wondering if that was according -- still according to plan or if there has been some slippage in the near-term and on the horizon are essentially the same as what you reported last quarter. Art Beattie : I don't have last quarter's slide in front of me but I believe that what you're seeing there is still kid of consistent with where we are the biggest new module, CA04 module is not a very big one neither are CD-65 or CD-66. So the next biggest module for the Unit 4 will be CA20 and we mentioned that in the script that is just now beginning assembling in the MAB the module assembling building. Dan Jenkins : So the schedule hasn't really changed for Unit 4 and then to what you reported last time? Art Beattie : Not that I'm aware. Operator : And at this time there is no further question. Mr. Fanning, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Yes. Thank you. Listen everybody we appreciate you been on the call. I think the company's is off to a great start as we've said to franchise for some time now has been in a good as shape as it's ever been. We continue to execute like champions and we're going to do our best to make sure that our shareholders here are handsomely rewarded. Thanks very much. Talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company's first quarter 2015 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon. My name is Savannah, and I will be your conference coordinator on today's call. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 29, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir. Daniel S. Tucker - Vice President, Investor Relations & Financial Planning : Thank you, Savannah. Welcome, everyone, to The Southern Company's second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning along with the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss on today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Our traditional operating companies continued to operate superbly in the second quarter of 2015, making great progress towards our full-year objectives. Contributing to this performance is underlying strength in retail electricity sales. For the first time in a decade, we've experienced two consecutive quarters of growth in all three retail customer classes : residential, commercial and industrial. In particular, we are encouraged by the developing strength of the residential sector, fueled in large part by healthy growth in the housing sector. Our wholesale subsidiary, Southern Power, also performed extremely well in the second quarter. Year-to-date results for Southern Power represent solid growth compared to 2014 and we expect them to exceed their plan for 2015, and the outlook for 2016 is promising. As we suggested last quarter, Southern Power has now confirmed solar and wind projects to account for all of its placeholder capital in 2015. The project pipeline remains robust and we could potentially exceed our forecasted placeholders for both 2015 and 2016. We continue to leverage our full portfolio of generation resources to deliver low-cost electricity for customers. With our coal burn near record lows, our natural gas consumption is increasing and our gas burn is expected to increase to an average of 1.8 Bcf per day this year. This compares with our average gas burn of 1.5 Bcf per day over the last three calendar years. We've also continued to grow renewable generation resources. Last week, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved Georgia Power's request to build a 46 megawatt solar project at the U.S. Marine Corp logistics base in Albany, Georgia. With this approval, Georgia Power now has 166 megawatts of solar generation under development on military bases in Georgia, which speaks to a strong partnership with the United States Department of Defense. Georgia Power also launched its new solar sales and installation service on July 1. Through a variety of solar programs, Georgia Power will add thousands of solar panels to the Georgia landscape for customers who desire that option. All of our traditional operating companies are now pursuing significant renewable generation projects, and Southern Power continues to grow its renewable portfolio. So, based on the currently approved project, The Southern Company system expects to own or purchase the output of more than 3,200 megawatts of renewable resources, including 46 solar facilities in seven states by the end of 2016. I would now like to focus our discussion on the two major construction projects, both very important to our full portfolio of generating resources. Georgia Power's new nuclear project, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and Mississippi Power's 21st century coal facility in Kemper County, Mississippi. First, an update on the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Construction is proceeding very well as the focus continues to be on quality and safety. We held our Southern Company Management Council meeting at the worksite last week, where our senior management team was able to observe progress firsthand. For Unit 3, final preparations are underway to set the 1,000-ton CA01 module in the containment vessel, which is expected to occur in early August. Assembly of the CA03 module has begun, and concrete placements continue in preparation for the initial installations of shield-building panels expected in the coming months. The Unit 4 nuclear island continues to benefit from lessons learned on Unit 3. Three of the smaller structural modules were recently installed, and assembly of CA20 has begun in the module assembly building. Significant work has also occurred in areas outside the nuclear island, including work on the structural steel for the Unit 3 annex building. The annex building will be a critical component in the initial energization testing that is anticipated in 2016, a key milestone in preparation for the eventual testing and startup of Unit 3. In ground work for the Unit 3 switchyard is also finished, and there has been significant progress on other transmission infrastructure. The Unit 3 cooling tower is complete, and the Unit 4 cooling tower is now more than 100 feet tall. Overall, we remain on target for the anticipated completion of Unit 3 in the second quarter of 2019 and Unit 4 in the second quarter of 2020. On the regulatory front, the Georgia Public Service Commission staff has recommended approval of costs submitted in the 12th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report, and we expect the Commission to render a decision on August 18. Now, let's turn to an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. Kemper start-up is also progressing with first syngas production expected later this year. Operator training is well underway and portions of the plant have been turned over to the operations team. Control system validation, an area of significant initial focus, is also on schedule to support these future milestones. Mississippi Power's continuing startup and checkout activity and, as expected with any project, is identifying and remediating issues along the way. In some cases, equipment is being repaired by the original equipment manufacturer, while in other cases, the engineering and construction team is implementing solutions onsite. To a large extent, contingencies for cost and schedule have been sufficient to absorb these activities, and the focus remains on the expected in-service date in the first half of 2016. I'll move now to a discussion of regulatory matters. Based on the Mississippi Public Service Commission's July 7 order, Mississippi Power has ceased billing customers for Kemper. As a result, Mississippi Power filed a rate proposal on July 10 for an 18% increase, primarily to recover costs associated with the project combined cycle and transmission investments, as well as Kemper-related regulatory assets. The combined cycle has been running since August of 2014 and performing exceptionally well. In fact, over the last 11 months, Kemper's combined cycle operations have delivered more than 3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity and saved Mississippi Power customers more than $15 million, having displaced other higher cost methods of generation. Year-to-date, this unit has experienced an equivalent forced outage rate or EFOR of approximately 1.25% compared with an industry average EFOR of over 6% for natural gas combined cycles. As the Commission is not expected to rule on any permanent rates for Kemper prior to November, Mississippi also petitioned the PSC to implement the 18% increase on an interim basis, subject to refund. A hearing on the interim rates is scheduled for August 6. At the same time, the PSC may also rule on Mississippi Power's proposed Mirror CWIP refund plan, which was filed in response to the July 7 order. I'll turn the call over now to Art for a financial and economic overview. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2015, reporting earnings of $629 million, or $0.69 a share, compared with earnings of $611 million, or $0.68 a share, in the second quarter of 2014. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, earnings were $1.14 billion, or $1.25 a share, compared with earnings of $962 million, or $1.08 a share, for the same period in 2014. Earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, include after-tax charges of $14 million and $20 million, respectively, related to increased construction estimates for Mississippi Power's Kemper County integrated gasification combined cycle project. Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2014, include after-tax charges of $235 million, or $0.26 a share, related to the Kemper County IGCC project. Earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 also include a $4 million after-tax charge related to discontinued operations of Mirant and the March 2009 settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery. Excluding these charges, Southern Company earned $647 million, or $0.71 a share, during the second quarter of 2015, compared with $611 million, or $0.68 per share, during the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $0.03 per share. For the first six months of 2015, excluding these charges, Southern Company earned $1.16 billion, or $1.28 per share, compared with earnings of $1.20 billion, or $1.34 a share, for the same period in 2014, a decrease of $0.06 a share. Earnings for the second quarter of 2015 were positively influenced by retail revenue effects at Southern Company's traditional operating companies, warmer weather and a stronger than expected performance from our Southern Power subsidiary. Earnings were negatively influenced by increased non-fuel O&M expenses. Moving on to an economic and sales review for the second quarter, as Tom just mentioned, we experienced weather normal growth in all three customer classes; residential, commercial, and industrial, in consecutive quarters for the first time since 2004. We are particularly encouraged by growth in the residential class, which saw weather normal sales increase 1.2% in the second quarter, largely a result of customer growth. We've added nearly 22,000 new residential customers through June of this year, which compares to just over 13,000 customers added during the same period in 2014, an increase of nearly 60% over last year and our 2015 forecast. Residential growth is shifting from absorption of vacant properties to new construction as 85% of our customer gains are from new connects. While not yet back to prerecession levels, new connects are 14% ahead of 2014, which further indicates a strengthening housing market and healthy migration into our service region. Between 2013 and 2014, Atlanta was ranked number four among U.S. cities with the highest net migration. Our commercial markets are continuing to show strength as well, with a second quarterly increase in weather adjusted sales of 0.7%. This growth is supported by strong non-manufacturing employment growth. Atlanta experienced the second fastest rate of job growth of the 12 largest metro areas in the U.S., and its office vacancy rate is at the lowest level since 2008. Earlier this month, we re-engaged with our Economic Roundtable, a group consisting of regional economists and executives from several of our largest customers that meets twice a year. The panelists expect GDP growth of approximately 2.5% for 2015. They also noted an improvement in the national housing market, which further supports what we are experiencing with migration to our region as homeowners are better able to sell their existing homes and relocate to higher growth job markets. Finally, our earnings estimate for the third quarter is $1.16 per share. I'll turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Art. Here at the midpoint of 2015, we continue to see a franchise business that is operating at a high level, and we see important progress on major capital projects. We also see a strengthening economy and a region poised for continued growth. Finally, Southern Power is on track to exceed its original financial targets. In short, we believe Southern Company is well-positioned for continued success in 2015 and beyond, behind the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to our customer-focused business model. We're now ready to take your questions. Operator, we'll now take the first question. Operator : Thank you. One moment, please, for the first question. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Greg. How are you? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Good. Good afternoon, fellows. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I know you guys usually only update guidance once a year at the beginning of the year, but you made a comment that you're feeling pretty good about where the financial performance stands year-to-date. Are you prepared to comment about how we look inside the guidance range for 2015? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No. Greg, we're going to keep doing what we've been doing for \u2013 gosh, I know this was ever since I was CFO, so this is over 10 years ago now. So, we provide initial guidance in January and then we always update kind of in October, once we get past the summer months. We'll just keep with that practice. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Fair enough. My second question was looking at the financing plan on page 12 of the slide deck, it actually looks like your total debt financing needs are slightly lower over the 2015 to 2017 time period, and you still are not projecting to need any equity. Is that plan sort of formally updated for the SMEPA refund and what you hope to get in terms of a decision in Mississippi with regard to the refunds there? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Greg, this is Art. Yes, it does. We have adjusted some of the operating company needs out of 2015 and reduced those, and then Southern Power has been on a small bit of adjustment as well, offset by some increases in the holding company level. But all-in-all... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Yeah. So, when you say you've reduced the needs of the operating companies, does that mean that there's more cash flow than you expected there? Or you've cut back on expected capital expenditures at the regulated businesses? Or does that mean there's just \u2013 you're modulating down, sort of the placeholder (19:38)... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. It's a combination of all that plus as you look into 2016, we pushed some out of 2015 into 2016, but if you net them all, it's a slight bit of an increase, not great. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. And can you guys just explain again specifically what it is that you're hoping to get from the Mississippi Commission on August 6? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : The 18% rate increase, for one, and then what is the preferred plan for the customer refund? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, sure. So, the simple answer is that we have a plan in place that amounts to about an 18% increase permanently for assets and service, including some amortizations of some regulatory assets. So, that amounts to 18%. We won't be able to have those rates put into place by the Commission until the process is complete, which we think now might be, who knows, November, something like that. So, the interim rates, we would expect to be put into place on or around August 6. That would permit us to basically keep the rate structures in place that have been in place minus the refunds. So, that's really the process. Number one, the interim rates equal to what we believe is the right kind of rates associated with assets and service. We think that'll be complete at the end of this year, November. And then, we will have the rest of the assets either ruled on by the end of the year, we don't know the answer to this, or conceivably pushed into 2016. That's associated with what we believe will be about a 10% looking number, 6% associated with securitization bonds, 4% associated with the other assets. In terms of the refund plan, our preference is to have a default that would be a bill credit. The customers could elect to take a check. All that would be complete within 90 days. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, guys. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Anthony, how are you? Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Wonderful. Never been better. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Awesome. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Just two quick questions. Unfortunately, they're with the small part of your business on Mississippi. One is, I think previously you were thinking you could get syngas entered into the unit in July, and maybe that's been pushed back. If you give some color on that. And the second question is related to, I guess, the staff recommendations in Mississippi that were released last Friday. The staff had recommended some conditions, two of them of interest, one was that an equity infusion of like, $200 million rather quickly, and also, the parent, Southern Company, guarantee investment grade credit at Mississippi Power through the duration of the project. I just wanted to know if you could maybe talk about those. Is that something the company is willing to entertain until they get full clarity on the entirety of the project? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let me take the first one on syngas. So, basically there's three or four big pieces that we need to do. One is that we're working on a syngas cooler super heater, the ash silo and the fluidization lines pressure testing. We're doing all those right now. Once we get those done, then we'll go through in-service pressure tests. We expect to complete all of that kind of by mid-August. So, that's very near term stuff. As well, there's something called a particular control device that basically takes the foreign matter, particulate matter, out of the flue gas. Then, we will move into the fluidization process. The first thing we will do is actually run the gasifier. This is kind of a new step we've put in place. We just think it's prudent, though. But, we will use sand to emulate the lignite particles and shapes. So, we're going to run sand through the gasifier. So, essentially the fluidization will be able to be demonstrated without the production of syngas. Putting that step in place, pushes actual syngas production out of lignite into the fourth quarter. So, that's roughly the schedule, kind of four or five kind of big things we're doing right now. We expect to be complete by mid-August. Then we start this simulated process with sand. Once we get that in place, then we'll do the lignite. So, these are all intentional, and we think it will serve us well as we continue to go through an orderly startup. Anthony, with respect to the second question, it really goes to the staff's recommendation. We have, Southern Company has stood behind everything we said we would do with respect to getting the plant built and started up. And that's what we're doing. And right now, there has been a staff recommendation. It's better, I think, for us not to comment particularly to any staff recommendation, certainly as any recommendation could relate to Southern Company. I think, we believe, that when you look at the issue at hand, that is rates for assets in service and those services have produce great value to Mississippi's customers, and they have been performing exceedingly well compared to any measure, we think we'll be treated fairly. And we expect constructive treatment out of the Commission not only for interim rates, but also for permanent rates related to those sets of assets, okay? Is there anything else that you wanted me to cover about that? Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : I guess, do you expect the, I guess, interim rates, and I know there's a window when the Commission has to approve interim rates and also maybe permanent rates. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Does that all get decided with the current Commission, or does that get decided maybe in 2016 when you have two new faces on the Commission? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We think that the 18% that we are seeking both in interim and permanent would be with this Commission. There are two paths that could happen on the remaining 10% or so. Remember, 6% of those 10% relate to securitization bonds, which does not involve any ROE to Mississippi Power. The only remaining kind of return elements to Mississippi Power is 4%. Now that could either happen this year based on a current filing or a new filing we might make, or it could be pushed into 2010, we'll just see. I mean, 2016. We'll just see where that goes. We believe that so far the plant, knock on wood, has been going great. The start's been going great. We've had some normal bumps in the road, but we've been able to handle them with the contingencies that we've had in place. And we're very happy with the performance of the team on-site. They're doing a heck of a job. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question, Tom. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Anthony. Good talking with you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Steve. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Tom. Thank you. Just one other thing, I know you just went through an extensive schedule on Kemper. I did, I think, when you commented on it, you said something to the effect of you are kind of to a large extent kind of within the contingency for it. And I just wanted to make sure I understood what messaging you are trying to say there. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Sure. Yeah. And thanks for the clarification. So, what I meant by that was remember when we, gosh, we took this reserve whenever we last changed the schedule into the first half of 2016. We basically provided for, I want to say about $30 million a month, and that included some contingency. And so, as I said in the kind of prepared remarks that that contingency is working and it speaks to whatever kind of unforeseen changes we've had to make, any work, rework, those kinds of things. The only when I said largely, the only thing I'm referring to really isn't schedule. It goes with these little small things that we've been showing, like, for example, a net increase this time of $14 million for the quarter. That's all we're referring to. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, maybe just also in your comments at the end on kind of happy with financial results, and maybe \u2013 I think you said maybe meet or exceed expectations? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I said that about Southern Power. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : So, that's on Southern Power? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And is that's due to the higher investments in renewables? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And just to review the bidding there, if you think about it in 2014, remember, we had, I forget, placeholders for three years, as we kind of typically do. And in 2014, we started seeing so much success, we accelerated those placeholders into 2014. And that produced better than expected results. And then remember when we set our financials this year, we said, we're going to replicate 2014 and 2015. In other words, 2014 results for 2015, and we're going to add some stretch. I'm telling you right now, I think we're going to beat our stretch targets for 2015 for Southern Power, and we said this on the last call, but it just continues to be true and perhaps further, that the placeholders are getting filled up for 2016. So, I'm feeling very confident about our ability for the placeholders in 2016; and in fact, potentially, can't guarantee it, but potentially there could be upside to even our expectations for 2016. By October, we may be able to shed even a little more light on both of those 2015 and 2016 issues, but let's wait until the next earnings call, where we'll have a little more transparency. But, we're feeling very good about our progress and executing. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. But, I guess, my only question then on that is, if that becomes \u2013 what happens then in 2017 if we don't have an ITC anymore or I guess it's smaller... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : ...does that become a big headwind? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Not a headwind. And we've talked about this before, and it was the shape of, kind of, earnings. So, I think this would largely be true for most folks and that is, absent solar investment tax credits which go from 30 to 10, you would generally expect to see a flattening out of earnings from \u2013 you'd love to see, so we're telling you, we're seeing a really good picture. The franchise is doing great. The power is doing great. You're going to see a trajectory in 2015 and 2016. All things being equal, the solar credits go away or at least go to 10, you'd see some flattening of progress, especially if people try to push stuff into 2016 to get it done, so 2016 to 2017 could flatten out a little bit. One of the things though that we're working on is ways to fill in what we're calling that divot, and that divot could be filled in with some win projects. We announced earlier Kay Wind, there's some other things we're looking at. As you know, they have a different earnings profile associated with their production tax credit. It's a 10-year kind of deal. And so, we're working on ways right now to improve what 2017 may look like, assuming you don't get an extension on the solar credits. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with the question. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Dan. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Just, Tom, could we just talk a little bit about EPA and the CPP and I guess, a, whether you think the stories are right that it's going to come next week and then kind of, what adjustments you guys think are going to make it into the final rule? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so, Dan, it's anybody's guess at this point. When EPA pushed forward the preliminary rule and they got, gosh, over four million comments, I think they themselves realized that the proposed rule has some significant flaws, and I think we've been working constructively with EPA to try and fix those flaws. Been a number of kind of important areas that we look forward to EPA addressing. For example, one that's been just widely discussed is the so-called cliff date of 2020, so we would look for EPA to provide some flexibility. My sense is, they're likely going to keep teeth in the 2030 requirement, but we could see some flexibility on 2020. Who knows? EEI certainly has put forth a recommendation for that. Other issues could be related to current non-carbon-emitting resources. It could be life extensions of nukes, it could be increases of capacity of nukes, it could be our own Vogtle 3 and 4, which originally we didn't get credit for, that somehow EPA would recognize that that absolutely meets the intention of reducing carbon. And really it goes to Kemper County and actually other things. There's a host of other issues, Dan, that could be considered. You hear about energy efficiency requirements, you hear about the original methodology that EPA took to determine, kind of, the renewable capacity of certain states. But for me to say, where they're going to come out on those issues, again, would be pure conjecture. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. I guess next question, Tom, is just, Toshiba is the economic backstop to CBI and Westinghouse on Vogtle, and given kind of all their troubles they've incurred so far, A, is that having any effect on how Westinghouse is behaving on the project itself? And then B, what is your source of recourse if Toshiba has problems or if they sell down their interest in Westinghouse to make sure your protections stay in place? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we have an awfully strong contract, number one, and remember our contract is very different in its makeup than what you see at the summer project for SCANA. So, our contract is typically viewed as a turnkey, fixed-price deal. And actually, we've improved it over the construction cycle that we've experienced so far. So, that's kind of number one. Number two is, when you think about just the commercial incentives for CBI, for Westinghouse, and even Toshiba, the best thing they can do to improve their own financial integrity is to perform under the contract, so that's important. Number three, I know there's been some trade press about Toshiba's ability to execute given that they've had some negative publicity. In 2013, Westinghouse took appropriate charges for many of these issues. Those issues are behind Westinghouse. To the extent there is a double, a two-notch downgrade at Toshiba's level, then they would post in LOC, we think they have the ability to do that. So, the contract provides us protection. Incentives, even in the event of tremendous turmoil, would always direct them to perform under the contract. And then finally, to the extent there are downgrades, the contract provides for Toshiba to post a letter of credit. We think they have the ability to do that. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. And I guess just one last question. Can you remind how you guys think about M&A from a corporate strategy perspective and how you prioritize that relative to other uses of capital? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely. Yeah. We've talked about this a lot and nothing's changed. Essentially, and we've talked about it in the past in terms of thinking about this kind of long-term trajectory we're on, as our CapEx program starts to wind down, I think this year we're $6.8 billion in CapEx, and next year $5.5 billion, and the year after that, $4.3 billion. I think those are the numbers, round numbers. When you think about that, the consequence is that EPS starts to slow, and we've talked about that. And then, we said there's a shape to that; in other words, EPS growth should resume once you get into the next decade and you reach capacity, equilibrium in the region as well. There could be new CapEx associated with environmental law as well there could be new CapEx associated with 111(d). So, kind of on its own, we think the curve resumes. In the interim, as we see CapEx winding down, we see cash flow growing immensely. And what we've said is during this period of immense cash flow, certainly compared to our recent history, Southern actually looked a little over equitized. So, we've said that on several earnings calls. So, what do we do about that? We've often talked about three options. The first, simplest option is to buy back your own shares. The second option is kind of at the other end of the spectrum, is to buy somebody else's shares. And we always said that would require a premium and you would have to demonstrate a likelihood of recovery of the premium through increased value to shareholders. And in the middle has been just buying assets. And frankly, we've been doing that. If you look at kind of Southern Power's performance, we certainly have exceeded our own expectations on our ability to execute asset purchases, particularly in solar and wind. So, we've done that very successfully. So, those are really the options I would cover. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Stephen, how are you? Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Very well, thank you. Thanks for your time. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Most of my topics have been covered. I just wanted to hit on new nuclear briefly and check in on the Chinese project at Sanmen. Anything notable in terms of development there since the last quarter? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Not really. With respect of new nuclear at Georgia, what I said was we were going to call a timeout on pushing that one forward until we got this dispute resolved from a commercial standpoint. Recall, what we've said in the past is the dispute isn't so much with us anymore, it's kind of among and between the contractors, so we look forward for them to kind of constructively resolve their own issues, and then I think we can deal with them in a constructive way. So, let's see how that goes. With respect to Sanmen, I think the most important thing there is, there's been a lot of conversation about this reactor coolant pump issue. That's not a critical path issue for us, and it looks as if, they have made a successful resolution of some of the design issues, so that will accrete to our benefit. So, it's going fine. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. That's all I had. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey. How are you doing, Michael? Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm all right, Tom. Congrats on a good first half of the year. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, sir. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: When you think about Southern Power, about how \u2013 how do you think about the maximum, meaning how big would you want Southern Power to be relative to the overall, and whether that impacts how you think about whether there are \u2013 whether under different umbrellas, Southern Power might have even greater growth opportunities, if there is such a cap? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, hey, that's a great question. That's something we actually talk about. Yeah, right now, they're about 8% of Southern. And you probably remember from prior discussions, but just to review for everybody's benefit, the way we structure Southern Power is to essentially replicate the kind of credit profile, risk profile, that we had at Southern. That is, as apart from any merchant investment, long-term bilateral contracts, durations of 14 years or so, creditworthy counterparties, we don't take fuel risks, we don't take transmission risks, so it kind of has the feel from a portfolio risk standpoint as does the rest of our franchise business. Now, the question you raised is a very interesting one and that is, how high is too high, or is our appetite? I think you could easily kind of double Southern Power relative to the rest of Southern Company and still, I think, stay within our appetite, but that would be pushing it. Somewhere in the 15% of net income range. But there again, we'd have to see what the nature of those investments are, our tax appetites, all that stuff. We'd have to review that, but that's what I would roughly say, relative to where we are now, we could still double it and remain within our appetite. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Somebody asked a question earlier about the EPA, and I wanted to ask you what \u2013 and obviously there's a lot of wood to chop when it comes to the upcoming carbon rules, state implementation plan designs, et cetera. How are you thinking about what the impact of other potential rules that haven't been finalized are, say maybe ozone... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...and what that means both for the CapEx profile and for the cost to customers and the timeline for implementation, and whether it's ozone or some other rule that I'm not thinking of? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Nah, but listen, it's an excellent thought, because one of the problems that \u2013 well, let me start out with, I've been very public on this one. The body that has the same kind of lens we do, that is to balance the important objectives for our customers, a clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy, is Congress. I think with all the best of intentions EPA doesn't have the ability to assess, I think they get clean, but they don't have the ability to assess in a balanced way, safe, reliable, and affordable. It's not what they do. And so, when we think about long-term implications of a regulator like EPA, putting out piecemeal the regulation, it is an important fact to note that the so-called pancaking of these various regulations are not particularly well-coordinated in balancing the overall energy portfolio of the United States. That's why I've always said, we need kind of a consistent national energy policy, and I think we've got great leadership there. Fred Upton in the House, Lisa Murkowski in the Senate, these are terrific leaders of the United States, and I think they've got all of our best interests at heart in balancing these important issues. The other issue that's just kind of interesting to think about along these lines, I would have gone to the \u2013 the Hatch/Max, now Matt's issue, the remand to the D.C. District Court. And depending on what they do, they could send it back to EPA for clarification on how did they take cost into account. Well, the practical matter is, as this industry complied in good faith to that kind of far-reaching regulation, we've already spent billions of dollars. We've started closing plants, we've eliminated jobs and tax base, we've done all sorts of things. The regulation remains in place, even though it's being revisited. It's important, I think, to learn as a lesson that whenever you evaluate the far-reaching implications of some of these regulations, we need to get all this right out of the gate as opposed to after the fact. So, that would be kind of my big lessons learned. One is thinking about the pancake effect. We've got to think about it in an integrated way. Number two, we've got to get all those clean, safe, reliable, affordable factors considered before we implement. And three, I'd love to see national energy policy enacted by Congress. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carrie Saint Louis with Fidelity (46:11). Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Carrie (46:12). Unknown Speaker : Hi. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Super. How are you? Unknown Speaker : I'm doing fine. So, I just wanted to touch base on a little bit more on the capital raising and Mississippi Power. So, looking at the slides, it looks like you guys have put some bank debt in at Mississippi Power? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. That was true, Carrie (46:38). This is Art \u2013 back in the spring. About $900 million. Yeah. Unknown Speaker : What was the decision behind that? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, again, it was renewing some bank loans that were already outstanding and we added a little bit to it at the same time. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Does that... Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, these are to serve as a bridge until we get some clarity on regulatory issues or to the point where we can issue securitization bonds and take that debt out. Unknown Speaker : Okay. But is it like a general term loan? Are you deciding that you're not going to issue in the public market at Mississippi Power until there's a little bit more regulatory clarity? Or just what was the decision to use that type of funding versus public market issuance? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. That's absolutely true. With so much on the clarity side... Unknown Speaker : Right. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's a problem. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, we're trying to do it as best we can. And again, the banks are worried about security as well. So, it's not just the public markets. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think just from a structural standpoint, too, if we believe that securitization bonds are in the near-term future, bank debt to bridge to that is an efficient way to finance. Yeah. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then just two other quick questions. On The Southern Company, the $1 billion of issuance this year, why are you issuing so much up at the parent this year versus prior years? It seems like a lot of issuance, I think it's $1.6 billion overall. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. These are remaining amounts, and a lot of that is to cover the cash needs at all of our Southern subs for the capital that we might be providing to them. And it also covers some of the Mississippi Power needs related to the refund and it will be provided in the form of an intercompany loan. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then turning to equity, so there still looks like there's no contemplation of increased equity issuance at the company? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That is our current plan. We continue to manage our portfolio over the long-term. Things change, but Southern Power, if they keep executing on their plan to the upper limits, there could be additional needs in that regard. But it depends on where we are with cash and where we see the future CapEx going for the entire business. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And, Carrie (49:10), let me just jump in on this one. If you look at our CapEx plan going into 2017, you see the drop from $6.8 billion to $4.3 billion. We're throwing off cash. So, it would be kind of silly for us to issue equity and then in turn repurchase it two years later. Unknown Speaker : Yeah. I guess just the concern I have is that your S&P put the whole complex, Southern and all OpCos on review for downgrade. And I guess that was done during this last quarter. So, I guess, and I don't want to read anything into it, but I would have thought that maybe you would like to maintain your ratings there. So, I guess, you're not, I guess, your comment is that you're not looking to issue equity to defend current credit rating. Is that a fair comment, or how should I think about that? I would have thought maybe you'd use a little bit more discretion about future equity, but it seems like you're saying not necessary. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've got to run this business in the long-term. And I think the S&P move was all about Mississippi, to be honest with you. And I'm assuming that we're going to get fair treatment with the interim rates and then the permanent rates. Unknown Speaker : Right. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, I think we just need clarity around that process. Unknown Speaker : So are you, if somehow in Mississippi things don't go as expected with the outcome for interim rate relief, is there a view that you would be open to considering issuing equity? Or are you saying that that's just not in the plans regardless? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, look, I mean, we're open to anything, to be honest with you. But we expect fair treatment. I think we have a compelling case for fair treatment. I don't expect anything other than that. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So... Unknown Speaker : Well, I appreciate that. I think openness to equity is always constructive. So, thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, Tom. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Awesome. How are you? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I'm okay. Quick question. You said you thought that at this point the Vogtle dispute was among the consortium. Kind of what residual risk do you see Georgia Power still wearing here? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, I think Georgia Power has demonstrated that they are very well protected via their contract. Residual risk, to me, I suppose there's some theoretical risk there. But, as a practical matter, when you think about even with the schedule changes, even with the increases in costs associated with those schedule changes, we believe that the, call it the majority of the cost, the big majority of the costs associated with that is being borne by the contractors. And that's being demonstrated over and over again. And in fact, when you think about the fact that when Georgia had this plant certified, everyone thought that the cost was going to be a 12% price increase to Georgia Power's customers. Because the benefit has overwhelmed the increases in cost, we think now that estimate, frankly, Paul, has actually improved this quarter, as you see in the VCM12 filing. So, now we think we're in the bottom of the 6% to 8% range. Largely, this recent improvement is because we're financing at a much better rate than what even we thought when we got the federal loan guarantees. You know remaining kind of risk, I think we've disclosed in prior quarters, one of the features of the contract is called a financial integrity payment. It basically provides that as the contractors perform their obligations, if they use up all of their profit and then they spend another $250 million above their profit, I guess it's above their cost, then we would share a $250 million segment, of which our share of that would be about $114 million. And then everything above that would be for the account of the contractors guaranteed by Toshiba. That's been a part of the contract since day one. That's probably it in my view other than certain owner's costs and everything else. But that's about it. I think we're in terrific shape on the contract. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for that. And then do you \u2013 just back to Southern Power and how big it could be, do you think that Southern Power should be valued any differently than the utility? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Man, haven't we thought about that over the years? I know you've over the years thought about and I thought about it, too. Remember at one time all the infrastructure guys were buying up all these bilateral contracted entities, and they had tremendous value. We actually thought about that, and please understand from my background as a CFO, I know Art feels this way, we're always after shareholder interests, and so theoretically, you're always a buyer and a seller at a certain price. We're always there to do what's best for shareholders. If there's a better owner, we'll take advantage of it. The other thing, though, it's not just a dollars and cents business. There's real blood and guts and relationships in this stuff. When you think about kind of the relationship that Southern Power has been able to strike in the marketplace, and this is really important, because it goes through the center of our business model. Customers in the middle of everything we do, reliability, price, and service, one of the most loyal customer groups that Southern Power has are co-ops and municipals. They absolutely have a long-term view on these kinds of assets and what service may be provided for their customers. So, I'm not sure, we'd have to think very hard about ever selling those kinds of relationships away from the franchise. And that's other considerations we'd have to take into account. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. And sorry to switch subjects, but over to Mississippi, you said you expect a fair outcome. I assume that you would not consider the staff rack to be a fair outcome? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I just don't even want to comment on the staff rack. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Understood. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Appreciate you being on. Are there any other questions? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Hey. Afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Afternoon to you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. So, I wanted to go back a little bit to some of these balance sheet questions first. In terms of talking about future equitization, you talked pretty bullishly about your balance sheet, but obviously you've got the pressures from the credit rating agencies kind of in a more immediate sense. How do you think about that contingency level that you guys obviously baked in earlier, especially relative to some of the pressures that you alluded to before with Carrie (56:59)? If you can quantify it, perhaps, is really kind of what I'm getting at. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, it's kind of difficult to do that when you've got issues like Southern Power trying to execute on plans and you don't really have a good idea. But, what we're thinking about from a rating agency perspective is basically getting to a point where we can use, we can reduce the business risk, excuse me \u2013 increased financial risk because business risk will be reduced as we move out of these construction projects. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me say it a different way. Value is a function of risk and return. And when you make \u2013 I think the heart of your question gets into a bunch of current unknowables, what's going to happen with balance (57:45) depreciation and therefore cash flow, what's going to be the success rate of Southern Power, what's going to be our appetite to do things like gas infrastructure? So, there's a host of things that we just can't get our arms around. What I can tell you is as internal risk starts to wind down, that is we get more resolution on Kemper, that is we get more wind down of construction programs and therefore financing pressure, it's clear to me that as internal risk subsides, cash flow improves, that we can probably think differently about our capital structure. That's why we've said for some time now that in fact we may believe in the future, we may be over equitized a bit. So, I can't put a number on it, but these are things that we talk about daily. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. And well, perhaps just to come back to it a little bit, you've alluded to scaling up the relative size of Southern Power within the Southern family here, but how do you think about potentially monetizing these assets? Obviously given the ITC recognition and the subsequent earnings in future years and obviously your co-ownership with certain fuel-cos, do you think about potentially sort of recycling the capital rather than necessarily scaling up the business per se? In particular, if you're going to hit limit the max you say at 15% or what have you, in the context of Southern Power? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Think about the kind of CapEx that would be associated with doubling Southern Power right now. That is a big number, okay? So I think the chances, and you think about how big Southern is, and you think that Southern continues to grow, if you think about what's going to be required to double Southern Power that is a big number. So number one, boy, that's an outside bet. Number two, I've been pretty consistent in saying, if there's a better owner, we'd certainly take advantage of it. We'd always do that. But taking into account historical relationships, long-term partnerships, all those sorts of things. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a great option to have. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Heck, yeah. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Maybe let me just ask it more bluntly. To what extent would you pursue that as a first option, rather than issuing equity in maybe kind of near-term sense to address balance sheet concerns? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : If I'm a better owner of the asset and I have investment opportunities to issue equity, I would certainly issue the equity and make the investments that I need to make. I don't think about issuing equity in and of itself as being a bad thing. Number one, I'm over equitized, so I've got some margin there. Number two, if I'm above my kind of EVA threshold, then I issue equity and create value. So, I don't look at issuing equity as a bad thing. If I'm issuing equity, it must mean that all other things being equal, I've got darn good value-enhancing investments to make. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : That's very fair. And let me come back to one \u2013 something you alluded to in your comments previously here on gas infrastructure. Where do you stand on those opportunities? You've kind of suggested there could be updates coming, but where do we stand today? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, a lot, a lot, a lot of activity. I am not prepared to give you an update today, only because I got a lot of irons in the fire and I got to see how those things resolve themselves. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Well with that, best of luck with those irons. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, sir. We appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ali, how are you? Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : I'm doing well. Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon to you. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : First question, Tom. As you've mentioned, your weather-normalized sales through the first half are up 0.8%. As I recall, your full-year target was 1.3%. Is that still the target given where we've been through the first half? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Ali, this is Art. It still is. We don't adjust our targets that we put into our initial plans. But again, the momentum that we're seeing is beginning to approach what we've set out. We're certainly not there, but it was kind of forecast that way as well. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The signals we're seeing are really bullish. And if you look at kind of the national statistics, I'm sure the things the Fed is dealing with right now, we're seeing the same stuff they are. This residential move we've seen has been really bullish for us. We're not far away from where we were pre-recession on migration into our area and increasing customers. We're probably, I don't know, we think are about 70%, 80% of the way there? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : More like 60%, but... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, what are we expecting for the year 44,000 customers? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : In those days we were 55 to 60? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, so whatever percentage that is. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. Yeah. And then secondly, perhaps to you Art again, as you look at your O&M ramps again through the first half, I know you had talked about having some catch-up to do. Are we where you thought we should be on the O&M front, and again just remind us how we should think about that O&M this year and then going forward? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we're exactly what you said, we're right on target, even though year-over-year it looks like we're spending more money. And it is, a lot of that is driven by a couple of things. We've had more outages at our larger operating companies this year, last year as a comparison... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And planned outages. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And planned outages from a \u2013 into the tune of maybe $0.03 year-over-year. There is regulatory deferrals in Alabama in 2014 that you don't have in 2015, and that's about another $0.03. And then for other changes that we're seeing it's about another $0.06, so we're right in target. That deferral I mentioned at Alabama will reverse itself at year-end. So, when you get to year-end, we should be right on target with what we talked about at 3%, at 3.5% growth in non-fuel O&M. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And that's the run rate to think about going forward as well? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Yeah. And lastly, Tom, just clarifying the Vogtle dispute with the contractors, from your perspective, I know in the past you've alluded to the fact that if the other side is willing, there may be a settlement to be had where you give up some, they give up some and you move forward. Is that still an option or am I hearing that things are now going in a different direction, that they themselves are not sure where to go, or is that still something we should keep an eye on? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think it's something to keep an eye on. Look, we're always looking for a successful resolution. Failing a settlement, we're going to end up in court in Augusta, Georgia, to litigate around the commercial disputes. So, I think once the contractors resolve their own differences, we'll be in a position to address in a constructive way how to settle this thing. I'm an optimist, but I think it's reasonable optimism. I think we have a basis to go forward. But, they've got to resolve their own differences first. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Got it. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I have a really sort of quick question, I guess. Now that you guys are further along in the project and what have you, what do you guys estimate the cost of turning the lignite into gas is on just an operational basis? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So, when I answer that one, Paul, I generally think about it as a net energy price equivalent to gas to Mississippi's customers. Now... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : In NBT (65:56) you mean? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, let me give it to you on what it used to be and we'll project, we'll get an estimate on what it is now. So, recall that our ability to stand behind our construction overruns has preserved largely the capital cost economics to Mississippi's customers. When I think about the relative lack of volatility of lignite fuel supply into the plant, so we control all that fuel, there's almost no volatility relative to natural gas. Now remember the net cost is really net of also sales of by-products, which include sulfuric acid, ammonia, and CO2. The biggest issue there is CO2. At $100 a barrel, so this obviously isn't the case today, at $100 a barrel, remember, the CO2 revenues are indexed to oil. The net energy price was equivalent to about $1.25 per million BTUs, somewhere in that range. Now with oil prices being down, the net energy price would be up, so let say it's, I don't know, call it $2.50. If $100, and call oil $50, and I'm being kind of broad brush here, but say it's $2.50 per million BTUs, somewhere in there. So, my sense is gas today is, what, $2.82, somewhere in there, last I saw? You're still going to compete favorably with natural gas with this plant. It'll be by all reasonable estimates a base load facility, and for those economics, recall it has almost no volatility. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So, let me just understand this. So, what you're saying is with the CO2 being used to extract oil, is that what you mean? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's right. Remember, we sell it under contract at Tellus and Denbury... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ...and we get paid revenue for what would otherwise be a waste stream. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Because it's indexed to oil, and as a result, obviously those numbers have changed, but even with them changing on an operational basis, you guys see all the reagents, all the energy you have to put into it, et cetera, the extraction is basically approximately $2.50, give or take. Is that right? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That was a broad estimate, okay? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't have in the top of my head what ammonia's worth, what sulfuric acid is worth. It assumes a heat rate, it assumes a variety of things. But that would be, as I sit here right now, it would be a reasonable estimate. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And you see this as dispatching pretty much... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Once it's up and running. We're not going to have a situation where you're just going to be running natural gas through the CCGT because it's more economic? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I wouldn't think so, no. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. That's it. I mean, you've answered all my other questions. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, sir. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Thanks a lot. Have a good one. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. You too. Appreciate you being on. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Dan. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi. Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : How are you doing, bud? Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Pretty good. I have a couple related to the economy. You mentioned how you're seeing a rebound or a pickup in the residential and commercial areas, but I noticed that on the industrial it seemed it was a little slower than what we've seen in the last few months. I'm wondering if you have any more color on that. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Sure. Look, it's been consistent with kind of what the Fed has been seeing, it's what everybody's been kind of speculating, me included. Gosh. As the dollar has gained in strength relative to the euro, and when we think about what's going on in China and everything else, the United States economy, like it or not, may be the best place for people to invest, including Treasuries. Therefore, the strength of the dollar has really increased. And one of the dilemmas that the Fed is trying to deal with is that they start on a path to lift off, if you will, and then depending on what trajectory they select, you could see further strengthening of the dollar relative to other international currencies, and obviously that could have an impact on exports, okay? We've seen already some of that happen. So, when you think about the Grexit, whether it happens are not, Japan, China, like I said, event risk in the Soviet Union or in the Middle East, the dollar still looks pretty darn good. So, we've seen some slowdown in exports. Likewise, we've seen an increase in imports. The other thing that's kind of weighed on the industrial activity a little bit is oil prices. As oil prices being so low, we've seen kind of a reduction of bid in the pipelines, some manufacturing, things like that. Primary metals are down a little bit, chemicals are down a little bit, also, in this whole mix. So, that's what you're seeing. That's what's responsible for some of that. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Good. I also had a question, another question kind of related to the changes you've made to the financing plan. You know, overall it has, the three-year total didn't change much, but it looks like the 2015's about were $445 million lower, whereas 2016's $475 million higher. But you're still talking about the same CapEx numbers? So, should we maybe \u2013 is that more related to maybe some CapEx getting delayed into 2016 that was in 2015? Or how should we think about that year-over-year change related to the CapEx forecast? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Dan, it really is a function of cash flows within the operating companies, how they change, what their needs might be, whether they can push an issuance out of one year into the next. Again, we try to balance from a Southern Company perspective, who's going to market, when they go to market, so that we don't all go at the same time. So, we're just trying to balance out as we move through time how we tap the markets in the most efficient way. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then lastly on Vogtle, you didn't really breakout the Unit 3 and Unit 4 like you have in the past. And so, I'm just curious, just looking into this current quarter, the third quarter, it sounds like setting the Unit 3 say one is one of the critical items. I was wondering if you could identify any of the other critical items in Unit 3 and Unit 4 in this upcoming quarter. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the near term, you hit it, would be to set the CA01 in Unit 3. There are some other things going on there, the transmission work that we mentioned, I believe, in the script. That ops building, as Tom mentioned as well, is very, very important to us. The one other thing that's really not mentioned here, which is really down on the horizon part of Unit 3, it's the installation of the turbine generator, which I believe is late this year, early next, I believe. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's right. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Which is a big deal. And that turbine building has probably another 60 feet of steel to go on top once that turbine deck's built. So, if you look at the pictures we put in the slide deck, it's beginning to look like what it's going to look like at the end of the day. And that's exciting for us. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And you know what, I'll just make the invitation, I know certain of you guys have taken investors on to the site to be able to see this stuff, the scale of this work is just immense. And in order to kind of get an appreciation for it, if you guys maybe want to come see it, we'd be glad to arrange any kind of visit you want. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. How about Unit 4? Are there any critical items in this quarter [c there? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Dan. I think they set some smaller modules in, but the real big work there is going to be modular related. The CA20 assembly has begun in the modular assembly building. And they've begun making panels for the CA01 module at Unit 4 as well. So, those are big deals. We've learned a lot of lessons from Unit 3, and we're hopefully to going to put those lessons to use and build them quicker on Unit 4. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And the other thing that I guess I come away with when I go out there and kick the tires on the side, listen to the people building it, we're actually feeling pretty good about the schedule on Unit 2. There's a lot of element \u2013 I'm sorry, Unit 4. There's a lot of elements on Unit 4 that relative to Unit T3 are accelerated. That's good for the project. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, sir. Operator, are there any more questions? Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. I just want to say thank you to everybody. We had a heck of a first half of the year. The franchise is doing fabulous. We're coming off a year where we were the highest level of customer satisfaction, that's our ultimate barometer. But financially, we're great; operationally, we're great. Southern Power's doing fine. Making big progress on these big projects. I'm very happy to report a really good first six months and look forward to the next six months. Thank you all for being on the call. Thank you for following us, and look forward to talking with you soon. Have a great afternoon. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude The Southern Company's second quarter 2015 earnings call. We thank you for participating in today's call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Julian, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, Wednesday, October 28 of 2015. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Daniel S. Tucker - Senior Vice President of Finance, Treasurer: Thank you, Julian, and welcome everyone to Southern Company's third quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well with the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss on today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. As you can see from the earnings materials we released this morning and the announcement we made last night, we have a lot of good news to share today. First, our traditional operating companies continue to operate superbly in the third quarter of 2015 and they're on track to deliver on their financial targets for 2015. Second, Southern Power also performed exceptionally well in the third quarter, exceeding our expectations. So, so far this year, Southern Power has announced 12 new renewable projects with an ownership stake in these facilities of just over 1000 megawatts. Third, we've entered into an agreement to settle the commercial litigation associated with Vogtle units 3 and 4 and better position the project for the remaining months of its construction. And four, we achieved a major technical milestone in our Kemper facility with outstanding initial results in the fluidization testing phase of start-up. In a few moments Art will discuss the drivers of our third quarter performance in more depth and provide our earnings estimate for the remainder of the year. Let's now discuss the project \u2013 I mean the progress on Vogtle and Kemper in more detail. First, an update on Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. As you may have seen in our disclosures, we've agreed on terms to resolve the outstanding litigation with our EPC contractors. As we've shared previously on these calls, we believe the main obstacle to resolving these issues outside of court was the disagreement that existed among and between the contractors themselves. In a major move to resolve these disagreements, Westinghouse has agreed to purchase Stone & Webster, the AP1000 construction arm of CB&I and consortium partner in our EPC contract. Under the proposed transaction, Westinghouse and its affiliates would serve as the prime contractor for the project. Not only is this expected to make activities more efficient at the work site, it would also remove a lingering concern about contractor financial stability. Contemporaneous with that transaction's closing, we will agree to settle our commercial dispute. The proposed settlement contains the following key terms : first, all open claims, including any potential extension of those claims as well as future claims that could have been asserted under the original terms of the EPC agreement, will be dismissed. This includes the ongoing litigation in Augusta, Georgia. Second, the EPC agreement will be amended to restrict the contractors' ability to seek further increases in the contract price by limiting changes which constitute NRC changes in law. Third, the guaranteed substantial completion dates in the EPC agreement will be extended to June 30, 2019 for Unit 3 and June 30, 2020 for Unit 4, consistent with the current project construction schedule. In exchange for these benefits, Georgia Power has agreed to pay approximately $350 million. The cash impact of this amount are as follows : $121 million has already been paid as Georgia Power's share of disputed invoices; $114 million is to be paid upon the finalization of the agreement; and $114 million has been structured as milestone and incentive payment, heavily weighted to fuel load in December of 2018 and December of 2019. We are very pleased with these terms as they would achieve several key very important objectives. First, these terms reaffirm our current schedule and incentivize the contractor to meet it. Second, the term streamline resource deployment by removing inefficient contractor interaction. Third, it should reduce the risk associated with potential future claim. And four, these terms reinforce how well the EPC contract protects customers. In fact, customer rate impact for Vogtle units 3 and 4 even with this settlement are projected to be well within the previously disclosed range of 6% to 8%. In fact, our current projection, including the settlement, is less than 7%. With 4.5% already in Georgia Power's rate, this suggests that the rate increases through the completion of the project will be less than 2.5%. Moreover, the proposed settlement amount is significantly less than the amount of the contractor claims in the current litigation, which only includes their estimated cost for approximately 21 months of delay. Without a settlement, the contractors could have asserted additional claims, including their estimated cost for all or some portion of up to 18 months of further delays. As a part of the settlement, we also sought additional protection from similar lawsuits in the future. We believe the proposed amendment to the change in law provisions of the EPC contracts are perhaps the most significant element of the agreement. So, again, we are gratified to have reached this agreement which, with a proposed settlement cost of approximately $350 million, we believe that this proposed settlement is exceedingly favorable for customers and for the overall success of the project. The Georgia PSC has been briefed on key terms of the agreement. Their initial reaction was positive and they understand that it removes a significant overhang. Georgia Power will submit the ultimate settlement agreement and related amendments to the EPC agreement to the PSC for a more detailed review. Finally, as anticipated on our last call, we achieved several major milestones this last quarter for Vogtle units 3 and 4. The most notable was the placement of the CA01 module in Unit 3. Located inside the containment vessel, this module will house the steam generators. At 2.3 million pounds, this was the heaviest lift to-date on the project. We also began installing the first of many shield-building panels for Unit 3 and we installed the CA04 module for Unit 4. This module will ultimately have the reactor vessel for Unit 4, which is already on site. Let's turn now to an update on the Kemper County facility. During our earnings call one year ago, we announced that the combined cycle was in service and that the remaining construction schedule for Kemper had been extended into the first half of 2016 and that we plan to take a very methodical approach to the completion and start-up of the remainder of that facility. Today, those decisions are benefiting the entire project. The combined cycle has been performing exceptionally well for more than a year, providing some $23 million in energy savings for Mississippi Power customers. The gas plant has been operating with an equivalent forced outage rating of less than 1%, compared with an industry average of more than 6%. We are also well under way with major start-up activities. Last week, we began fluidization trials on the first of the two gasifiers. As a reminder, the fluidization test is a process in which sand is used as a substitute for lignite in order to test the flow of solids through the gasifier vessel. Not only does this process validate a critical component and scale-up of these technologies, but it also allows the operations team to test and fine-tune control systems beyond what is possible with simulators. We are extremely pleased with the results so far. In fact, the tests are going even better than what we expected; and we will take valuable lessons learned into the testing of the second gasifier later this year. In addition, we plan to conduct final commissioning of our lignite preparation systems over the next several weeks and begin the cure-out process for the gasifier refractory in preparation for the first production of syngas. As disclosed yesterday in our 8-K, we've increased the estimated cost subject to cost cap by approximately $150 million. Approximately $60 million of this amount has been incurred to address issues identified through our start-up and checkout process, as well as to help prepare the plant to operate more reliably with either lignite or natural gas. These efforts have positioned the project for the success we are experiencing today with the major start-up activities. The remainder of the increased cost is for additional schedule contingencies we expect to incur with an in-service still scheduled for the first half of 2016, consistent with our previous and current disclosure. As we've said many times in the past, we will not take shortcuts or sacrifice safety in order to expedite completion of the plant, and we remain committed to providing a world-class generating facility for customers. Finally, with respect to regulatory matters in Mississippi, our immediate focus is on getting permanent rates in place for the assets already placed in service. Hearings are scheduled to begin November 10, and we expect a decision from the Public Service Commission on or before December 8. I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial update. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Tom. For the third quarter of 2015, we earned $1.05 per share, compared to $0.80 per share in the third quarter of 2014, an increase of $0.25 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we earned $2.30 per share, compared to $1.88 per share for the same period in 2014, an increase of $0.42 per share. Earnings for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 include after-tax charges of $93 million or $0.11 per share; and $112 million or $0.13 per share, respectively, related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project. Earnings for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2014 include after-tax charges of $258 million or $0.29 per share, and $493 million or $0.55 per share, respectively, related to the Kemper County project. Earnings for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, also include after-tax charges of $12 million related to the proposed acquisition of AGL Resources. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, also include a $4 million after-tax charge related to the discontinued operations of Mirant and the March 2009 settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC. Excluding these items, earnings for the third quarter of 2015 were $1.17 per share, compared with 1.09 per share for the third quarter of 2014, an increase of $0.08 per share. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, excluding these items, were $2.45 per share, compared with $2.43 per share for the same period in 2014, an increase of $0.02 per share. Earnings for the third quarter of 2015 were driven by positive retail revenue effects in our traditional operating companies, partially offset by increased operations and maintenance expenses. Quarter-over-quarter, earnings were also positively impacted by Southern Power's recent project development and acquisition success. A more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers can be found in the slide deck posted on our website. The southeastern economy continues to grow, supported by robust employment growth, a steady recovery in the housing sector, stronger than expected consumer spending and continued in-migration into our region. As a result, we experienced positive growth in retail sales in the third quarter, as total weather-adjusted retail sales increased 0.2% over the third quarter of 2014 and 0.6% on a year-to-date basis. Weather-adjusted residential sales were up 0.1% over the third quarter of 2014 and 0.5% year-to-date. This growth has been driven primarily by customer growth, which is approaching historical norms for the first time since the recession. For the first nine months of 2015, nearly 28,000 residential customers were added across the Southern Company's system, with 38,000 added in the last 12 months. Weather-adjusted commercial sales were up 1% during the third quarter of 2015, compared with the same period in 2014. Growth in commercial sales has been consistent across all three quarters this year and reflects improved in-migration, growth in the residential customer base, modest income improvement, and increased consumer confidence and spending. Consistent with this data, the Atlanta office market absorbed almost 2.2 million square feet in 2015, driving the vacancy rate below 17%; the lowest level since the end of 2008. While industrial sales are up 0.5% year-to-date, they fell 0.6% during the third quarter. A strong dollar, low oil prices and weak global growth condition continue to constrain growth in the industrial sector. Exports remain on a downward trend, although our region continues to fare better than the rest of the nation. While the performance of industrial segments such as chemicals, primary metals and paper has lagged, those results had been at least partially offset by improved performance in the Transportation segment and in construction-related segments such as lumber and stone, clay and glass. Our economic development pipeline remains robust and on a positive long-term trajectory. In September, Mercedes-Benz announced that it will be producing a new hybrid SUV at its Vance, Alabama plant. This $1.3 billion project will result in the expansion of its SUV assembly shop and the creation of 300 new jobs in 2017. Tuscaloosa-based SMP Group and Birmingham-based Magma International, both suppliers to Mercedes-Benz, plan to add 600 jobs and 350 jobs respectively. You will recall that Mercedes-Benz is moving its headquarters to Atlanta. It's recently been announced that Lincoln Financial Group will also relocate to Atlanta, adding 600 jobs in 2016. In addition, Norcross, Georgia-based Suniva, a manufacturer of solar panels, has also announced it will add 500 jobs in the immediate near-term. To-date, more than 12,000 new jobs have been announced in our service region this year. This represents an increase of more than 250%, compared to the first nine months of 2014. The projected investment for new projects announced year-to-date is $4.8 billion, a 95% increase over the same period in 2014. Before I share our earnings outlook for the remainder of 2015, I'd like to provide an update on Southern Power capital expenditures resulting from the recent successes that Tom noted earlier. In February of this year, we provided a forecast for Southern Power capital investments totaling $1.4 billion, with $600 million of that set aside for placeholder projects. Southern Power's success in finding value-accretive projects has exceeded our expectations. Strong relationships, tax appetite and a proven ability to close transactions has made Southern Power an attractive partner for acquisitions in the renewable market. As a result, Southern Power is now projected to have capital investments totaling $2.3 billion for 2015. Similarly, for 2016, Southern Power has already secured project investments consistent with our earlier forecast of $1.3 billion, with even more projects still under consideration for that year. We are optimistic that Southern Power will exceed its current forecast for 2016 much as it has surpassed its 2015 forecast. Since 2010, when Southern Power made its first investment in utility scale solar with the Cimarron Solar Facility, Southern Power has developed one of the nation's largest contracted renewable portfolios with more than 1600 megawatts of generating capacity announced, acquired or under construction. Key attributes of this portfolio include : long-term contracts averaging more than 20 years in length; high credit-worthy counter parties; and a long-term low volatility cash profile that is an excellent complement to the rest of Southern Power's generation portfolio, as well as to Southern Company's overall financial objectives. Turning now to our fourth quarter estimate or earnings per share guidance for 2015. Our fourth quarter estimate is $0.43 per share. This implies a year-end result of $2.88 per share, excluding charges associated with Kemper, AGL and Mirant-related items, which is at the very top of our annual guidance range of $2.76 to $2.88 per share. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Art. As evidenced by our discussion today, the third quarter of 2015 was indeed a remarkable quarter. However, I would be remiss not to mention that the most significant measure of our performance is always customer satisfaction. With that in mind, I am pleased to report that our four traditional franchise utilities have once again ranked in the top quartile for customer satisfaction for the 14th consecutive year in our annual Customer Value Benchmark survey. Among three national peer utilities, I mean, Alabama Power, Gulf Power and Georgia Power are the only utilities to rank in the top quartile for all three customer classes : residential, general business and large business. As always, it is our customer-focused business model with its emphasis on outstanding reliability, best-in-class customer service and rates below the national average that remain the cornerstone of our business and a key driver of long-term value to Southern Company's shareholders. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, we'll now take the first question. Operator : One moment, please, for the first question. And our first question today comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Anthony, how are you? Hey, man. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Never been better. How about yourself? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Doing great. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Just two quick questions, the first on Southern Power. I mean, what is that company seeing in the market right now for price of like utility scale solar? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, Anthony, this is Art. It depends on the PPA contract and how old it might be. More recent contracts are priced a lot lower than the older ones; and that's a function of kind of the timeframe of when that original PPA was established. So I have a hard time giving you an answer about \u2013 that wouldn't be very meaningful to you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The general trend is newer contracts are cheaper than older contracts. Prices are coming down. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And moving to Kemper, I mean, you guys seem like you're making some great headway at Kemper in start-up. But earlier this month, the Mississippi staff had filed a recommendation or I guess their view of the project and they're looking at something, I guess, a start-up date much different than what the company is forecasting. Are there any big differences or things you think maybe the staff has missed and why you're more optimistic on the first half 2016 start-up, where I think the Mississippi staff engineer put it somewhere like a 30% likelihood of a 2016 start-up? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Anthony, it really goes to kind of people's assessment after the technology risk. This is a first-of-a-kind technology. And if I had to kind of segment the four big tests we've been going through, the first one I think was a test of, I'm going to call it, the structural integrity when we pressurize the whole facility. The second test really went to first fire of the boiler. The third test is this fluidization test. The fourth test will be essentially turning lignite into syngas. And when I think about that, the most important of these tests I think from a technical standpoint was this fluidization test. Recall that scale-up from Wilsonville to Plant Ratcliffe at Kemper County is about 100-to-1; and I think different people saw our ability to do that differently. In fact, I know there were some people that were very dubious of our ability to achieve that kind of performance with scale-up. Just as serendipity would have it, I was at the plant walking the plant site and in the control room on the day that we passed the first test. It started at midnight and went through \u2013 and actually it's still going through right now. But I can tell you once we hit the fluidization process, it was amazingly stable. Even in, say, the first eight hours of the test it was amazingly stable. Obviously, there's always little fine-tunings; and that's one of the things that they're working on through the balance of the fluidization test for Unit A. But I would just say that outsiders looking at this technical process would have put a lot more risk associated with that. The fact that \u2013 look, I should say this, we expect it to be successful; we didn't expect it to be as good as it went. So we're very happy with it. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Thank you, bud. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Dan. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Tom, just \u2013 hey. Just on the renegotiation on Vogtle, you guys have long said that your contract was a fixed-fee contract, lot of protection, and it seems like your renegotiated that contract in exchange for money. Can you like tell me or lay out for me what pieces got better in the contract from what you had before to justify the extra money going to the EPC guys? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, Dan, if you think about what gave rise to the commercial disputes and the litigation, the original agreement resulted in disputes that arose from field interpretations of a broad range of NRC regulatory requirements. In other words, the contract said, you've got to do it if the NRC regulator requires you to do it; they would dispute a field interpretation of a requirement, Dan. The revision in the language, which is much tighter, says that going forward only new regulations or guidance documents, so these are actual pieces of paper, that are officially issued and acknowledged by the NRC as changes to the agency's previous positions will be considered owner's responsibility, is a very much narrower definition as to what's eligible for a change order. That's a really big deal. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And I guess that Toshiba certainly had other problems in the press, but how did you guys get comfortable with concentrating your performance needs on them? And did they make any financial guarantees to put collateral or credit aside to cover if they end up running overruns that are on their tab versus your tab? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Oh my gosh! I think we're in so much of a better shape. Dan, you could phrase the question that way or you could phrase the question about CBI and the all the concerns there. Basically, we put Westinghouse right in the front seat. And you may recall from the issues you raised about Toshiba, Westinghouse has taken its accounting charges, I think, around 2013, somewhere around that timeframe. And they were not subject to their business, Westinghouse's business was not subject to a lot of the concerns that Toshiba entered into in its accounting problems. So Westinghouse itself did the hard work earlier in time. They are not impacted directly. And we think that going forward the balance of risk is much improved for the project, for Westinghouse to take the prime contractor role and not have to deal with kind of a codependent control with CBI. We're much better off. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And I'm sorry for belaboring this. I just want to make sure that I understand the pieces. But you guys and scan (30:50) are now targeting the same in-service dates or guaranteed in-service dates for your units. Is there enough trade labor to be executing kind of the same finishing work at the same time? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. We have all the labor we need on-site; and let's be very clear that labor now transfers from CBI to Westinghouse largely, for the most part. And we believe while whatever you say about kind of on the schedule dates, we think we're about two months kind of ahead on a schedule basis, at least than they are. We believe we've got plenty of personnel. You may have also seen that Westinghouse has entered into some conversations with Fluor about augmenting personnel at the sites. So we feel great about where we are there. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very good. Thank you, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Steve. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Tom, hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, just kind of a technical question on your financing slides in here. So you have, I think, $2.12 billion of equity over the next three years in here, and the last time you did this slide after the AGL deal, there was none. Is that just that you're now including the equity to fund the AGL deal in the plan and that's the only difference? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. That's correct. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's what I thought. Secondly, on Southern Power, maybe just overall, what kind of returns are you earning on these projects that you've won over the last year or what kind of expected returns? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Every project's a little different. We've kind of been over this in calls in the past. We use the same methodology that we used in the past. In other words, we use a hurdle rate that looks like a yield curve. And the shape of the yield curve or the requirement, where you are on the yield curve is based on a variety of factors, including the term of the contract, any of the project specific risks, things like that. In general, what we have kind of said is that the ROE, the book ROE of Southern Power, is expected to exceed kind of our regulated book ROE by some amount. And, again, it depends. The longer term contracts will resemble a utility return. If, in fact, there are greater risks in a utility project, then we can see 150 basis points higher. That would be the general range that I would be looking for. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And that's good for not just the whole, so that's good for the new investments that you've been making (33:37). Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely right. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And how generally are you levering these projects? 50-50? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Southern Power's about 45% equity, 55% debt; and that's the way we've financed that organization for years now. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We think that corporate financing is much more effective, more flexible, cheaper than project financing. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And may I just... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Excuse me, Steve, one more thing, just to be clear. When we look at these things, they're all on an IRR and cash basis. You asked the book return, but same thing. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, yeah. Yeah, no, so it's low teens, low to mid-teens IRRs \u2013 or, excuse me, levered IRRs? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. For an unlevered IRR, it would be 6% to 7%, depending on what \u2013 it would be just identical. Just like I said, either identical to or slightly higher than what we would be out of the core utility business. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just so I understand, based on this kind of new what's locked up for Southern Power on the update that you've given. Roughly what level of ITCs do you expect to have in 2015 and 2016, or at least in 2015? Could you give us that number? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'll get somebody to... Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hold on a second. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We're getting the number now. But we're assuming in everything we're looking at that the 30% ITC goes away in 2017. So it's just 2015 and 2016 left. Frankly, our relationship that we've developed with the people like First Solar and others, our ability to execute quickly, our tax appetite have all given us, I think, this kind of flow of deal our way. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Steve, the number is \u2013 I can't find the number. The number I recall is about $55 million this year; and that probably compares to $45 million to $48 million last year; somewhere in that range. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We'll get it for you later. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, lastly, it looks like based on the fourth quarter projection you're going to end up the year at about the higher end of your range for 2015? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. (36:12). Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. So if you were to say what's driving you kind of being at the higher end, is it primarily the higher Southern Power investment or something else? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's operating companies performing as we thought they would, plus what we know is going to happen with Southern Power. If you look at our past three, four quarters, it's about $0.43 a share; somewhere around there. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. If you look, our fourth quarter earnings have run across the board. It depends on what kind of weather year we've had. But as I look for the year-end, Steve, I'm looking year-over-year; I expect maybe $0.05 of the accretion year-over-year to come from Southern Power, maybe $0.06 from the operating companies, a penny from our parent and maybe minus $0.04 on shares. And that would account for the $0.08 increase from $2.80 to $2.88. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Maybe if you just look at our past three years' performance of earnings per share, in 2012 through 2014 we went $0.44, $0.48, $0.38. We feel very confident about our ability to hit our numbers. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, man. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Michael. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. How are you doing? Quick question on Kemper is, are you seeing the first half of 2016 for commercial and service, how about the deadlines for tax credits and I think it's April, is that right? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's right. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Are you thinking \u2013 I guess does the successful test give you any confidence about trying to meet that deadline? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, by taking the contingency for the next three months, we're suggesting that the probable outcome is not to make that, but we'll only... Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There's an opportunity that we could... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And there's still opportunity to hit that date. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And in terms of the $350 million, how does that compare to the press numbers that we had earlier seen about the lawsuit. I mean is it $900 million, I believe I recall, plus extra growth on top of that for other items? And does the $350 million represent basically \u2013 is that a resolution of the entire $900 million-plus? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's actually bigger than $900 million-plus. If you think about it, our share, if you kind of gross up our share in disclosures, the current litigation was around $1.5 billion, something like that. Now that's total. And then what we also \u2013 that was for the first kind of 21 months of delays. Recall also we're wiping away potential extension of current litigation for the next 18 months that would carry us through to in-service dates in the middle of 2019 and 2020. And we also tightened up, recall, Westinghouse taking over for CBI; plus we tightened up in a very significant way the ability for the contractor to provide change orders that would be agreed upon. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So when you add all those up, we think the settlement is very attractive. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Does this mean that the contractors are picking up the other part of the 1-point-something-billion above the $350 million in their lawsuits? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : If that's the real number. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, if that's the real number. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We always disputed that. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann from Mizuho Sec. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : JvR. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Tom Fanning. How are you? How are those yellow jackets doing? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey. After last weekend, they're doing great. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Exactly. Couple of questions. The first one I guess is \u2013 the first several questions are on Kemper. When do you get to run the lignite through for the syngas test? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right around the end of the year; could be early January, but \u2013 yeah. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I've got to tell you, like I said, I was walking around the plant, I was in the control room, met with plant management later that day. The general belief is we're going to be able to manipulate lignite a lot easier than sand. Sand is a denser material. They all felt that if we could pass this test the way we were doing, they really felt they're going to be able to handle the lignite pretty well. So they're feeling good. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then the second question on the whole Kemper thing is do you need to see the whole plant operational before you can file the second rate case in Mississippi? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think that's the intention. I mean, the whole plant, it needs to be CoD. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: That's what I meant, yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then just switching over to the settlement. I know there's a lot of \u2013 congratulations on getting that done \u2013 but I'm just having a tough time still understanding how those risks are bucketed now that it's done. So let's just say you get to 2020-2019 and everything else and you're going to start seeing some delays. How does all that work? And who bears what risk, I guess, is the question I'm really asking, longer term? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So let me operate in kind of the world of 100% dollars, as opposed to Georgia Power dollars. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But we've guided installment payments on this last $114 million such that fuel load now becomes the kind of operative target in the contract. In 100% dollars, $35 million is tied to fuel load on year-end 2018 and $35 million is tied to fuel load on December of 2019. And to the extent they miss, I think it's about $10 million a month \u2013 something like that \u2013 that, that number would be reduced. So not only is this third $114 million staged to milestones over time, it also is heavily weighted as an incentive to hit fuel load when we said it would. Now here's my other editorial comment. You remember when the consortium changed their schedule. There was a lot going on behind the scenes and you heard kind of the probable angst in our voice about that these problems are being driven not really by the performance of the project, but by arguments and disputes among the training contractors. It was our belief that they gave us a schedule that they can improve on. We believe, given what everybody has agreed to here, that they're going to be able to hit this schedule. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. But in the unlikely event, what you're saying is, let's say this thing slips into 2021 or something for the first unit, who absorbs the PTC in the absence of the PTCs? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, there would be $10 million reductions in the incentive payments, there would be liquidated damages. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay, okay. I got it. I just wanted to make sure I was reading it correctly. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Super. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, buddy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ali. How are you? Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, Tom. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Super. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Couple of things. One is, Tom, if I look at your weather normalized retail sales, we saw the slowdown in the third quarter and you were at 0.6% through the nine months. So how does that 1.3% for the year target look now and what's realistically the target we should be looking at for the year and looking beyond that? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's less. You know what, Ali, I mean not to kind of wear the Fed thing out, but we're seeing the same things the Fed is seeing, especially when you look at kind of the leading and the lagging nature of these indicators. Industrial sales are a leading indicator; commercial sales are typically your lagging indicator. Well, it looks as if the leading indicator is slowing and the lagging indicator is what's really carrying the day. So that's kind of interesting. I think the Fed is wrestling \u2013 and Art went through a litany of kind of the data. I think the Fed is wrestling with those same things. If they now begin liftoff and communicate a trajectory, what does that say about the confidence of the continued recovery, given all the exogenous factors like malaise in Europe, event risk, Russia, Middle East, lack of transparency in China. These are the things we're all wrestling with. The good news, as Art said, is kind of Atlanta, for example. Top five in the United States in job creation and in in-migration. In fact, we were fourth in job creation, I think, only to Houston, Dallas and Phoenix. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Correct. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So that's all good stuff. If you look at our economic development pipeline, 15,600 jobs announced \u2013 12,000. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: 12,000. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : 12,600 jobs announced in the year 2015 and that will take place from 2015 through 2018; almost $5 billion in capital. The economic development arm looks pretty good. And so we kind of say to ourselves, what is this? Is this a permanent flattening? Is this a secular change in the growth of the United States economy, or is this a pausing in which, now, as we adjust to a different export environment and monetary environment, we'll catch up? What would you add to that? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Ali, I think if you look at the numbers, industrial is really the one that's lagging the most. And, as you remember, from a revenue perspective, that is the least impactful to our company. But if you had them at 1% growth rather than a 0.5% growth, we'd be up close to a 1% growth year-over-year on a year-to-date basis, almost actually 1.3%. But we're really pleased with the commercial end of the business. We've been waiting for a number of years for that to come around, and it has. Customer growth has been very strong. That's, again, a reflection of in-migration. Use per customer is still eating away that. That's a bit of the efficiency gain that we're seeing through natural occurrence with appliance replacement and those kinds of things. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Not only energy efficiency, but also this kind of \u2013 we think here again, a secular shift away from single-family housing to multi-family housing. And that's really driven by just kind of new tougher credit guidelines, as well as it may be with the millennials, they like being flexible and living in apartments, rather than undertaking big fixed investments like owning a house. So we want to see how that shakes out, too. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So at this point, embedded in your full-year numbers, Tom, what would be sort of the weather normalized load growth we should be looking at? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Weather-normalized number for retail sales, about 0.7%. I mean, that's just a pure guess. But seeing what we're seeing in the industrial market and we expect the commercial market to do well, that's about what we think. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And you've talked about, I think, 1.2%, 1.3%, sort of longer term as well and in growth. Is that still what you feel is the right number? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We're going to relook that and we'll update you on that on the next quarter's call when we look at the full-year 2016 through 2019. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Separate question. Tom, coming back to Southern Power for a sec. So given that you've obviously exceeded your targets and you've got a bigger portfolio, what's sort of the underlying annual net income run rate that this portfolio is now running for you? Obviously, higher than you were previously thinking. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, man. So it was fascinating when you kind of break down where we were into 2015. We knew just because they have contracts in place, they were kind of below $150 million in net income; and then we gave them kind of a stretch target to hit that would get them up to about $180 million. So when we thought about developing the financial plan, we kind of had a number in there of about $180 million. And with everything we know now, we're going to be over $200 million, more likely $210 million. And so, we'll see. So we've done better. My sense is we're going to see similar performance, even though we haven't set all these numbers yet. I'm just telling you what I think. I think we're going to see similar performance next year. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, in the past, you talked about the headwind that would be created by the ITC going from 30% to 10%. How should we now think about that as we're thinking about 2017? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Well, this is kind of fun to think about. Because we've been very public, and I hope you guys give us credit for this. We're very transparent on how we see growth rates and everything else. And when we tell you what we believe about growth, it's because we can see it with reasonable kind of stretch targets, we think we can do what we say we're going to do. When we reduced our growth rate to 3% to 4%, it was because of all of these factors; and we were very transparent in telling you about \u2013 I think the funny word I used was divot in 2017. That would be represented by the loss of 30% investment tax credit and, likely, fewer projects for solar in that and maybe wind helps fill that in. And then we said that we would resume a growth rate that would be more attractive once we saw more environmental spending at the end of the decade and into the 2020's, as well as the response to the clean power plant. And then we did the AGL merger. So let's think about the slugs of kind of EPS growth. 2015 and 2016, you're seeing Southern Power outperform our internal targets; and so you're seeing growth there. From 2017, 2018, 2019, because AGL has very predictable and transparent earning streams resulting from safety-related pipeline replacement programs that are under rate riders. We already know Georgia, Illinois, potentially other states. We can see, and I think we suggested that you would see something like $0.10 a share or so in the 2017, 2018, 2019 timeframe, okay? So we bump up there on top of whatever Southern Power can produce. And then some of those projects continue into the 2020's. And then you see in the 2020s now, I think now you have time to get to the ramifications of environmental spending, plus new generation required by the clean power plant. So not only will that be more renewable, it will be more combined cycle, probably displacing coal, as well as more combustion turbines needed to respond to the intermittency of greater penetrating renewable resources. So if you look at it, the first slug is going to be Southern Power, the second slug will be Southern Power plus AGL, the third slug will be Southern Power, AGL, plus clean power plant and environmental spending. And so, I think we'll give you more guidance about our growth rate in January. Suffice to say, we did say that our new kind of longer term trajectory, assuming we close AGL, will be in the 4% to 5% range. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. It's very helpful. Last question on AGL financing, have you gotten the credit rating agencies completely on board with your financing plan or is that still being worked on? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we had discussions with the agencies prior to the announcement. And we outlined the financing plan for them issuing equity over a three-year timeframe, and that we believe that our metrics will be consistent with where we are before where we are today by the time we get to 2019. We'll issue a lot of debt upfront, but over time we'll get our metrics back to a point where they're consistent with where we started. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Whatever. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Well, just to follow up on, I was a little unclear about Mike Weinstein's question about the Kemper tax credit. You guys do expect to get the plant up by April to get it, is that what you were \u2013 it wasn't completely clear. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We think that we might or might not. We've added three months of reserve contingency to be conservative to say that we might not make March 31; it might be as late as June 30. So that's the financial charge we made. Obviously, we've got to hit the date in April in order to get the ITC. If we don't and it has a cash impact, its book impact is about $3 million a year, somewhere like that. And we could supplant it with other available tax credits that we're seeking to get from the IRS due to the nature of the plant. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then with respect to the \u2013 when do you expect the gasifier, I guess? I've got an idea of where you expect the lignite testing, but after the lignite testing, which I guess is the end of this year, when do you think that it'll be as a milestone in terms of when it will actually be commercially able to produce synthetic gas, I guess? Or, I mean, when will we know that? I mean what's in between the lignite testing and the actual sort of commercial operation of the gasifier? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, so what will be going there, you're going to get really good indication on reliable syngas to turbines, okay? So that's a big deal. The other things that you're going to get will just need to be tested along that timeframe, will be acid gas removal. So let's think about this for a minute. Recall that we're going to take the syngas, we're going to take out 65% of the CO2 and we are going to also take out sulfuric acid and also ammonia. All of those by-products have value and that goes into the total value premise to the Mississippi's customers. And recall also that while we'll do first syngas to turbine around the end of the year sometime, in order to get CoD; we want to have both trains operational, both trains checked out. I will \u2013 just a new piece of \u2013 not a new, I guess (55:51) also, but we tested out the flushing of the systems of the acid gas removal systems, and actually we provided for three complete tests of that and we did it in two. And I want to say that the benefit of doing it in two was a three-week benefit. It was something like that. That also went exceedingly well. Look, I know we're taking a long time and I know we're taking some pain for taking the right amount of time, but what you're getting out of Kemper and you've seen it already is that what we have built and tested is working beautifully. The combined cycle is working as good as any combined cycle in the United States. And these major systems of the gasifier are working well. So I know we've all, me particularly, have had to have patience here, but I think we're taking the right approach. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, great. I mean, just to sort of \u2013 last quarter I asked you about sort of the MMBtu sort of operational cost of the gasification process, and I think you guys were sort of around the, generally speaking, around 250 in MMBtu. Do you guys feel better about that number or is that pretty much where you guys still feel now that you've gotten three months more and accomplished so much more with the testing and everything? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And let's review the bidding there. You remember it correctly. What we were tying that to that was an estimate based on, I think, $50 oil, because that's how we price the CO2. It's basically on index. And we have to take or pay contracts in that regard. I've kind of wiped away the variability around ammonia and sulfuric acid. So that's kind of correct. The other thing that's really interesting that we're building the capability to do, we've alluded to it in the comments this afternoon, but is a quick switching capability between syngas and natural gas. That should help our reliability characteristics in meeting plant performance criteria. So we're going to be able to deliver to Mississippi's customers, attractive economic natural gas, electricity, whatever the fuel markets deliver to us. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, great. And then just finally on AGL, you guys went over the checklist and what have you, but obviously you've had discussions, I assume, with parties and stuff and others. Any sort of color you want to give on terms of that and how things seem there? I mean, anything pop up or not or...? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, you bet. Listen, we've met with regulators both in Illinois, New Jersey, other places. Recall, we have a real ace in the hole here, and that is our Chief Counsel's Jim Carr. Jim Carr used to be a commissioner on a North Carolina commission. He was also President of NARUC. And I can tell you with personal observation, when you walk in a room with Jim Carr to the New Jersey Commission or the Illinois Commission and he knows the people and they know him and he already has trust and, if you will, brand equity. It is a tremendous kind of benefit to have. The other thing that I don't want to underestimate, when we entered into the merger with AGL, they run a heck of a business in the jurisdictions in which they serve. I can tell you, personally, talking to the Chairman of the Illinois Commission and all the other commissioners there, it was very clear that AGL, when they bought Nicor, made several promises about how they would operate that business, and they have followed through, and even more so, on every promise they've made. So they have great credibility. Given kind of our reputation, our customer satisfaction criteria, our embracing of an integrated, regulated business, our customer focused business model, when you look at our data, number one in the United States, we are getting very constructive responses to everything that we've done so far. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Michael. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Tom. You're right that Georgia Tech ending reminded me of an Alabama-Auburn, one I'd rather forget. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. It was way better than that one. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got a question for you. What is your outlook, what is Southern's outlook for the potential for renewable development within the utility service territories in Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi? Which ones do you think have the opportunity to have incremental renewables? Where do you think that could happen in rate base versus PPA with third parties? And which are the ones that may be a little bit further behind in the process, but have the potential to play catch-up down the road? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's a fascinating question. Every one of our companies, right now, has a solar program in place. And you want to know something that's even more interesting? I've been a critic of renewable portfolio standards. All of our companies have entered into these agreements without the hammer of a renewable portfolio requirement. You may know also that we've had a longstanding, outstanding relationship with the DoD. And it occurred to us that the DoD, nationally, and this is why we've tried to strike this relationship, that they have had kind of a renewables requirement on their own and a severability requirement on their own, and we have worked to play offense with these folks to provide them real solutions not only to meet these requirements, but to give them more sustainable operation from a base standpoint going forward. So all of that has worked exceptionally well. It is clear to me that as the clean power plan goes forward, you're going to see a lot more solar, particularly in our state. You might see wind, but you know I've been just a little bit of a critic of wind for the southeast only because the best wind resources are way far away from us. The three deals we've done on wind for the host utilities really are located in Kansas and Oklahoma. The right long-term electricity design for America is not to rely on long haul transmission networks to move electricity. You're always better off from a physical design standpoint to locate the generation near the load resource. So solar's going to make more of a penetration than wind in the southeast. We might be able to do some wind in the southeast; we'll see. The other things that we had some problems about in the past we've done in Texas, but we haven't done in the southeast, is biomass. If we could ever get back in that business, I think the southeast is a good place to go. And if you want to think about other kind of resources that are going to be particularly important to meeting clean power plan, nuclear and hydro. We never count hydro as part of renewable resources, we probably should. And when I think about kind of if you add up all the wind, all the solar, biomass and hydro, we're approaching something like 7000 megawatts owned or controlled by our company. That's where it's going to go. And along with that, there will be combined cycle gas as base load supplanting coal, CTs to handle the intermittency, and more gas infrastructure, which we've been talking about for some time, that we'll be able to move the shale gas from where it is to where it needs to be. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett from Morningstar. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mark. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick \u2013 you've provided a little bit of information on how you see the economic landscape unfolding right now. And I know it's not something you typically provide, but on the commercial and industrial load trends that you're seeing, is there any way you could give us a little more granularity on maybe Alabama versus Georgia and how those two large territories are either diverging or kind of moving together? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, on the industrial side, Alabama is probably gotten more of their kilowatt hour sales in industrial than Georgia, but actually Georgia's industrial sales are a little bit bigger. But their other markets are bigger, too. But Alabama is predominantly steel, chemical, and a little less paper than Georgia's got. But those two have done less well here in the, I guess we call it, industrial recession. Georgia has some steel, not as much as Alabama. They've got more paper. And that has suffered a little more. Some of that paper is down because of low gas prices and they're co-generating more of their needs because of that. So that's a bit of what we're suffering there as long as and as well as I guess lower pulp prices for paper as well. So if you talk about the commercial markets, it's more fulsome in Georgia, I would believe. They've got a bigger commercial market especially within the metropolitan area of Atlanta. And so that's where you're seeing the much more robust growth. You're seeing a little bit in Alabama, but not as much as in Georgia. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And much more in-migration in Georgia than elsewhere in the system. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The other thing that is a big deal, but we're sworn not to talk about, so let me talk about it, is kind of IT jobs and service \u2013 I mean, server farms and all that stuff. Those people are very sensitive about those infrastructure plays. Don't want to talk about where they're located or who they are, but we're seeing some growth there. That's because of our reliability on price position. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Yes. Well, thanks for the color on that. And just a quick update with the Georgia filing for the merger, do you have kind of a rough timeframe for that? Any update on that or...? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Probably next month. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Next month. Okay, I'll definitely keep an eye out for it. Thanks. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon again. So just one quick question. The $1.5 billion of equity that you plan to do in 2016 for AGL, are you going to wait until the merger closes to do that or might you look to do some kind of like forward transaction or something like that? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We're still considering those options, Steve. But the base plan is we expect to raise the equity in the manner that we've raised it in the past, and some of the internal programs \u2013 we've already turned our internal programs on, beginning in October of this year. So we'll issue in that fashion through 2019, is currently planned, but we're also considering other elements of that that could possibly be used. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Like in the past, we've done things like discrete issuances, we've done dribble programs, we've done a variety of other things. That's what Art was hinting at. But whatever we do, we don't want to impact the market. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. Okay. Thank you. That was it. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi from Avon Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Andy. How are you? Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : I'm doing well. Thank you very much. Look forward to seeing you soon. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, absolutely. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : I am glad you moved on from CBI. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, no kidding. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : I think that's very positive. Just a question on Southern Power. So can you qualify how much net income and cash comes from solar in 2015? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : $51 million. That about right? Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : In cash? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Net income \u2013 I don't know about cash. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We've got to get that detail for you after the call. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Okay. That's fine. And then I guess, without giving out a forecast, but you said about \u2013 I'm sorry, are you going to say something, Art? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We were looking at each other and that $51 million was the year-over-year increase. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Okay. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So we'll get on.... Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Okay. How much did you get last year? Do you know? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : From what? Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : That would solve that. Net income from solar. If the $51 million is a year-over-year increase. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We'd have to add some numbers. It'd be easier for us to get with you offline on that. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think what we said earlier was $51 million on ITC. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Okay. And, again, I guess in 2016, the $210 million, does that have growth in solar or is it kind of \u2013 and again, I know you didn't give a forecast. Right. But then, Tom, I think said that without giving out a forecast that 2016 Southern Power would be pretty close to 2015. Didn't he say that? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So what I said was when I think about the kind of projects we see, what we've circled so far, 2015 we're guessing we're going to have a cap allocation of around $2.3 billion. And we already kind of circled up about $1.3 billion in 2016, which is kind of in our base plan. So we've already circled up our base plan, and then we think we should expect to see kind of similar performance for the balance. So it wouldn't surprise me at all to see a $2.3 billion number in 2016. But don't know it yet, just what I've said. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Okay. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Andy, to be clear, the $210 million was a 2015 estimate. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Okay. And how much did you invest this year in solar? Capital? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, Andy, we're going to have to follow-up. We don't have it split. We've got some capital in there for wind and solar, so I just don't have the split. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The majority of it's solar. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Okay. Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We'll get it to you. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Okay. But I guess it's not fair to kind of look at it just on the net income basis as far as return of capital, but obviously return of cash is in some ways more important, right? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's enormous, yeah. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Yeah. So that's why I wanted to get the cash number. Okay. I'll wait till Jimmy Mann (1:12:00) calls me back. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The mayor? Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : The mayor. Good mayor. That's the mayor I like. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Me too. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : And, Dan Tucker, congratulations. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. How about that? Daniel S. Tucker - Senior Vice President of Finance, Treasurer: Thanks, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital : Yeah. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, look, we've been talking for some time and you all have been so wonderful to be patient with us. I think we're reaching that inflection point in the story. We've always traded on a risk-adjusted basis. The returns are terrific. We're one of just one or two companies like us that \u2013 we can't promise you anything in the future. My lawyers always look at me here. But for the last 10 years or 11 years, we hit our numbers, we hit generally really well within our numbers, even despite duress. And I think the risk side has been tainted somewhat with some overhangs from the Vogtle litigation and the Kemper project. I think resolving the litigation is an enormous inflection point. I think the technical test that we've just gone through, while not removing it completely, have really reduced, I think, significantly the technical risk in Kemper. So I think we're really moving the company in the right way, and I think the days ahead are very bright. We thank you so much for being with us this afternoon, and looking forward to seeing you in a couple weeks. Operator, that's all. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company's third quarter 2015 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dimitria, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 3, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Aaron Abramovitz : Thank you, Dimitria. Welcome to Southern Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss on today\u2019s call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas Fanning : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. 2015 was a tremendous year for Southern company as we continue to see outstanding performance in our franchise operations. We saw a strong financial performance from both our wholesale subsidiary Southern Power and our traditional operating companies. Our state regulated utility delivered these 2015 results despite the warmest December in the last 120 years. We continued our longstanding tradition of operational excellence. Once again ranking among the best in our industry for customer satisfaction and solidifying our reputation as one of the most trusted energy providers in America. We experienced great success with strategic initiatives as both Southern Power and our traditional operating companies continue to build the energy portfolio of the future with significant expansions of their renewable energy resources. And then our ongoing quest to deliver superior risk-adjusted long-term growth. We entered into an agreement to acquire AGL Resources and create a platform from which we expect to compete for growth more broadly across the energy value chain. Now regarding AGL Resources, I will just briefly add that activities related to the proposed merger are progressing in a timely fashion. The waiting period under the HSR Antitrust Improvement Act expired in late 2015 unnecessary milestone for closing the transaction. In addition AGL Resources shareholders voted in November to approve the merger. The merger remained subject to certain other customary closing conditions, including state regulatory approvals, and we are currently engaged in regulatory proceedings for the various state commissions. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016. In a few moments Art will discuss the drivers of our financial performance in more detail and provide guidance for 2016. Before that however, I will address the progress we\u2019ve experienced with our major construction projects at Plant Vogtle and in Kemper County Mississippi. First, an update on the Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4. As reported in our last quarterly call, we agreed to a settlement with our contractors for the two new units at Plant Vogtle. We have now finalized that settlement and the related litigated has been dismissed. As a reminder this $350 million settlement resolved all outstanding commercial issues for the project and amends our EPC agreement to provide even greater protections for customers. The settlement affirms and provides incentives for anticipated fuel load dates in December 2018 and 2019 as well as our expected in service dates in June 2019 and 2020. In a related transaction Westinghouse acquired the nuclear construction arm of Chicago Bridge & Iron. This move positions Westinghouse and its affiliates as the primary contractor under our EPC agreement and they have engaged with floor to provide day-to-day construction leadership. We\u2019ve worked very closely with the contractors through this transition and I am pleased to say that thus far we are very encouraged by the improved communication and efficiencies we\u2019ve observed on site. On January 21st, Georgia Power filed an application for review of the settlement with the Georgia PSC. Yesterday, the PSC made and approved a motion, asking Georgia Power to file further information within the next 60 days pertaining to the prudent of the project to-date as well as the current schedule and cost forecast. Other interested parties will have an opportunity to make filings of their own in response. This will allow the PSC to consider the settlement agreement in the contact of a more comprehensive review of the full project cost and schedule. The commission staff which will not make any separate filings will have six months to analyze these filings. If the staff identifies any issues of imprudence or unreasonableness they are directed to work with Georgia Power toward a possible settlement of any such issues within that same six months period. During this six months period there will be no hearing. If there is a settlement between the company and the staff, Georgia Power and the commission staff will file that for the commission to consider in the fall. If the parties do not come to a settlement the commission will decide how to proceed. Let\u2019s turn now to an update on the Kemper County Facility. The combined cycle performed exceptionally well in 2015, providing over one third of the electricity consumed by Mississippi Power customers last year. Major startup activities are ongoing and we continue to transition to operational testing. Fluidization trials on the first of two gasifiers are complete and we were able to begin the cure out process for the gasifier refractory. The fluidization process was an important validation of the scale up of the technology as the operators were able to use the control system. We circulate sand and air at design flow rate through the gasifiers a good rehearsal for the eventual introduction of lignite to the operation. The team is currently working to repair a portion of the refractory on the first gasifiers and making improvements to all of the nozzles in the refractory lining of both gasifiers to address hotspots identified during the initial cure-out process for the first gasifier. The type of work to repair and improve the refractory lining is similar to the refractory replacement there will be a common part of the plant long-term maintenance. However these activities are time intensive and they are the primary driver for our schedule extension into the third quarter of 2016. As always quality and safety are our top priorities as we are taking steps to help ensure that Mississippi Power\u2019s customers will enjoy the benefits of our reliable source of low cost energy for decades to come. We expect to introduce lignite to gasifier in the spring this critical step is the beginning of the important process of integrating all of the various systems of the facility. In December the Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved rates for the combined cycle assets already in service. Mississippi Power plants to seek recovery of the remaining assets after they are placed into service. Art will now provide a financial update including an outlook for 2016 and beyond. Arthur Beattie : Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning we had solid results for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.30 per share, compared to $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year of 2015 we earned $2.60 per share, compared to $2.19 per share in 2014, an increase of $0.41 per share. Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were $0.44, $2.89 per share respectively, compared with $0.38 and $2.80 per share respectively for the same periods in 2014. As Tom mentioned earlier our adjusted annual result of $2.89 was just above the top of our 2015 guidance range we established a year ago. The major earnings drivers when compared to our $2.80 adjusted result for 2014 where residential and commercial sales growth, retail revenue effects and tremendous success with renewable projects at Southern Power. These positive drivers were partially offset by increased shares, higher depreciation, operation and maintenance costs and weather. A more comprehensive list of drivers is included in the materials we released this morning. Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2015. The economy within our region continues to experience modest growth, favorable domestic market fundamentals include strong employment growth that have served to underpin consumer confidence in spending. At the same time the effects of the strong dollar, low commodity prices and economic weakness abroad have combined to constrain manufacturing growth in our region. Total weather-adjusted retail sales grew by 0.3% in 2015 led by commercial sales, which were up almost 1% for the year. We experienced positive growth for the commercial sales in every quarter in 2015, which we have not seen since before the recession. Weather-adjusted residential sales grew by 0.4% during 2015, growth in the residential sector has been fueled largely by customer growth as the Southeast continues to see positive in migration. More than 37,000 new residential customers were added in 2015, an increase from 2014 when we added some 31,500 new customers. Industrial sales fell by 0.3% in 2015. We experienced a modest deceleration in industrial growth in our region as a result of the strong dollar, low oil price and natural gas prices and significant economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets. We have seen the impact of these factors on three of our largest industrial segments, primary metals, chemicals and paper. However transportation and housing related industries have supported growth and we expect those segments to continue to Growth and we expect those segments to do well in 2016. Economic development activity remains robust and consistent with previous quarter\u2019s activities. Job creation and capital investment for 2015 exceeded 2014 levels and the pipeline of potential projects grew significantly compared to recent years. Corporate announcements and potential projects represent a broad cross section of industries including automotive, primary and fabricated metals, aerospace and chemical segments. Also within our region Alabama was named the top state of economic development by Business Facilities Magazine and Georgia has been ranked first for business climate by Site Selection Magazine for the third consecutive year despite economic headwinds from overseas, our regional economy remains in a positive growth mode. During our most recent economic roundtable consensus of the participants was that the economy will grow in 2016 supported by robust employment and spending growth, modest income gains and a steady housing recovery all pointing to further growth in energy demand. Our sales growth guidance for 2016 is 1.1% for retail sales, 1.2% for residential sales and 1% for both commercial and industrial sales. Before we cover the detail of our capital expenditure forecast, financing plan and earnings per share guidance, I would like to speak to the impact of the recent extension of tax benefits on our financial outlook. We currently project that a five year extension of bonus depreciation will improve cash flows by approximately $ billion through 2020 and potentially more assuming Southern Power is able to execute on its growth plan. This translates to a significant uplift in the value of the enterprise. Over the next few years some of the biggest tax benefits are expected to be generated by plant Ratcliffe, plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 along with a variety of renewable energy projects and environmental compliance investments. Considering our customer focused business model, this is very good news. All else being equal, our customers should benefit from lower retail rates over time. In addition to the implied reduction in regulatory risk, we expect to enjoy reduced exposure to both debt and equity capital markets over the next several years. Perhaps the greatest benefit of all these tax benefits is the level of cash flow support we project for our common dividend. Of course dividend policy is ultimately subject to the approval of our Board of Directors, but our expected cash coverage of dividends is greatly improved compared to how we characterize our dividend growth at the time of the AGL Resources merger announcement. We fundamentally believe that value is a function is risk and return. Given the magnitude of the dollars and the high degree of certainty inherent in these deductions, Southern Company\u2019s value proposition should be greatly improved. We provided an updated forecast of capital expenditures for 2016 through 2018 in our slide presentation. This standalone projection does not include AGL Resources. Anticipating continued success at Southern Power, we are excited about the possibilities that exist with the extension of tax benefits for both wind and solar projects. We have enjoyed a higher than anticipated growth from Southern Power in recent years, in fact a year ago our 2015 through 2017 CapEx forecast was approximately $3 billion. Today, based on our recent success, we estimate the same period to be about $5 billion of investment for Southern Power. Going forward, we expect to sustain that same level of activity and success, in fact our Southern Power forecast for 2016 through 2018 includes CapEx of $5 billion for wind, solar and traditional natural gas generation project. Our CapEx forecast for our traditional operating companies does not include projects specific to the clean power plant. If our ultimate compliance plants require investment prior to 2019 our current CapEx projection could or would increase. Our forecasted $1.8 billion investment in environmental compliance over the next three years is largely associated with EPAs, effluent guidelines and final coal combustion residuals rule. Included in the appendix of our slide deck are our projected financing plan, credit ratings and a schedule of maturities and a liquidity summary. Within our financing plan, you will note the anticipated debt issuances to fund the AGL Resources merger. We expect these notes to be issued shortly before the closing of the acquisition and to include a blend of maturities. Additionally, we are planning on a $1.2 billion in equity issuances in the calendar year 2016. As discussed earlier the extension of bonus depreciation is expected to reduce our exposure to the capital markets and that has resulted in a favorable impact to the remainder of our financing plan. Considering the incremental cash flow along with our Department of Energy Loan facility for Plant Vogtle construction and an assumption that we will utilize securitized financing for a significant portion of Kemper, which is subject to approval by the Mississippi Public Service Commission our exposure to the debt markets for our traditional operating companies over the next three years should be limited. Southern Power\u2019s debt financing needs will be driven largely by their success in finding suitable projects to fill the placeholders in the CapEx forecast. An additional benefit of the incremental cash flow from bonus depreciation is the effect on our need to issue new equity. We currently project no additional equity issuances beyond the $1.2 billion in 2016. Financial integrity and strong credit ratings have always been priorities for us and that emphasis remains unchanged. Our financial outlook including our expected credit metrics in 2016 through 2018 has improved and we continue to believe our credit profile is fully supportive of our credit ratings. Moving now to our earnings per share outlook, you will recall that we began issuing new shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 under our internal equity programs largely to fund the AGL transaction and to reinforce our commitment to financial integrity. The cumulative effect of the shares issued in 2015 and projected for 2016 equates to a $0.06 diluted impact on our standalone 2016 earnings per share. In addition the estimated impact of bonus depreciation is $0.04. But for the cumulative impact of these shares and bonus depreciation we would have been in the top half of our 3% to 4% standalone trajectory for 2016. Considering these drivers, our standalone 2016 earnings per share guidance excluding any cost to achieve the AGL Resources merger is $2.76 to $2.88 per share. Assuming the AGL merger closes later this year, our long-term earnings per share growth outlook remains a range of 4% to 5%. In addition our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2016 is $0.53 per share. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas Fanning : Thanks, Art. As evidenced by our discussion today, 2015 was indeed a remarkable year for Southern Company, and we enter 2016 with strong momentum. The franchise business is performing at a high level solidifying its industry leadership. We see great progress on major capital projects with the completion of the Kemper County facility on a near-term horizon and Plant Vogtle unit 3 and 4 over 60% complete. We anticipate the addition of AGL Resources later this year and we see a stable economy in a region poised for continued growth. Our cash flow and credit profiles are significantly improved and we continue to project 4% to 5% long-term growth in our business. With the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and communities we are privileged to serve. We believe Southern company is well position to succeed in the month and years ahead. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, we\u2019ll now take the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Hey, Dan. How are you? Daniel Eggers : Doing good. Thank you. First question for you just on the load growth outlook, kind of your 2015 maybe a little more tougher than hoped and you looked at the kind of the rally in 2016. Can you just maybe share a little bit more what you\u2019re seeing particularly on the residential side are you seeing some usage gains or what do you see kind of sprucing that up, and then kind of on the industrial front doesn't seem like the world's getting a whole lot better that the idea that that\u2019s going to bounce this year also? Thomas Fanning : So residential we are seeing a continued in migration of customers. That\u2019s the big deal and we think that our projection of 1% is going to be driven largely by that. Interestingly through the work I see in the Fed we see similarly here in terms of consumption. Consumption is kind of flattish and you are seeing that also in the federal reserve data as well. That\u2019s not all bad. There is this long-term dividend by cheap oil, therefore cheap gasoline prices, cheap natural gas prices all is accruing to increase essentially the disposal income of households throughout the Southeast. Interestingly they are attending to increase their savings rate rather than their consumption rate at that point. Not all bad because that typically serves as an insulator against future economic shocks. So that would be kind of my first comment. Arthur Beattie : Yeah, Dan, you asked about industrial, we commented about three largest segments primary metals and chemicals and paper were down last year. We expect them to kind of be flattish this year. There are still elements of strength in the primary metals group. I think if you look at automotive steel there is still a good demand for that, architectural steel is actually going pretty well to boot. And then in the automotive sector, automotive is or transportation is expected to expand. We\u2019ve got expansions going on, it\u2019s some of the customers in our jurisdiction Mercedes being one of those. There is model expansions as well. So we expect those numbers to actually do well next year and then the housing related industries primarily in Georgia are expected to continue to grow, which is kind of a reflection of the continued growth on the residential and commercial end. Thomas Fanning : And I commented earlier this morning on squat box about this throughout 2015 as I appeared in that forum culminating in a December meeting I had with Dennis Lockhart there on set. It was interesting, our leading indicators started showing softening, our lagging indicators commercial were really good and I have been kind of bearish particularly in the December telecast. Our guys do a bottom up forecast and we\u2019ve done as business round table discussion here in the Southeast with all the economist of the major entities here and based on a bonds up analysis plus we are seeing from the round table here in the Southeast we do expect these major industrial participants to start adjusting to this new reality and improve their performance into the end of the year. Dan Eggers : Okay, got it. And I guess the bonus appreciation cash is pretty huge amount of money, coming back to you guys was there any way for some of that cash to offset the equity raise you guys needed at AGL and... Thomas Fanning : Yeah. Dan Eggers : Is that... so is there a way to mitigate down the numbers you guys gave when you announced the deal so maybe the equity ratio is going to be less the $1.1 billion or whatever the number was originally. Thomas Fanning : Let me take you through dump math and then we\u2019ll talk about how we attributed it here. Dump math the number is going to be somewhere between $4 million and maybe over $5 billion. The $4 billion of cash that we talked about is really through 2020 and doesn\u2019t really assume that Southern Power execute its growth plan, which we think they will. So the number could be higher maybe over a longer time frame. When we look at - so that\u2019s kind of a source of cash, when we look at the uses of cash over time we got into an argument here internally about how to attribute the benefits of that cash. So let\u2019s go through it and let\u2019s just use the $4 billion number although the number could be higher. We had always assumed in our former financial plan assumingly we buy by AGL a $3 billion equity issuance over the time frame. We are going to do $4 billion in cash if you just use a 40% equity ratio, 40% times $4 billion so it\u2019s the cash retires a mix of capital requirement the equity portion that would be 1.6. If the total amount of equity was 3 and you don\u2019t have to issue 1.6 now that leaves you 1.4 to issue. When you look at the usage of cash, we could go through a variety of ways to attribute these shares, but since the biggest issue of cash is a near-term use and that is to acquire AGL. So we decided to allocate the new equity essentially to that project. And so if you think about it $200 million issued in 2015 plus another $1.2 billion represents the balance of $3 billion less $1.6 billion equals $1.4 million. So that\u2019s really the simple math. Look Dan we could have allocated the equity to Southern Power, we could have taken pro-rata approach, this is just the way we decided to do it, to keep the plans in place through 2016. Dan Eggers : Okay. And I guess one last question just that cash reduction in the rate based growth because of bonus depreciation, there was enough room in the 4% to 5% earnings growth band that reduced rate base deployment is not going to work you guys down in the growth rate you provided in the hall? Thomas Fanning : Well, there is a give and take there, right? Essentially the take is yeah, sure reduces growth but the other side is, there is the benefit of excess cash and therefore less shares as I just outlined with you, $1.6 billion less equity raise over the same time frame and remember part of this appropriation still was not just bonus depreciation it was ITC and PTC. So you will see a sustained Southern Power growth plan through this period and we think we are within that range, we\u2019re able to maintain it. Dan Eggers : Okay, got it. Thank you guys. Thomas Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Thomas Fanning : Hello, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yeah hi, hey Tom and Art how are you? Thomas Fanning : Good. Steve Fleishman : Just wanted to kind of clarify something here so, when you announced the AGL deal, I think you said it was 4% to 5% growth off of your standalone 2015 base, is that correct? Thomas Fanning : That\u2019s right. Steve Fleishman : And the midpoint of that was 282. Now you\u2019re saying 4% to 5% growth off of your 2016 guidance, which is also still a midpoint of 282. So, if I go out and look at the future like I looked out to 2018, if you just take the 4% to 5% to find that way, what was going to be 322/18 would essentially be 308? So could you just be specific on what is the $0.14 difference between what you had said before and what you are saying now? Thomas Fanning : It\u2019s simply the shares associated with the preliminary issuance to support AGL plus the estimated impact of bonus depreciation. Look, PE times EPS is a shorthand for value when you think about the intrinsic value of Southern we got bumped from the passage of this bill an additional $4 billion to $5 billion and perhaps more of cash. So, when you look at the delta, the number is $0.04 here that\u2019s how you get to 282 and we grow off of that 4% to 5%. It is inescapable in fact I would argue that the adjustment from a book standpoint is in earnings per share, but the value adjustment is probably in the PE ratio, if you do a dcf on Southern we just increased $4 billion to $5 billion just on cash from where we were before. So take 288 at 5%, 276 at 4% and that will be our growth trajectory going forward. Steve Fleishman : Okay, and then - Thomas Fanning : Hey, Steve one more thing, real quick. Recall also, we talked about of course this is all subject to the board approval, all of our credit metrics are improved now, we got a lot more cash, so all of our credit metrics are better. And when you look at the dividend thing if you want to do a Gordon model approach evaluation we\u2019re better off than we were. In other words we said, given the earnings profiles and the growth rates and everything else according to the Board approval we\u2019ll pay an additional $0.07 in 2016 and then we would grow that to $0.08 okay. We\u2019re on the same trajectory, assuming the Board approves and our cash flow metrics covering that dividend are somewhere between 20% better to historical performance around 10% better than what we thought it was when we announced the AGL deal. In other words, our ability to pay the dividend because of this cash is enhanced relative to where we are consistent with the value proposition. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Should I read that as this just supports better the higher dividend growth that you talked about in the deal or are you suggesting that there might be a chance to grow it even faster than you said? Thomas Fanning : Let\u2019s say at a minimum it supports the growth that we said before. We\u2019ll always evaluate it year-to-year based on the Board. But my point to you is we are significantly better from a cash flow coverage or dividend standpoint than we were before this point. And so we\u2019re able according to board approves, we\u2019re able to maintain what we said before and we\u2019re even better are from a credit standpoint. And that include it\u2019s going from $0.07 to $0.08 in the increase. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So I get that just okay. One other question just on the Georgia review, do you view this I mean the commentary about the commissioner seem to be constructive. So do you view this an opportunity to kind a go back to kind of getting a bit of a pre-prudence decision because I know that was initially the law than it kind you settle that away and so there is an opportunity to do that or is just do you think this is kind of a risk or how should we interpret this review? Thomas Fanning : Steve we think this is bullish. This is all associated with the settlement of the litigation and recall if you dial the numbers back around BCMA we decided not to pursue these courses because we were in front of litigation and we didn\u2019t want to do all of that. So the commission sell - and we\u2019ve seen a lot of public discourse about this that the settlement was good for everybody. The commission is taking the lead in evaluating now is this the right time to pursue prudence. So we\u2019re following their lead, we\u2019ll prepared these exhibits in the next 60 days and we\u2019ll pursue this process as outlined by the commission. But overall, we think this is very constructive. Steve Fleishman : Okay. I\u2019m sorry I just want to go back one more time, so the difference in the future earnings that we discussed that is really all do longer term to the bonus depreciation not having as much rate base because of that obviously that\u2019s offset by financing, but net-net that is the reason for the difference. Thomas Fanning : That\u2019s right and we\u2019re going to maintain the - you go through your Gordon model stuff. We\u2019re going to maintain the trajectory of the dividend so payout ratio is up. The cash flow coverage to dividend is significantly higher. And as our growth rate goes from 4% to 5% payout ratio comes down pretty quickly in the years ahead. So what we\u2019re doing is maintaining with better credit posture what we said before. Steve Fleishman : Okay thank you. Thomas Fanning : Yes sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Anthony Crowdell : Good afternoon, guys. Thomas Fanning : Hey, how are you? Anthony Crowdell : Never been better. How about yourself? Thomas Fanning : Awesome. Anthony Crowdell : Just two real soft ball questions I guess. One is on Kemper, you had some like I don\u2019t know you called it hotspot so you had a, I guess two other refractory. I mean is there a period where you get to when you\u2019re comfortable with now the gasifier and I don\u2019t say out of the woods but maybe the high cost or whatever trying to get this online is passed you. Thomas Fanning : Yeah and let me very clear. What we\u2019re doing with the refractory is not high-tech. it really involved finding some hotspots looking at that making and not only fixing what was there but making an improvement to both gasifiers. So we\u2019re taking the opportunity to once we get this thing up and running it will run in a safe reliable manner for years to come. So we took the opportunity to make improvements. These are not high-tech nor they reasonably expensive. However they are time intensive. Taking these steps right now, we think will benefit us long-term unfortunately they do add about two months to schedule. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. So the startup process otherwise as we were so excited I guess the last time we spoke the fluidization test and the more technical test have gone beautifully. So we\u2019re very kind of energized by the steady rate of progress in start-up. Didn\u2019t like the delay but we think that will service right in the long run. Anthony Crowdell : And just lastly if I move to Southern Power it seems like I don\u2019t want to say perfect storm, but you have the, maybe yield closer to other companies that were investing in a lot of their projects at Southern Power was also investing in, I mean is there a lot more potential you guys have a lot of cash, great cost of capital that Southern Power really just takes tremendous advantage of this downturn in the market and sees a lot more projects open to them? Thomas Fanning : We\u2019re very excited about the opportunity for Southern Power in the next few years. We\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to execute like champions, we\u2019ve developed terrific relationships with the people in the field and I think the first comment I want to make is recall this $2 billion outperformance in capital deployment from 2015 through 2017 we think it\u2019s the same from 2016 into 2018. Now I think I feel very confident we\u2019re going to be able to execute there, there are some wild cards out there it will be fun to see when gas starts reemerging, okay. And so that could even accelerate beyond what we\u2019re showing right now, but right now I think we\u2019ve got a good plan. We continue to execute in a very discipline way and we\u2019ll see where it goes. I have very kind of positive views about our ability to execute for Southern Power in the years ahead. And one other things we just moved Buzz Miller over there he is a very talented guy and I think we\u2019ll do great. Anthony Crowdell : Great thanks for taking my question guys. Thomas Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Hello, Paul. Paul Ridzon : Tom, how are you? Thomas Fanning : Awesome, how are you? Paul Ridzon : Well thank you. Just want to make sure I understand you\u2019ve got in your guidance the shares to fund the acquisition, but no revenues from the acquisition? Thomas Fanning : That\u2019s way basically they are excluded from kind of ongoing EPS, exactly right. Paul Ridzon : So when you assume the deal closes, or you just assume it doesn\u2019t close this year? Thomas Fanning : Well now remember the earnings profile of AGL is such that its frontend loaded. The other earnings are in the first half of the year. They don\u2019t really earn very much in the second half of the year. And so what I\u2019ve been telling everybody is you shouldn\u2019t expect any contribution in 2016 out of AGL. And on a standalone basis, as we suggested in the script if you remove these kind of one-off items, we were in the high end of the 3% to 4% range. Now when you bring AGL on beginning in 2017 and beyond we change our growth rate to 4% to 5%. We feel very comfortable about that. Anthony Crowdell : And that includes AGL. Thomas Fanning : Yes, and that includes everything. Anthony Crowdell : 2016 doesn\u2019t include anything for AGL. Thomas Fanning : So remember AGL plus fewer shares plus the growth rate of Southern Power gets us back to the 4% to 5% that we told you we would do before. And we think even with the higher payout ratio as the book EPS would suggest the cash flow coverages allow us to pay that with even greater safety. We\u2019re in a better position on the dividend than we were before when we announced AGL. Paul Ridzon : So bonus. Thomas Fanning : Yeah. Paul Ridzon : And then just back to your comments on Southern Power should we look for you to kind of what\u2019s the right scale in your tax appetite to do more renewables? Thomas Fanning : So I\u2019ll let Art kind of fill in on that we find ourselves because of this excess cash and tax benefits in a carry forward position. We\u2019ve adjusted we are adjusting our IRR requirements, we only have this very disciplined process we go through, particularly for the solar deals and I\u2019ll let Art go through that unchanged probably is our wind deal. Anthony Crowdell : I think you just wrapped it up it\u2019s just you said Paul we\u2019re going to not be able to monetize some of the investment tax credits quite as quickly as we had expected for solar however it\u2019s a little bit different for wind because production tax credits are spread over a 10 year period. So we\u2019ll still look at incremental solar, we\u2019ll look at incremental wind and we\u2019ll still apply very disciplined processes Tom talked about to our approach to every project. Thomas Fanning : And we talked to you before in October about we had a great backlog already in 2016 winning all those projects fit underneath our curves even as they are adjusted. Paul Ridzon : And then Tom I kind of heard in the background this morning on TV. But you didn\u2019t my undivided attention had a couple of things going on. Thomas Fanning : Come on Paul. Paul Ridzon : And I\u2019ve been looking forward to a replay on it. Can you just kind of you view your comments you had about kind of a new age because of e-commerce or electronic? Thomas Fanning : Yeah. It\u2019s fascinating stuff. We really do have a great team of economist here and we are just seeing this now in a broader sense. Here is the issue, we had talked historically about leading and lagging indicators and in fact I would argue our stuff is as good as anybody in predicting the direction of the market and what we had been seeing historically is that industrial sales are the leading indicator, even better than that is economic development. But let\u2019s just stay with industrial sales. They create jobs, they grow personal incomes that are above normal for the Southeast, as we create jobs people move in, they get those jobs, they get the higher income, they start consuming more that\u2019s residential. And then as more people move in, the commercial sector comes in, they do dry cleaners and grocery stores and hospitals and schools. Now there is an emerging segment in the commercial class. So the commercial class is the lagging indicator and it matured really well during 2015 and so you say is that a bearish signal. There is an emerging important segment in commercial sales that really relate to the electrification of the economy. As the whole economy becomes more digital in its composition we are seeing especially in the Southeast the advent of data farms - server farms, of IT professional and these jobs are two to three times higher than typically what would you see in a normal commercial job like a restaurant or a school. These are really high paying job and they don\u2019t have the kind of correlation to industrial activity that you see typically from commercial to industrial. And just as a supporting statistic Georgia was just named the seventh fastest growing state in the United States for technology employment. This is a sustainable growth rate and doesn\u2019t have that correlation. So even if industrial starts to take off and all that again these guys are going to sustain and we are very excited about that, the buying power, the economic quality of this segment is really good. Paul Ridzon : And then your 1% forecast for industrial sales growth that\u2019s just based on economic development activity you expect to start taking move? Thomas Fanning : Yeah. Plus I think even the people that had been damaged a bit by the downturn and the malaise in international economies and cheap oil and the strong dollar and all that, even there we are seeing these people adjust to this new market reality. Let me give you a fun statistic there, nationally we are seeing United States exporting down around 7%, in the Southeast it was down only 2% and that really picked up at the end of the year. The Savanna Port had a record year in terms of its activity. So I think what we are seeing is some of these industries that had been hurt pretty bad and maybe they are coming off a low base chemicals, primary metals et cetera now adjusting to this new reality. Paul Ridzon : Thank you very much. Thomas Fanning : Yes sir, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Hey, Greg. Greg Gordon : I don't think that it's possible to patent the dividend discount model; I think that was already done by someone else. But thanks. So a little bit more on the question of the visibility on the solar and wind stuff. I understand you said you are going to - because you theoretically you are going to be able to monetize ITCs now over longer time frame, your IRI are higher, every other utility holding company is in the same boat. So your marginal competitor for an incremental solar project is just Conad [ph] or Dominion or Duke then you are all on the same boat and that doesn\u2019t really change the competitive landscape. But if your marginal competitor is someone who is at a similar credit rating and is still has tax appetite. Doesn\u2019t that put you at a theoretical disadvantage going forward in order to achieve your targets? Thomas Fanning : Yeah sure. As you positive at your question now, but and what we\u2019ve already seeing for the projects that we\u2019ve already circled for 2016 and I remember in October I gave you great confidence about our ability to execute 2016 in a similar manner. I think we\u2019re going to be able to do that. We already know that those projects meet our hurdle rates even with the adjustments. And don\u2019t forget about the importance of relationships, our ability to close, the fact that we\u2019ve worked in joined development if you will for people to get power cells agreement better suitable to our risk return profiles. And so I think all of this will work to our benefit. We don\u2019t see really any significant slowdown. I just wanted to let you know that we were looking at the time value of the cash, but it doesn\u2019t make a substantial difference to be honest with you. I feel very bullish about our ability to execute the growth program. Greg Gordon : Okay, great. And I know that Steve asked this question in a million different ways and I come up with a slightly less lower number in 2018 but semantics. But is it solely the impact of bonus deprecation all things equal or are we also sort of seeing the compounding effect of slightly lower than expected sales growth in terms of earned returns on across the business as well. Thomas Fanning : It\u2019s all bonus. Greg Gordon : It's all bonus. Thomas Fanning : Yeah lowers your growth rate. Improving your growth rate is going to be less shares improving your growth rate is going to be the growth plan at Southern Power and we\u2019re going to keep rolling. Hey remember, we talked about $4 billion I mean, I know we\u2019re conservative on all these things, but Southern Power execute these growth program it\u2019s going to be more than $4 billion it could be in fact a little higher than $5 billion. Greg Gordon : Got it. Last question Georgia, things look like they\u2019re going in a positive direction in terms of them reviewing the settlement them doing prudence. You also have a rate plan that you\u2019ll either again the counting order for again this year or go through a normal rate case process as you usually do when you roll these things. Is that work load sort of theoretically like achievable by the Georgia commission this is the lot of stuff for them to get done this year or should we expect some of the stuff to sort of roll into 2017 just by the sure magnitude of what they\u2019re trying to accomplish with three major approvals pending here the settlement, the prudence review and the rate case. Thomas Fanning : Yeah man I mean add to that. I think we\u2019re doing integrated resource plan, we have DCM 14 filed on February to be done and whatever it is July and August. And then we have 15 in the middle of the year. So if you think about it we've got a lot of activity. And I know when they had suggesting to go through this process the staff rates and issues about work load. Look we all get that we have a history since really 1995 of working very constructively with the staff and the commission. And we\u2019ll find a way to balance the work load and achieve good results for everybody. So it\u2019s a great point let\u2019s let the commission to figure that out and we\u2019ll work with them to get good results. Greg Gordon : Okay, thank you guys. Bye-bye. Thomas Fanning : Yes sir, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, it\u2019s Julien here? Thomas Fanning : Hey Julien. Michael Weinstein : Yeah there you go. Just for the record I just want to say we\u2019re both on the call. I will let Julien do the talking. Thomas Fanning : You do all the work he does the talking, right? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Well a quick question if you will. Just to elaborate on the last series of questions around the growth rate. Can you be specific around the ITC benefits recognized in 2016, 2017 and 2018 as well sort of, what do we see in this year and what are you thinking going forward. Dominion's laid it out the other day they\u2019re seeing obviously with the lower CapEx a rolling off. So what are we expecting - what are we baking in there is there an offset to the bonus depreciation potentially with more solar ITCs. Arthur Beattie : Well the problem is the bonus depreciation pushes out, stands in front of the monetization of the ITCs. So the more solar you do the more bonus you book kind of pushes out the equation of it. But if you look at 2016 and 2017 look we\u2019ll be back into utilizing tax credits I believe sometime in 2018. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. And how much I\u2019m just kind of curious, how much is baked into the 2018 number and then just be very clear about it or are you\u2026 Thomas Fanning : So if I had to read I mean, I am looking at some [indiscernible], I mean it looks like yeah you\u2019re in there you\u2019re kind of done in 2017 you\u2019re into consuming it in 2018 and you\u2019re done by 2020, 2021 it gathers itself up pretty quickly it consumes it pretty quickly. We can give you breakdown year-by-year I guess later but\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And is there any incentive to delaying projects just to kind of think about it allowed if you\u2019re not getting the tax benefits now why not push them off if you can renegotiate the deals get a little bit better, little better uplift? Thomas Fanning : You\u2019re talking about solar deals? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah there is talk out there in the industry I suppose you guys could potentially be a leading indicator on it? Thomas Fanning : No you know what I mean, it\u2019s an interesting question, here is something that we have talked about, but so far we haven\u2019t seen much of it. Remember when we thought there was going to be a cliff from 2016 to 2017 and we all said boy there\u2019s a freight train running to get deals done in 2016 and we kind of said well you know what if we get this expansion which we did with all the activity show up in 2016 or would it start to spill over into 2017. We\u2019re seeing some of that okay, but we still feel that for the projects that were circled by us back in 2015 for 2016 that they\u2019re still going to happen pretty much in 2016. There could be a minor spillage if you will into 2017 but here\u2019s what I think you\u2019re going to find more likely and that is more projects now come to light. When you think about people starting to anticipate proactive responses to the clean power plant, other states\u2019 activities with respect to renewable portfolio standards, look I think there is a tremendous appetite to grow both solar and wind in the years ahead. So my sense is with the added ITC and PTC extensions the market is going to well exceed, I\u2019m just going to guess what we all think is out there. And the price for those projects will reflect the fact that the general participants in the United States are going to have bonus depreciation sitting on top of them. In other words I think this will all resolve itself and we will see additional growth that would be my guess. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Can I just go back real quickly clarify regarding some questions here, when we\u2019re talking about the ITCs I was specifically inquiring around the earnings impact not necessarily the cash. Is there any solar ITC earnings impact reflected in the 2016 guidance in 2017 or are you also delaying this earnings recognition? Arthur Beattie : No for both purposes you will still recognize the benefit of ITC. The recognition for cash that will be delayed until you got room to take them. Thomas Fanning : So the cash benefit gets delayed a bit and you\u2019re in the kind of I don\u2019t know if I did an average to that it\u2019s kind of an average I don\u2019t know 2.5 with a four year total kind of thing. That\u2019s kind of the time value magnitude you\u2019re talking about. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But just to be clear how much like EPS are we talking about in 2016 guidance? Arthur Beattie : In total for Southern Power? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah or for the ITC just I\u2019m thinking about like that being something of quasi one-time that you want to think about\u2026 Arthur Beattie : I am going to say it\u2019s about $150 million. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Of ITC benefit in 2016? Arthur Beattie : Yeah right. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right, great. And 2017 and 2018 I suppose it\u2019s proportionally lower based on the CapEx you\u2019re projecting that probably a fair statement. Arthur Beattie : It depends on the mix, remember the mix of wind and solar. So we\u2019ve just given you a number, we\u2019ve not defined it anyway between what\u2019s solar, what\u2019s wind and what\u2019s gas. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, all right great thank you. Thomas Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Hey, Stephen how are you? Stephen Byrd : Great how are you doing? Thomas Fanning : Awesome. Stephen Byrd : Awesome. Most of my questions have been addressed, so just wanted to touch on new nuclear and checking on the Sanmen project in China what\u2019s your sense in terms of the progress at Sanmen? Thomas Fanning : That\u2019s good there were the - I guess there are big hold ups related to the reactor cooling pump, resolved those technical issues, those have been resolved. I think they\u2019re moving forward. I forget which ones is which, but one's going to go in service this year and I think Sanmen this year and early next year will be Hian [ph], they are going well. With respect to new nuclear certainly as the clean power plant starts to mature and states responses. We\u2019ve said it before there is really a big three maybe a big four in responding to that. I think new nuclear makes a lot of sense big scale, base load, no carbon emissions. Clearly renewables will be a big player will be for us have been for us. And then when you see kind of intermittent resources like wind and solar come to play, you\u2019re going to need two types of gas come in. One piece of gas which will be the ability for generation to follow the intermittency will be CTs. So we think you\u2019ll start to see CTs in a big way. And then it looks tough for coal certainly new coal. So if you want to look at base load looking gas that looks like CCs. So those are going to be the trends that I think you\u2019ll see going forward. Right now Georgia has filed its integrated resource plan, but that really is not particular responsive to the clean power plant it is way too far early to get a kind of cogent response by the state. So you should view the IRP in Georgia as being pre-cleaned power plant in its composition. Stephen Byrd : Understood. So that could add as you think about the clean power plant that can add addition opportunities but probably a bit later on just given that the time frame of that regulation. Thomas Fanning : Yeah and that's right, but you\u2019re going to get this conundrum of whenever you decide whenever its accepted by EPA and everything else if gas is going to be a big deal and if you got four years to start building combined cycles and you got to have a response in place by 2022 for example. You got to start right away. And that\u2019s why I guess Art made the comment that you\u2019re going to start seeing potential changes in the CapEx budgets. If CC starts to show up in the backend of this three year budget we\u2019ve lead out for you. Stephen Byrd : Yeah, okay thank you. Just had one last question just on Toshiba and Westinghouse. We\u2019re very pleased obviously with the settlement and improvement of the risk position. There is a little bit of press reports about the position of Toshiba and potentially looking at their investment in Westinghouse, but that looks more like a financial test rather than anything operational. I assume it\u2019s the case that the people that you want in terms of the team involve from Westinghouse et cetera. There if Toshiba were to take a right off of Westinghouse that\u2019s not necessarily really it translates into anything different in terms of team composition or commitments to the business or anything of that sort. Arthur Beattie : No not at all Steve. Thomas Fanning : In fact we would argue look, we\u2019re in such a better spot than we were. Thing about the relative positions of the partners we have a single point of contact now they\u2019re not having to fight with each other. In fact we\u2019re already seeing improvements on the site we\u2019re going to 24 hour coverage which we didn\u2019t have before. We\u2019re seeing an acceleration in the subcontractors for things like panels, new port news, organ iron works. A much more focused workforce on site. Now this thing has been terrific. And with respect to any and I\u2019ll let Art to comment on this. But with respect to any credit issues at Toshiba with respect to their ability to undertake their financial obligations under the contract. They provided us LCs to meet their obligation. Arthur Beattie : When they were downgraded below investment grade. In terms of the contract required them to commit letters of credit, which we received about a month ago. Thomas Fanning : And they\u2019re written by strong banks we\u2019re completely happy with. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Thomas Fanning : You bet, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourezza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead Thomas Fanning : Hey, Shar. Shar Pourezza : Hey, Art and Tom how are you? Thomas Fanning : Super. Shar Pourezza : So just looking at slide 10, the dip in CapEx that you\u2019re showing for Southern Power I am still trying to just figure out is this the pull forward of demand under the old tax regime or is that sort of Southern Power shifting out their CapEx profile given the higher hurdle rates or the less tax appetite? Arthur Beattie : Are you talking in 2017 Shar? Shar Pourezza : Yeah right in 2017 exactly. Arthur Beattie : Yeah I think it\u2019s a bit of the lack of supply at this point is that\u2019s going to have to adjust to the new market reality that you now have extended the ITCs beyond down to 2021 that you don\u2019t have as many projects that were in the mill so to speak. Thomas Fanning : Yeah and you know what I mean that I think Art is right on the money there, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that the market for that number grow and I feel good about our ability to execute within that growing market. Look at what we\u2019ve done and that\u2019s why we want to make a point in the script about kind of the last three year forecast we gave you was $3 billion and we did $5 billion for heaven sake. Right now we are saying it\u2019s going to be $5 billion for the next three year and we are going to do $2.4 billion in 2016. So I would say as while there is only $2.6 billion in the last three years. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that number growth. When you see the availability of these tax credits and you think about people getting ready for the clean power plant, the market is going to grow. That\u2019s what we are showing right now, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to stick within our plan. But I think there is room to grow. Arthur Beattie : If you look at the RPS standards expansions that will certainly drive some of the growth naturally anywhere. Thomas Fanning : Absolutely. Shar Pourezza : And then just sticking with the growth, large scale acquisitions on the renewable side I have to imagine there is willing sellers and maybe you could just touch on if you can, the recent media reports that Southern Power was potentially looking at Sun Edison\u2019s portfolio? Thomas Fanning : I haven\u2019t seen that and I\u2019m not going to comment on it. We are active, we have terrific relationship, have had terrific relationships with major developer. First Solar has been one, Recurrence another and so we work lock step with those guys and that\u2019s why we are so confident about kind of our forward supply. Certainly there are projects that are in existence and if we are a logical buyer we will participate really hard. I\u2019ll give you examples where we\u2019ve done that. In Georgia after the solicitation process that went through a lot of developers when we did deals there we became a very attractive participant because we could execute with a great deal of financial resources and just work it really well, that\u2019s going to be an existence. But with respect to any particular name we would never comment on that. There is going to be stuff available though. Shar Pourezza : Got it. Thanks so much. Thomas Fanning : You bet, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Ali, how are you? Ali Agha : Good, Tom, good afternoon. Thomas Fanning : Good afternoon. Ali Agha : Just to clarify a couple of points you had made earlier just to make sure I\u2019m getting them right. So first off on bonus depreciation, is it fair to assume that the $0.04 hit if you assume 2016 is that a good annual number to think about for 2017, 2018 as well? Arthur Beattie : No, it will go up as we move out in time, Ali. The facts are that we were actually a cash tax payer in 2015 and we did before the extension of bonus we\u2019ll probably have been more in 2016. So it\u2019s the smaller effect in 2016, but it will be grow over the time. Thomas Fanning : But just remember consistent with the guidance we\u2019ve given you we are going to overcome and a continuing burden by less shares, growth plan, addition of AGL. Arthur Beattie : Right. Ali Agha : Yeah, I get that. And then secondly so given this ITC and PTC extension and Tom you alluded to the fact that previously you were looking at a bit of a cliff in 2017. So off that 2015 earnings base for Southern power, how should we be looking at the next three years? Relatively flat or growing given that these have extended how should we think about that change now from your perspective? Thomas Fanning : These guys hate me talking about this, but [indiscernible] we have continued to beat Southern Power\u2019s goals every year. When I think about, I want to go back to 2014 we estimated around 150 or so and we got 170 or so. When we estimated 2015 we estimated 180 and we are going to get to 215. Now here is what\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m going to give you a number in 2016, it\u2019s going to knock your socks off I think. But remember we added to the CapEx so our CapEx went from, I forget what we estimated 1-2 to 2-4 round numbers in 2015 and then we said we are going to execute similarly in 2016. So imagine the CapEx that we\u2019ve been expanding on projects and while we jumped up to 215 the effect of this acceleration of CapEx at the end of 2015, we were spending CapEx. We didn\u2019t have projects and service. Once we go into services in 2016 you\u2019re going to see a great big jump and that jump could be as high as high $200 million to $300 million in net income. So, it\u2019s going to be a big bump. Now, consistent with the CapEx that we\u2019re showing you here, that number is not sustained and in fact the less CapEx and the idea of the cliff and all that would show that our net income will come down in Southern Power to some level in 2017, I\u2019m not prepared to talk about what that level is, but I want you to know don\u2019t expect 300 to stay the same every year thereafter. I will just say, 2016 we expect a great year in net income contribution from Southern Power. Ali Agha : Yeah, absolutely. Thomas Fanning : And just remember in 2017 and 2018 going forward AGL pops in and we estimate it way back when I think about $0.10 a year on the average, that\u2019s really picks up for Southern in 2017, 2018 and beyond. Ali Agha : And also can you remind us Arthur again of the 2015 O&M number expense that you posted, what kind of growth rate should we be looking at annually going forward? Arthur Beattie : Okay, Ali. Going forward, we\u2019re going to stick with our 3% to 3.5% number, but understand that there is no such thing as a normal year in non-fuel O&M. Looking back to 2014, I mean it\u2019s for the operating companies alone year-over-year, it\u2019s only up 1.2%. If you look at total Southern, it was up 2.3. So, lots of things influenced those numbers, but as a planning guide, I think 3% to 3.5% is a good number. Thomas Fanning : And you guys know for years, really, I mean going back when I was in the CFO rank, we've developed this dynamic budgeting process. Actually we approve a lower level of budget and then above that we developed some flexibilities that essentially creates optionality in our spending plan to match for different economic conditions and different weather such that that\u2019s why we always hit our numbers. We're able to adjust spending, when we have warm weather during the summer. We\u2019re able to do more outages and more work. And what underpins all that, the result is we have the best reliability for the wires and our generating system in the industry. So, it works exceedingly well, but Art is right, I mean I guess you should use a 3.5% looking number, but just be cautious, we'll match that with revenue overtime. Arthur Beattie : Yeah, and there is other exogenous factor that it will bring Kemper online that will certainly make a difference in non-fuel O&M and as we bring other environmental piece of equipment on that will impact O&M as well. So, I\u2019m really talking about base kind of stuff. Ali Agha : Yeah, understood. Last question, Tom, now with all these moving parts and these extensions and bonus et cetera, if you look at your company on a standalone basis and pre the AGL acquisition announcement and the financing that goes with that obviously, if none of that had happened, what kind of growth rate were you looking at for Southern sort of on a standalone basis? Thomas Fanning : Okay. Absent AGL, absent bonus and all that - Ali Agha : Well, we want to go obviously - sorry, go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Okay. I'll answer. Absent AGL, absent bonus and all the new tax law we just got, it would have been 3% to 4%. And we would have been back to the litany of me kind of posing to you all the rhetorical question that we in fact face, that is we would become way excess cash flow that we talked about before and we said, there is kind of three things that you can do with it. One is, buyback your own stock. One is, buy somebody else\u2019s stock and in the middle, buy assets. And what we have been seeing, what you've seen us do in that strategy with the buy up of bunch of assets particularly at Southern Power. We saw an opportunity with AGL not only to buy somebody else\u2019s stock at a premium that is enormously accretive especially given where they were trading relative to their peers so our premium wasn\u2019t nearly as high as what you see in the media, and especially relative to other deals and it accretes to our growth rate. And so, this thing has been a homerun ever since we\u2019ve announced, and I think our stock has performed accordingly. But it would have been 3% to 4%, but we would have been dealing with what we do with the excess cash. Ali Agha : Understood. Thank you. Thomas Fanning : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Hey Michael. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. Hey, Tom. Hate to be the one to do this but might involve been asked and answered I think I hand it off to the next guy. Thomas Fanning : Oh! No, you\u2019re a hero. Thanks. Appreciate the chat. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Good afternoon. Thomas Fanning : Hello, Paul. Paul Patterson : Hey, how are you doing? Thomas Fanning : Good. Hope you're well? Paul Patterson : I am managing. I just wanted to ask you a couple of quick ones. What\u2019s the GDP forecast for 2016? Thomas Fanning : Little over 2%. Paul Patterson : Little over 2%? Thomas Fanning : Yeah. Paul Patterson : Okay. Now when I look back at what you guys had or this time last year, you guys had about 3 and you expected 1.3%. Thomas Fanning : Yeah. Paul Patterson : So when we\u2019re looking at this, are we guys changed your GDP growth rate, and also by the way, I hate to do this, but is the leap year in this as well that's... Thomas Fanning : You know that does matter. Paul Patterson : I know. Arthur Beattie : Yeah, Paul. This is Art. I think certainly GDP is a factor that we put into our forecast and it does have an influence. But one other things and Tom has already kind of mentioned it, it is our bottom-up approach, as we talk to all of our large industrial customers and we get a lot of information from them about what their plans are, what their expansions, what new models they might be bringing online, whatever, and we factor that in as well. So, it\u2019s not just a top bound GDP driven number. So, it\u2019s not going to always match up. Thomas Fanning : And let me just give you a story about that. So, when we went from 2014 to 2015, we had gas prices on the average to be kind of in the 4s to now in the 2, okay. So there were some people on the margin with co-generation facilities. So if prices in gas went down, they turned on their co-gens and stop buying from us. That also impacted industrial sales in a big way. You\u2019re not going to see that thing delta this year, because you\u2019re at a super low gas price, I don't know how much further lower they can go. But we\u2019re not going to see that delta. And so what's remaining, this is an industrial growth rate that we think is achievable. Paul Patterson : Okay. Thomas Fanning : It is absolutely a bottoms-up, boots on the ground kind of analysis. We do check it with our kind of big megatrend looking stat. But, we\u2019re pretty confident with what we\u2019ve got. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then with respect to Julian\u2019s question on the solar ITC, I wasn\u2019t really completely clear about what the 2017 impact was. It sounded like it was about a 150 million that you guys saw on 2016 for the ITCs and then I just apologize because I just didn't really catch what you guys expected to have happened with that in 2017. Thomas Fanning : Yeah, it really depends on whether we\u2019re going to do solar deal, wind deals or natural gas. So, it\u2019s hard to say what it\u2019s going to be then because it depends on what we commit to do and what we spent CapEx on, what clears into service. Paul Patterson : Okay. But directionally do you think it might go down is that what\u2026 Thomas Fanning : Oh! Sure. Oh! Yeah. Absolutely. Paul Patterson : Okay. Thomas Fanning : And what you\u2019re going to do probably is, I don\u2019t know - I\u2019ll say on to the current plan that we forecasted. Who knows what's going to show up in the market and we'll adjust accordingly as we see it show up. But one of the things you can pivot to do, is do more wins, for example that would make it go down. Paul Patterson : Right. And that would suggest the\u2026 but there could be a little bit of drag is that what you\u2019re thinking in terms of at least in the near-term year-over-year? Thomas Fanning : No, listen. We feel comfortable about hitting our numbers that we\u2019re showing you guys. Look, we\u2019re giving you our best guess and we're giving you a conservative case. My sense is there\u2019s going to be a bigger market and certainly I will challenge Southern Power to participate fully in that bigger market. And what they\u2019re committing to right now. Remember we went through the discussion earlier on the call about going from a big CapEx number in 2016 to a lower CapEx number in 2017. That really just a reflection of where we are, we\u2019ll push them to do more. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then, just with Kemper and the negotiations on the CO2 contracts, how is that going and how should we think about the impact of low oil prices and the economics of Kemper on an operational basis given what we\u2019ve seen with the big dramatic drop in oil gas? Thomas Fanning : Interestingly, I asked that question yesterday; in terms of appetite for CO2 people still have an appetite for CO2. For the EOR business, there\u2019s a tremendous demand and in fact, we\u2019ve been approaching for get Kemper. We've been approached about getting in the business of producing CO2 from other places. You may remember way back when we did one of our early pilots on carbon capture and sequestration at a plant Barry [ph] and we were sequestering the CO2 in the Citronelle [ph] fields there. We think there is tremendous demand for CO2 in the EOR business even at these prices. And I was a little surprised with that. In terms of the relative cost of energy we kind a cover that and other calls. And I just remember by baselines here so I'm going to just quote that I quoted before that had a $100 of barrel, the value of CO2 plus the host of other assumptions got us to about a buck in a quarter per million BTU equivalent at $50 a barrel, it was somewhere around to 2 to 2.25 equivalent. And so, we'll see what happened now. Paul Patterson : Is that linear or I mean just as you know we've had a drop from there that just sort of that's what --. Thomas Fanning : Well, of course. We get that, but listen you know what and then I get the question all the time about how can you justify building nuclear when gas prices are low. One of the things we do know is that we don't know what's going to happen with gas prices. And they tend to be much more volatile than other fuel stocks. One of the advantages of Kemper relative to even other natural gas plant is that we've essentially fixed out our cost of supply. We have mime [ph] lignite, we know what that cost, so that's not going to vary. And so, we're going to be able to produce assuming a reliability profile at a very constant level and we recall also what has changed overtime to look at the performance of Kemper in the past year, just purely by running natural gas through the combined cycle unit. We've supplied one-third of the energy consumed by the Mississippi power customers out of the Kemper site. So, we're going to be able to provide reliability assurances and the regulatory process, everything is going to be very attractive. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just there is this - there have been some reports about the large coal inventory in light of the low gas prices and what have you. And I was just wondering, if there is any issue or any comments that you guys have in terms of the level of coal inventory and if anything has to change contractually or anything else you might see in terms of coal gas dynamics in the southeast because of the inventories you're seeing. Thomas Fanning : Paul, thanks for that and I want to monitor that with our [inaudible] on that. We prepare the most [inaudible] data in preparation with this when I think I just be --. Arthur Beattie : I told when you ask this I suppose. Thomas Fanning : But in fact inventory is up a little bit. But not that and we're going to be able to manage it down. Here is kind of the fun stuff. We have been able to manage down the contracts overtime. And so, from a supply standpoint, we've really shifted of course to PRB away from Central Apps, Illinois has also increased, Alabama remains a certain set of supply. So, we've been able to shift our supply. But the other thing that we've been able to do is work on transportation. We've been able to work constructively with the railroads and here is my [inaudible] data. When we talk about train sets and 2014 at our peak, we had 95 train sets moving coal around the United States. In 2015 that number has gone down to 75 and for 2016, we have 45 active. So, we've been able to take down the number of assets that are moving coal around the United States. That will serve to balance out our fuel loads in an economic manner for the benefit of our customers throughout this year and then going forward. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead Thomas Fanning : Hey Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hey guys. Hey Tom. Just a question on thinking about kind of Vogtle with the bonus depreciation. Does this is the $4 billion or $5 billion of cash include getting bonus kind of on Vogtle at least one units comes in. Okay, just one of them or both of them. Arthur Beattie : Both. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And does the 4% to 5% growth rate includes like the rate base impact of Vogtle from bonus depreciation too so it's kind of everything together. Thomas Fanning : I would imagine that it does. I can imagine need to be an impacted. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So you're including the full impact of bonus depreciation cash and rate base for Vogtle. Thomas Fanning : That's correct. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thomas Fanning : And we mentioned that in our script actually. It was going to pick up both Kemper and Vogtle. So within those timeframes expert. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Fanning : Yes, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan [ph] with Wisdom [ph]. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Hello, Ashar [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, Tom, how are you doing? Tom, I'm a little bit, lot of numbers, but I don't know if you can kind of like simplify or heard something wrong, and this I'm trying to understand the merger. So you said, if I heard in the commentary that the merger is going to add $0.10 in 2017 and 2018, if I heard it correctly. Thomas Fanning : Round numbers. That's right. Through the period, it's $0.10 accretive per year and then numbers are 9 and 10 and 11, but whatever. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. But then I also heard that you said that you are using 1.4 billion of equity from the bonus depreciation windfall in terms of investing that into this new investment, which is AGL. So we don't have to utilize it. And to me 1.4 billion of equity is equivalent to on current today's stock price is equivalent to about $0.10 a share. And then you are saying that's also hitting us by $0.06 in 2016. So, to me that implies that the transaction is dilutive by $0.05. So what am I missing the numbers don't add up, the $0.06 plus $10.0 on equity avoidance plus 10, I'm just not getting it. Thomas Fanning : I would go back to the math. I would try to do before the kind of caveman [ph] up, we were always when you think about, and it really get into an argument of attribution of shares, okay. And we argued about whether to put it all on Southern Power and say, that we are financing all of AGL with cash coming from bonus and all this other stuff or whether to do a mix or whether just to say look, the nearest term use of cash is AGL and so therefore keeping the 1.4 billion remaining, which we did 200 million in 2015, 1.2 is our plan in 2016, we have just chosen to associate that with AGL. We could have done a variety of things. When you consider the total amount of CapEx, including the acquisition amount less the benefit of cash, we could have attributed that on a pro rata basis. The economic impact of AGL remains the same. Once we get a full year of earnings. Remember and maybe this will be helpful just to recall, when we did the announcement. Their EPS growth rate on a standalone basis was between 6% and 9% and their base case assumed essentially 7.5% and we thought there were opportunities to improve that we did, when you add AGL in the Southern and increases our overall growth 1% from 3 to 4 to 4 to 5 that represents about $0.10 a year. We are going to sustain that into the future. How you want to count the shares is almost a term of art. But the truth is, the fact that we're going to get at least 4 billion potentially over 5 allows us to offset a significant amount of shares that otherwise we would have issued. The firm is better off 4 billion to 5 billion in total. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. I'll go back and do. But I don't know the math didn't work out. Second question, Tom on the more macro thing. I guess you were not the only one the companies that reported earlier, all three of them showed a huge drop in industrial sales in the fourth quarter. Thomas Fanning : Yeah. Unidentified Analyst : Is this - and I think so what you mentioned in your macro piece and I guess mentioned by Dudley [ph] last night is that the strong dollar is hurting the industrial, manufacturing side. How long do you think that this remains there, is this just last quarter or are we going to see weak numbers year-over-year comparisons for the first half of the year or could you guys give us from your macro perspective? Thomas Fanning : Yeah, man and in fact, if you want to go back and look at a clip, look at the clip that CNBC, when I was on Squakbox with Dennis Lockhart in December. But let me give you just kind of the dumb overview again. When you look at quarter-by-quarter performance, we track very closely the top 10 I used to call sic codes, I understand they're called something else now, but standard industrial classification segments that represents 80, 85% of our sales in the industrial sector. The 2014 all ten of those segments they showed year-over-year growth, so it's a terrific forward-looking stories. And then we projected I guess a 1.3% increase in industrial sales. Then all of a sudden with worldwide economy of China, all that other stuff that we\u2019re talking about, dollar exporting going down, we started seeing those segments start to show year-over-year weakness. In the first quarter, two of them turned negative. In the second quarter, I want to say three of them turned negative. In the third quarter, six of them turned negative. In the fourth quarter, it turns out seven of them turned negative. And then even now my momentum analysis would have showed that even if you were still positive, this is the momentum comment. You were less positive. Everything started showing into the slowing down in the industrial sector. Now, what Art said, it\u2019s true and here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting, when these guys, we were preparing for this call, first started coming up with the sales forecast and then we\u2019re showing a renewed growth in industrial, we had a lot of give and take and pushback and why do you really believe that. Go through a variety of factors. I think this notion that the industrial classes adjusting to the high dollar and low commodity prices. In this new market reality is one factor. Second factor, remember I mentioned before that with gas prices falling, we saw a bunch of cogen turned on that tended to depress industrial sales, that delta won\u2019t show in 2016 anymore. So, as people adjusted the new reality, like for example primary metal, we saw that go way down, we think now some of primary metal is going to grow with the - associated with automobile, with transportation. We\u2019re going to see that - we have reasonably from our bottoms-up analysis. And I\u2019ll tell you another thing, Mike Jackson of Auto Nation commented on this in some of his commentary. Other foreign operations are being relocated and I\u2019d say story for that already has been in Alabama with Mercedes Benz. Arthur Beattie : That\u2019s correct. Thomas Fanning : So, some of our bottoms-up stories are giving us the reason to believe that in the Southeast now this is probably not true across the United States, in the Southeast, we\u2019re going to see a renewal of industrial sales off of 2016. So look forward to occur in transportation, look forward to occur in housing and maybe some of the other sectors. Unidentified Analyst : But would you agree that might show up more in the second half of the year rather than the first half? Arthur Beattie : Yes that would be my guess also. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah that was my question. Thank you so much. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator any more questions? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Hey Mark. Mark Barnett : Hey guys, how are you today? Thomas Fanning : Great. Mark Barnett : A lot of great commentary in detail today on the call, so thanks a lot for that. I just wanted to clarify one thing, it\u2019s been a long one. Just wanted to clarify one thing about the proceedings that were requested by the PSC? Am I correct in understanding that if there\u2019s no kind of dispute with the staff findings over the next six months there won\u2019t be a public disclosure of those discussions or\u2026? Thomas Fanning : No. Mark Barnett : Okay. Thomas Fanning : I mean let me just clarify that and let me give the timeframes right too. We have 60 days in which we make filings with the commission with the staff. Then a six months class sorry, okay. After we make the filing there is a 30 day class that will allow interested parties, to file their own information. Then we have an evaluation of all this information with the staff and we try and reach a settlement as to its conclusion, okay. And once we\u2019ve reached that conclusion, if we reach a settlement, there will be a period of time in which interested parties can finally evaluated and it would be ultimately adjudicated in a normal course as we do with almost any rate case or any other proceeding that we have. So there will be ultimately a hearing resulting after assuming we have a settlement agreement. Rest assure to that. Mark Barnett : Okay. I just wanted to clarify that, otherwise thanks for everything today. It was great. Thomas Fanning : Thank you. Mark Barnett : Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adula Bernie [ph] with CDP. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Hey Adula. Unidentified Analyst : Hey good afternoon, Tom. How are you? Thomas Fanning : Great and how are you? Unidentified Analyst : I am doing okay. Couple of things, in terms of Southern Power it seems like obviously with the higher CapEx and anything like that it's very now production tax credit investment tax credit driven. How much of the stuff stands alone by itself. And I'm just wondering like I mean how much is this just all tax derivative as appose to underlying economics about that Federal tax policies. Thomas Fanning : Now, that's an interesting question. I mean look, I've been on record a lot. And how even the EIA would say that tax preference items at quarters renewable are way in excess of anything associated with coal oil and gas and even compared to nuclear was estimated to be 35 times was available there. What's fascinating is I think these are mature industries. And certainly with the way, the clean power plant is structured even without tax benefits. There would be a great demand to do wind and solar, just because of their carbon profile. Recall also that I think the United States in general is going to be really well-served if we pursue the full portfolio that I'm always fond of saying we're the only one really doing all of it, new nuclear 21st century coal and natural gas renewable energy efficiency. Look, the dual behind your question is a notion that these things has in my opinion excess economic returns relative to a tax policy that didn't favor one technology or another. But, I think given where EPA is going, especially with the price of carbon that's implied in what they say. Even without these tax preference items being so tilted towards renewable there would still be renewables growth. Unidentified Analyst : And do you think that when you take a look at your own portfolio and your own projects how those fit within that construct that you just described? Thomas Fanning : Well, to the extent we sign off from their in their current tax laws. So certainly if you didn't have those tax benefits they would have a different profile. Certainly the market would reduce, but for what we have I mean it fits under the commercial terms in which we entered into. It's hard for me to imagine, you're certainly you're not suggesting would we have don't have we had not had the tax benefits I mean that is the law. Unidentified Analyst : I understand this law, but I'm just wondering, how much of this is only because of the tax law that allows us to happen versus just the practical economics, okay. Thomas Fanning : I don't know. Unidentified Analyst : Right. And also if we just think about back on the history of Southern Power overtime, as I recall there have been modernizations and just like recycling capital or whatever. So when we think about capital program for next few years here. What type of modernizations or pruning or whatever we want to call it? Do you think either is built in or is possible? Thomas Fanning : Yeah so we - anything built in, okay. But as we have demonstrated in the past and I like to fond of thing we're in the EVIA shop. If there is a better owner for our assets, in other words, they have a different discount rate, they have a different whatever. Assets who fit in the hands of the best owner on a risk return basis. We're always open for business for good ideas about how to deploy assets or bring them back in. So we'll see. Unidentified Analyst : I mean I'm curious if you look back in your history here. If you never had, if you generally work on a nothing built in, what you end up usually realizing typically as opposed to a zero baseline. Thomas Fanning : Yeah I'm a little reluctant to kind of do that because those kind of deals are very opportunistic. We get approached all the time by people. We're always interested in doing what's best for our stockholders in this case. And in some cases these impact directly our customers. We just have to balance all that. I'd be reluctant to kind of give a statistic like that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And one last thing. You may have addressed some of this in your opening script, and I missed the - I only got in on the Q&A. But I'm just wondering, can you maybe update us in terms of your current thoughts about the - how within the retail and the commercial sectors. How efficiency and technologies dampening sales and anything like that and how your strategy work either through rates structures and regulatory mechanisms in order to offset that dampening. So I assume it's both in your interest and everyone's interest to try to do that as much as you can as long as it as long as it doesn't impair your ability to earn your authorized returns. Thomas Fanning : What we're seeing right now as we even despite energy efficiency and everything else we have a growing economy and growing sales picture. Obviously, we're always interested in the best rate design that we can possibly have. We're certainly open to any good ideas there. And I know as our company is considering their kind of ongoing discussions with regulators that we will think about good ideas. But overall, we still feel good about our growth profile. Unidentified Analyst : So then I guess my last I only have follow-up on that. does that mean that because of the growth profile that you feel you see economically that trying to move more to not a decoupled model, but getting more - moving more in terms of having base rates being covered, but to a fixed charge and becoming less volume metrics. Is that something that you're willing to because you like the growth profile that you're willing to hold off on or is that something that overtime you feel like you're probably going to move to anywhere or not. Thomas Fanning : Yeah, we get into a history lesson now. The industry has grown up basically on volume metric pricing okay. We have a whole lot of fixed assets stands to raise and if you were to more wanted to closely get a fair picture with customers that you would price fixed assets in fixed way and volume metrics base measures in a value metric way. Certainly, I would say the pendulum that swing more to kind of the fixed asset approach in Nevada et cetera. Certainly, room to go there. We're willing to listen to any good ideas going forward. And just remember that any pricing scheme, remember we're still in a growing area in the Southeast. And I think there is a mega trend we ought to keep in mind. The economy is getting more electrified as a result of the digital nature of the economy. And I think we'll still see growth going forward for some time to come. Thanks a lot, bud. Unidentified Analyst : No, I appreciate. Thank you. Thomas Fanning : Yes, sir. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins [ph] with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead. Thomas Fanning : Hey, Dan. How are you doing? Unidentified Analyst : Hi good afternoon, doing well. I just trying to get a little more transparency maybe into your gross potential sales growth expectations. It's a quite a bit from 2015 to 2016. I was wondering now if you can give us maybe some granularity and the customer growth you're expecting and it looks like it maybe some usage growth does that been driven by like maybe more single family home as opposed to departments or what's kind of the thinking there. Arthur Beattie : Yeah Dan, this is Art. Again customer growth we looked at last year, it was about just under 1%. We're looking for something kind of that for maybe a little more in 2016. Again, that goes back to our comment about in migration into the region. Home values around the country have risen back to a level where people are more willing to transfer sell their homes and move and they were say in the last three or four years. We've seen a number of new corporate headquarters moving into the Southeast as well. Those are having a positive effect. We're still seeing I guess a higher level of multi-family. Although that is beginning to peak at some point. So, you're going to see it balance out a little bit and I think that's part of our expectations. But you're still going to see a continuing use weather normal use erosion as you still have a new eras of appliances coming in that are more efficient. That's just going to be a natural, some traction from customer growth that we see. Thomas Fanning : Yeah, but the big slugs in the past for HVAC and now we kind a see it lighting kind of be in a big deal with LEDs and all of what. Arthur Beattie : Yeah, but HVAC is the biggest issue in the Southeast. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then on the Vogtle just the major modules, the critical path items coming up. So, I was just wondering, if you can just update kind of the timing like, what are the next things for both unit 3 and unit 4? Arthur Beattie : Yeah, we got a slide on the deck on that, Dan but unit 3 it\u2019s probably CIO3, CIO2 I think those are the last big modules that go inside containment, they are near completion and are scheduled before insertion within the next few months. Unit 4, completing the cooling tower installation it\u2019s about 50% complete so that will be done in the near future. And then you add another ring on to unit 4 along with the major modules on unit 4 that\u2019s CA20, CIO1 all the big modules that would be repeated on unit 4. Unidentified Analyst : So just to make sure I\u2019m clear, so you are saying for unit 3 CIO3 and CIO2 are probably our first - type of things? Arthur Beattie : Yeah, those are the remaining ones to go in unit 3 containment, outside containment you\u2019ve got the turbine building tabletop is being completed and later this year it will actually probably install the turbines. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then so for the unit 4 are the A20, CIO1 of those first half or second half type? Arthur Beattie : I don\u2019t have that with me Dan but we can get it to you. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Arthur Beattie : Thank you. Thomas Fanning : Thank you. Operator, any more questions? Operator : Mr. Fanning, I will turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks. Thomas Fanning : Thank you very much. I don\u2019t know whether, this is a combination of a Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting or an S session, but it was an all-timer in terms of link. I appreciate your patience, we appreciate your interest in our company. I really feel like Southern had a great 2015, we\u2019re turning the edge, value the functional risk and return, not only did we exceed our target that we set out for you, but also we have been cleaning up, continue to clean up significant risk hurdles. When you think about selling litigation at Vogtle, when you think about getting significant rates in place at Kemper, when you think about successful technical startup activities. I think the company is on a terrific upswing. When you think about adding AGL into the mix with the future, I think the future is quite bright indeed. So, thank you, again everybody and I'll look forward to chatting with you soon. Take care. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Benjamin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Southern Co.'s First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Aaron Abramovitz - Director - Investor Relations : Thank you, Benjamin. Welcome to Southern Co.'s First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Co.; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investors.southerncompany.com. At this time, I will turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your interest in Southern Company. We had another good quarter to begin 2016, a great start to the year, and we are making excellent progress on many fronts. Art will provide an overview of our financial results in just a minute. But first, I'd like to provide you with a brief update of our regulatory calendar in Georgia, and updates on the Vogtle and Kemper projects. As many of you are aware, 2016 is a busy year for regulatory filings in Georgia; an IRP filing, two VCM filings, a merger approval application, a potential rate increase and the Vogtle contractor settlement filing, which has been extended by the Georgia Public Service Commission to review all costs of the project incurred to-date. To summarize, first, Georgia Power filed its triennial integrated resource plan, or IRP, in January. The PSC is expected to vote on the company's plan this July. Second, the PSC unanimously approved Georgia Power's 13th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report in February. And later that same month, Georgia Power filed the 14th VCM Report to be voted on in August. Third, Southern Co. and AGL Resources received unanimous regulatory approval of our companies' proposed merger from the Georgia PSC earlier this month, with all intervening parties in support of the settlement agreement. Fourth, Georgia Power has agreed to extend its current rate plan until 2019, and to keep base rates flat for the next few years. Fifth and finally, as you may recall in January, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia PSC for review of the $350 million settlement with the Vogtle 3 and Vogtle 4 EPC contractors. The Commission voted to move forward with an expanded process which will examine the full project cost and schedule. Consistent with that February order, Georgia Power filed a Supplemental Information Report, which provides compelling support that all project costs incurred to date for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have been prudent, and that the current cost and schedule forecast is reasonable. The filing includes reports from several subject matter experts, which support that conclusion. Over the next six months, Commission staff and Georgia Power will review this information, which may result in an agreement this fall for the Commission to consider. Let's move to an update on the construction status of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The Vogtle 3 and 4 nuclear expansion project continues to progress with multiple milestones achieved in the first quarter. The transition to Westinghouse and its affiliate as the single contractor is complete. Fluor is fully engaged in providing on-site leadership to the construction efforts. We've seen increased productivity at the work site, including 24-hour coverage in critical path areas of the project. Expected near-term milestones include the placement of the final large construction modules in the Unit 3 nuclear island, CA02 and the 400-ton stainless steel CA03 module. For Unit 4 four, we anticipate setting the CA05 module and getting the five-story, 1,100-ton CA20 module ready for hook later this summer. Now let's turn to an update on the Kemper County project. We're making good progress on modifications and improvements to the refractory lining of both gasifiers, and addressing issues identified during the initial fluidization and refractory cure-out on Gasifier A. We are also in the process of remediating issues with the lignite feed and drying systems as we approach testing of the gasifier using lignite. In March, we completed the refractory cure-out of Gasifier B, reaching full operating temperatures while successfully operating the gasifier in pre-lignite feed mode. Over the next couple of months, utilizing Gasifier B, we expect to achieve first syngas production, and later this summer, initial power production using syngas. We continue to estimate an in-service date for the entire facility in the third quarter of this year. Reflected in the financial results we released today, we have recorded additional dollars to account for the projected schedule cost through September largely to accommodate the revised schedule for Gasifier A. I will now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting earnings of $485 million, or $0.53 per share, compared with earnings of $508 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of last year. First quarter results for 2016 include after-tax charges of $33 million related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project. First quarter results for 2015 included after-tax charges of $6 million for the Kemper project. Earnings for the first quarter of 2016 also include after-tax charges of $14 million related to the proposed acquisition of AGL Resources and PowerSecure International. Excluding these items, Southern Company earned $532 million, or $0.58 per share, during the first quarter of 2016, compared to $514 million, or $0.56 per-share, in the first quarter of 2015. The major earnings drivers year-over-year for the first quarter of 2016 included retail revenue effects across all our regulated operating companies, and lower nonfuel operating and maintenance costs, offset by mild weather and higher depreciation expense. Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in 2016 and increased revenues from renewable projects placed in service in 2015. Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2016 was modest and our retail sales results are encouraging. Total weather adjusted retail sales grew 0.4% in the first quarter, led by strong residential sales, which were up 1.4% for the quarter. Growth in our residential class continues to be driven by strong customer growth as a result of faster population growth compared with the rest of the nation. Regional market fundamentals are strong, and we expect our regional economy to outpace the national economy. The housing sector appears poised for a modest uptick, and the economy continues to add jobs at a decent pace. Residential construction spending continues to grow, driven by the integration of millennials into the workforce. Atlanta added the most new apartments in the nation in 2015, and even more units are expected to come online in 2016. Nationwide, Atlanta's multi-family forecast is second only to that of Brooklyn, New York. Weather adjusted commercial sales were up 0.8% for the first quarter. This marks five consecutive quarters of positive growth in commercial sales, and we expect to continue this momentum into the second quarter. Atlanta's office market vacancy rate was 16.2% at the end of 2015, the lowest rate since 2008. This marks a move from absorption in existing properties to accelerated new office construction. Industrial sales were down 1% in the first quarter. Our regional manufacturing sector continues to adapt to weak demand, and U.S. dollar remains a challenge for export-oriented businesses. I think it's significant to note that some of our largest industrial segments experienced maintenance outages during the first quarter. We expect them to return to operations soon, supporting our positive outlook for stronger industrial sales for the remainder of the year. We are also encouraged by certain economic indicators that suggest an improving industrial production outlook. The ISM Manufacturing Index increased to 51.8% in March, signaling a prospective expansion in industrial production for the first time in six months. New orders in production improved for a second consecutive month, with new orders posting the largest monthly gain since 2009. Manufacturing employment in the U.S. declined in March, but our service territory has experienced a strong rebound with manufacturing employment up 1.8% year-over-year. All four of our states posted manufacturing job gains. Four of our 10 largest industrial segments saw increases in sales year-over-year. Paper and transportation, along with lumber, stone, clay and glass, led the way, largely attributed to a continued recovery in the housing sector. Our economic development pipeline continues to be strong. There has been a 69% increase in year-to-date jobs announced compared to the same period in 2015. We have also seen a 19% increase in the year-to-date capital investment announced compared to that same period in 2015. The geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living, a capable workforce, attractive climate and low-cost energy. Before turning the call back over to Tom, I will briefly cover three final items. First, our earnings estimate for the second quarter. We estimate that Southern Co. will earn $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Secondly, I'd like to highlight our dividend announcement last week. Our Board of Directors approved a $0.07 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.24. This is our 15th consecutive annual increase and marks 68 years, dating back to 1948, that Southern Co. has paid a dividend to its shareholders that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. But the decision to increase the dividend isn't about the past, it's all about the future. It's the strength of our underlying franchise, together with our continued focus on remaining an industry leader through innovation that underpin the board's decision to support our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long run. I would like to note that with the five-year extension of bonus depreciation, our expected cash coverage of dividends is approximately 10% higher than before the extension and 20% higher than our recent historical average. Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. The year is off to a great start. We completed a $1.2 billion syndicated term loan for Mississippi Power in the first quarter. This term loan provides much needed liquidity to Mississippi Power. Also in the first quarter, Georgia Power became the first retail regulated utility in the U.S. to issue green bonds. In doing so, they follow Southern Power, which became the first investment-grade power producer in the U.S. to issue green bonds last November. Demand for both of these green bond offerings exceeded our expectations. As we look ahead, executing our holding company financing plan is a key priority. This plan includes issuing approximately $8 billion of debt and a minimum of $1.2 billion of \u2013 in equity in 2016. Our internal plans, which were deployed last fall, have generated approximately $270 million so far this year. We will look to supplement those plans with additional common equity, and we are taking steps to preserve several options for achieving this. We expect to issue the debt in most, if not all, of the equity in advance of closing the AGL Resources transaction. While these issuances are intended to accommodate all of our holding company needs for 2016, our financing needs could increase to the extent that incremental investment opportunities present themselves, including Southern Power growth projects. Southern Co. is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit ratings. I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Art. Following a successful and eventful 2015, Southern Co. has entered 2016 with strong momentum. Our franchise business continues to perform at a high level, solidifying our position as an industry leader in all phases of the business. We are seeing continued progress on major capital projects, and our customer focused business model continues to serve us well. Our pending merger with AGL Resources is progressing through the approval process. The proposed merger has been approved by AGL Resources' stockholders and the Federal Trade Commission. And we're making good progress with relevant state approvals, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year. We are also excited about our pending acquisition of our PowerSecure International. Subject to the PowerSecure shareholder vote on May 5, we expect to close in the second quarter. PowerSecure is a premier provider of distributed infrastructure, offering primarily commercial and industrial customers, innovative solutions to meet their individual reliability, energy efficiency or green objectives. Our business model has traditionally focused on making, moving and selling energy, predominantly in front of the customer meter. PowerSecure accelerates our opportunity to extend our make, move, and sell business model to the other side of the utility meter as innovative new technologies emerge and customers' need evolve. In conclusion, we believe Southern Co. is well positioned for continued success in 2016 and for years to come. Bolstered by the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to customers and communities we serve, we are enthusiastic about the future. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, we'll now take the first question. Operator : Thank you. One moment please for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI Team. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good afternoon. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So the financing plan with the $1.2 billion of equity, $930 million remaining this year, should we presume that's the totality of the equity that you envision needing to fund the AGL deal? Because when I look at the 2017, 2018 projected financings, you have no equity there. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's the plan, Greg. I did say in the script that should there be additional opportunities either from Southern Power or other accretive investments, that we would finance those plans or any of those additional investments with a balanced \u2013 with an eye towards maintaining our credit support. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and, Greg, the other thing that Art alluded to a wee bit, but I think we talked about it on prior calls, that we had a \u2013 I forget. For Southern Power, I guess we have $1 billion of CapEx in 2017. We're seeing probably more \u2013 a larger opportunity set to increase that number in 2017. So as Art said, to the extent we do see further investment opportunities, we will be supportive of our credit ratings in that. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Because you have Southern Power at $1.2 billion this year, and then you have that drop into $500 million in 2017 and 2018 on slide nine. You're saying that you could theoretically be double that? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, it's hard to say what multiple it would be. We just have, as Tom said, opportunities for success. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Greg, I'll go to the CapEx. In CapEx, I think we're showing that we were $2.4 billion this year in CapEx for Southern Power, and $1 billion next year and $1.5 billion in 2018. I'll bet you, we'll be bigger than that in 2017 and 2018. That would just be my guess right now. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got you. And is this mostly in utility scale solar or is it a mix of solar, wind, and other sort of \u2013 type of generation? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's going to be more of a tilt towards wind if you were going to make a projection on that. But we'll have solar in there, for sure. As you remember, we had a lot of success in 2015, way beyond what we thought. Some of those are CapEx numbers that will show up in 2016. Some \u2013 and remember, now that we've had the extension on the tax preference item, some of that could push over into 2017. So you'll still see solar, you will see more wind than we've traditionally done in the past, would be my guess. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got you. Got you. I was looking at the wrong slide. I should've been on slide 16, sorry. So the \u2013 and you guys talked about a sort of a $300 million earnings contribution from \u2013 on the last earnings call from... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Southern Power. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : ...Southern Power this year. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : And you sort of weren't certain whether that was a sustainable level of spending, but you seem much more confident now than you were on that last call relative to this \u2013 am I implying too much there in terms of the sustainability of the earnings contribution with Southern Power given this CapEx outlook? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So remember, it's hard to track because you'll spend money and then net income will show in a current year. I wouldn't go overboard on CapEx contribution and one \u2013 mean net income contribution in one year equaling net income in the next year. What I will say is I am reasonably confident that we're going to spend more CapEx, and therefore, you should see net income contributions be a little bit better, and recall, than what we've had in our kind of base case. And what you recall is to the extent there is more of a tilt towards wind, those are kind of 10-year production tax credits as opposed to the single shot you get from solar. So the net income profile following that CapEx investment will look a little different. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Overall, we're seeing a very bullish market for Southern Power. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Awesome. One more question, then I'll cede the phone. Can you talk about the earnings ramifications of the deal, the AGL settlement in Georgia for Georgia Power? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We expect Georgia Power to perform consistently with the past. It's going to be a lot of hard work, but Art got some data, but I think, look, when we see Georgia, probably among all the states in the Southeast, seven, eight dynamite kind of relative economic performance, and I think Georgia has traditionally shown that they've been able to hit their targets in all levels of performance; operations, customer satisfaction, safety, including earnings. And I think Paul Bowers that runs that business and his team has shown their ability to hit their target very well. We think it is manageable. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Greg, I think it's important to note that the Vogtle NCCR tariff will remain in place. So that will \u2013 that's not part of the rate extension plan. With the economy being very strong in Georgia, with no major capital additions such as new environmental needing recovery, they think that the rate plan extension is manageable during that timeframe. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Fantastic, guys. Have a great day. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. You, too. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Julien, how are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Good. They got my name right there. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : (24:48) I don't know. At least I got it right. Thanks for joining us today. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Thank you, rather. So perhaps a follow-up on Greg's last question, just to hit you with this quickly. Why a little bit more wind in the mix rather than solar? Just to pick on that before going to another thing. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Just opportunity set is bigger. I think with the extension of the PTCs, we're seeing a lot of interest there. I think you also see certain state kind of policy level encouragements. You're seeing companies getting ahead of the Clean Power Plan. We're just seeing a good market for it. And remember, as we have shown in our solar business so far, the fact that we can strike good, strategic relationships with developers, you recall the one that we've done the most, this is within solar, is First Solar... Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Recurrent. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Recurrent has been a great partnership. We're starting to strike those same relationships in the wind business. And so we kind of have a favored position to be able to strike large-scale deals. We are seeing that develop. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Excellent. And then turning over to the Vogtle side of things just quickly. You talk about, I suppose, a potential for a deal this \u2013 agreement this fall. Could you elaborate on what you need to see to get there? Just what are kind of the key milepost, more importantly? Perhaps some of the sticking points or moving pieces? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, this process is set up, and most discussions of this nature are best held in a quiet form. Let the company and the staff evaluate all the evidence in front of them, and come up with what we believe will be a constructive result. That will then get presented to the Commission, the Commission will undertake whatever is necessary to approve it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then just turning to the PowerSecure deal. Congratulations, moving in a new direction. Just curious, how do you think about that in the context of the earnings of Southern Power and where you want to scale that business? I mean, how should we think about that, call it tomorrow after you close, but then years down the line as part of the growth trajectory? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It certainly contributes to our growth trajectory, but it's a really small deal. Despite its small size, we think it is important for us to learn. See, I don't really view this as a new business. What I've been saying pretty consistently is that this notion of evolving the make, move, and sell, then pass electricity through a meter into where, because of technology enabling, because of customer requirements, think data centers or other customers in the industrial or commercial space which have enormous reliability requirements, which is necessary in this kind of new kind of digital community we find ourselves in, look, I think this is just a natural evolution of \u2013 particularly in areas where they are challenged with reliability or price or service, for customers to want us to provide them solutions. So this is \u2013 we may do some business in our territory, be glad to do it, we'll probably do it under the brand of the operating companies, and we had done some of this already. But I think the ability to grow this business, to learn in markets other than our own, will be positive for us all. It will add to our earnings trajectory, I don't think it will be enormous because of the small size of this thing initially, but I think it certainly enhances our ability to compete in the future. And we're very excited about it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you, gentleman. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, my friend. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jim. How are you? James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Awesome. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Perfect. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Jim, buddy. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey. Hey, Art. Can you just talk a little bit about how your thinking is evolving with the equity needs? I know the $1.2 billion, how much of that is broken down between internal plans versus the external dribble? Could you refresh my memory? And at valuations at these levels, why don't you just go out and issue the rest of the equity right now? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jim, and I think we've said this pretty consistently since the announcement of AGL last August, was that we'll consider all of our options as we move through. We began with internal programs, but we always have the option in front of us to raise the equity in different ways. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And switching over to the dividend, congratulations on that, but when is it time to actually start bumping up the growth rate instead of just the absolute dollar amount of the dividend? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we talked about that. I want to say when we announced the AGL deal, given our belief in the growth contribution from AGL, recall, we increased our corporate expectation, our long-term growth rate from 3% to 4% to 4% to 5%. And what we said back then was, of course, this is the purview of the board and it is ultimately their decision, but we saw a pathway to increase the rate of growth from $0.07 in a year to $0.08 in a year. And recall, as Art mentioned in his comments, even since then, because of bonus depreciation and everything else, we are substantially better from a cash flow coverage standpoint than we were. So, the financial integrity underlying that decision even to increase the rate of growth of our dividends has improved since we spoke to you by 10%. It's over kind of recent historical averages by 20%. So if anything, our ability to do that as measured purely by financial integrity is even higher than what we suggested. So I think we'll keep it right there for now... James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ...and look forward to the rest of the year. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey, and then one last thing on Vogtle. I know we're getting a little out of our skis here, but when do you think it's time to decide whether or not you take bonus depreciation on those two new units? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We are. That's in the plan. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Just making sure. Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ali, good afternoon. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good afternoon, Tom and Art. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question, going into the quarter, you guys have budgeted $0.53 for Q1. You ended up at $0.58. Where would you say things that came out better than your original expectations? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Ali, it's pretty simple. You break it down, most \u2013 about half of it came out of the operating companies and half of it came out of Southern Power. We announced a couple of new projects on Southern Power that weren't in the plan at least in terms of the first quarter. And then with the OPCOs, there are a lot of moving parts there. We had, obviously, a headwind on weather. It was $0.02 below normal from an expected perspective, but we offset that with non-fuel O&M and some other moving parts that gave us the other piece of the $0.05 of outperformance. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And on that non-fuel O&M, you've been fairly consistent talking about that growing, call it, 3% or so on an annual basis. But it was actually down in the first quarter. So how should we be thinking about that from a full-year perspective? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think on the full year, you're going to see the whole measure of it. In the first quarter of last year, we had a lot of outages going on versus not so many this year. So that's a big driver. But as you do your plan, I think we're still in that range of 3% to 3.5% growth. But remember that there's never such a thing as a normal year of \u2013 for non-fuel O&Ms. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. And just remember, our historic \u2013 I mean, ever since, I guess \u2013 well, certainly since I've been CFO here, so that spans quite a bit of time and even before that a little bit, we've always had this ability to \u2013 we have a flexible budgeting system here that takes out the volatility of weather. So, we've been able \u2013 I think we're one of two companies in history, anyway \u2013 there's no promise for the future \u2013 where we have always hit our earnings. Now, again, I can't promise that or the lawyers will throw me in jail, but we have been able to demonstrate our ability to manage our spending, and at the same time, show industry-leading reliability and customer service kind of statistics. The other challenge, Ali, which is kind of interesting, is as we now have committed to hold Georgia Power's rates flat through 2019, there is likely to be some impact on O&M. But remember, it's not going to be done just with O&M. It's the economic growth. And we believe this all to be manageable. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, as you pointed out, on a weather-normalized basis, first quarter was up 0.4%. You guys have been budgeting 1.1% for the year. Is that still a good target for the year? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, call it a percent, and we beat our PhDs in Economy here. They're really good guys here \u2013 we have a great staff \u2013 beat them up unmercifully getting ready for the call. They absolutely believed that from a bottoms-up analysis, when we look at some of our major customers, particularly in the chemical sector and then some other large sectors, with the outages that were undertaken, as those outages now go away, we'll see industrial production and sales return to where we thought they would be. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And last question, Tom. Can you remind me, the year guidance you have out there, $2.76 to $2.88, had that assumed that AGL would close sometime this year and contribute? And if not... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: ...does that give you some extra cushion within this year if you close AGL before year end? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, we \u2013 yeah, we have evaluated that without AGL. And remember, we said that AGL is kind of an interesting animal for this year. They get most of their earnings in the first half of the year. We're going to close probably in the second half of the year. So their earnings to Southern won't be much at all. When we gave you that guidance, that was ex-AGL. So you'll see AGL start to contribute in 2017 and beyond. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. So coming in perhaps even earlier than expected wouldn't really move the needle for the bottom line this year. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I would focus on Southern standalone for this year. And then, we'll certainly give you new numbers for next year. And we've already kind of indicated what the contribution on the margin will be from AGL 2017, 2018, 2019. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon. Tom, how are you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Super. Hope you're well. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I am, thank you. It seems as though you're getting a bigger opportunity set around Southern Power with the renewable. And you've kind of talked about this in the past, but what's the right size from a percentage standpoint of earnings for Southern Power to be? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so if I remember this right, they are currently around 6%, somewhere around there. We think very easily, we could take Southern Power to about a 10% number. And recall, 10% would include AGL. So the net income contribution could really grow pretty high if you're just talking about an appetite kind of number. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. So you've got some runway there. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : A lot of runway. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And you said you think Southern Power will do about $300 million of net income this year? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just a little... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And the other thing \u2013 hey, excuse me, Paul, just real quick. Everybody should just remember that this isn't a merchant business, this isn't something that lives and dies in the so-called organized markets. We do long-term bilateral contracts, credit-worthy counterparties, no fuel risk, no transmission risk. This is a credit quality kind of profile similar to our own. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just what's happening in the A-trains and B-trains? What's the current state, just review that? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so \u2013 yeah, yeah, yeah. So, we're actually reasonably happy with our progress. The refractory repair on A actually has taken longer, and there's been a few more things we found with refractory. They're called \u2013 I forget what they call them, rat holes or something like that. But we've gone in and evaluated. So it's really, it \u2013 and this is not a high tech kind of operation. It's just in a fairly closed space, hour-intensive thing. And really, the schedule of A is really what had pushed out kind of from August to September. The schedule of B has been delayed some weeks, but we still believe that we will have syngas and ultimately, electricity this summer. We're very happy with the way that's going. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So B has been brought up to temperature and any hotspots have been addressed? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then on your prepared remarks, you said something about the syngas, some issues that you found. What's happening there? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not aware of that. I don't think we've \u2013 we haven't made syngas yet. The other stuff that you may be remembering, let me kind of \u2013 I'm trying to remember what you're referring to. Lignite dryers had been one. But that's been something we've talked about for some time, and again, you've got to remember the lignite is essentially 40% moisture. So as we move the lignite from the field into the plant, it goes through a process where we essentially remove the moisture. In fact, one of the cool environmental aspects of this plant is that it actually produces water. We capture the evaporation and use it in the plant. One of the feeders for the lignite dryer had blades, if you can imagine, like an old-timey \u2013 I always use these metaphors, but it's like an old-timey, non-power lawnmower where you would push behind it and it would actually feed the lignite into the plant. What we've done is expanded the distance of the blades of that feeder that would allow us not to experience clumping and some other thing. So it's just stuff like that we continue to work through and in a rather pedantic manner. And that's really what startup is all about. You operate certain areas of the plant and we make improvements where we see capable. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mark. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : I know you can't talk to specifically about any figures, and you kind of touched on the subject of managing around a settlement at Georgia Power a little bit already. But I am curious, given the size of the annual investment that you're making there, and again, some of the investments that you're making for growth. Outside of the nuclear recovery and kind of the other ongoing cost recovery mechanisms, what are your principal levers on the O&M front, on the capital front, for managing under that? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So outside of capital, you're asking what levers would we pull to manage O&M, essentially? Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Well, O&M, yeah, and outside of capital that you kind of get the more concurrent recovery on. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, that's outside a clause. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Right. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, so, obviously, I think one of the things anybody would look at in terms of looking at O&M first, as you have seen demonstrated with us in the past, we put an enormous priority on giving for our customers, the best reliability in the United States, and we've demonstrated that for years. So one of the areas that we look at is attacking from an O&M standpoint, non-reliability related areas. So that would go to overhead. Any sort of thing in terms of corporate governance or those kinds of things. We think we have some capability to effectively manage reducing overhead inside our financial plan. And that's both at the parent and at the operating company. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mark, I think you also need to think about it from a capital perspective, and bonus depreciation will certainly give a little headroom to that opportunity. But as you look forward to 2019, that should be concurrent with the time when Unit 3 of Vogtle comes online, so it all fits pretty nicely into a plan as we move out in time. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : And could you remind me, with the settlement with Georgia, is there anything in there that you'd have to go back and re-examine, if you had like a timing delay from another approval, or is it pretty much Georgia is kind of set and tied up at this point? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : If you look at the regulatory calendar and those five items I enumerated earlier, I think we're pretty well committed to the three-year deferral. And I think that given everything we've talked about, we can perform as we have in the past within that construct. I think we're in good shape in terms of evaluating everything else. The \u2013 I think AGL is behind us and Georgia. I think we're in good shape. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research : Okay. Appreciate that, guys. Thanks. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Hey, how are you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Super, I hope you're well. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I'm okay. So... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Come on, you got to do better than that. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Oh, okay. The sales on slide seven, do those \u2013 were those adjusted for leap year or not? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then with respect to the changes and everything that's going on at Kemper, how do you guys \u2013 I mean, do you guys still feel comfortable about the 2012 CPCN and operationally being able to bring the plant on \u2013 I mean, is there anything that \u2013 I mean, I know there are obviously delays and what have you, but in terms of what you've seen so far, and I know there's testing to be completed and what have you. But so far, do you see anything that gives you any pause in terms of being able to have the plant operationally active (45:59) as you guys had planned on? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Yeah, no. And I think one of the things that I think is distinguished by our operation at Mississippi in Kemper County plant (46:09), sometimes painfully, is that getting it done right the first time is really important to us. We're not going to rush and try and slam this thing in. And what we will do is essentially demonstrate a reasonable history of reliable commercial operations and then file the rate case. We think that's the right way to go. And we continue to do everything along the way. So this hasn't just been, oh, something broke and let's fix it. We are making improvements along the way. For example, one of the things that we demonstrated beautifully during 2015 is our ability to run that plant on natural gas. It provided, I don't know, 40% of the energy to the citizens of Mississippi Power \u2013 or the customers of Mississippi Power, and did so in an extremely economic way. So as you think about the ability for that plant to provide not only electricity from syngas, but in a dual fuel sort of way to provide a really high level of reliability by supplementing any outages or whatever with natural gas-fired electricity, it's exceedingly attractive, and in my opinion, more than meets the obligations we're setting forth when this plant was originally ordered. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. The rat holes and the corrosion... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : ...was there \u2013 I mean, we've heard about this with other similar operations. Is there any issue there that's changed at all? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I mean, we fixed it. But \u2013 so remember, there were some gaps from these nozzles. If you can imagine the riser \u2013 remember this thing \u2013 I always view it as a letter D, is what it looks like. And the riser is essentially where the lignite comes in and then gets blown up into the air in this kind of beautiful helix design. So you have both fuel stock moving into the riser, as well as a very intricate set of air-fired nozzles. What we found in the original fluidization test \u2013 even though the fluidization test went beautifully, the nozzles worked well, the material circulated amazingly, and remember, I was there the day it happened. We found that because there was a lack of seals among and between the refractory and these nozzles, some of the material got behind the refractory and the hard face (48:45) and caused what we call these rat holes. But these are really small, really small kind of tunnels, if you will, that were filled up with material. As we had \u2013 and the way you fix it is you tear the refractory back off and put it back on. It's not a high-tech operation. What has taken a lot of time is it's a confined space and has just been time intensive. And the more we've looked around the refractory, we found more of these rat holes, we had to tear more of it off and put more back on. We have not seen, to any sense, that degree of rat holing with B. And recall, I think B finished its fluidization test like in one day. So we learned a lot going from A to B. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. I really appreciate it. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Dan. How are you? Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Pretty good. How about you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Terrific. Thank you. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : So, just a couple here on the earnings for the quarter. You had the $0.08 positive from the revenue \u2013 retail revenue impact. I was wondering if you could break that down a little bit in terms of jurisdiction, or were there specific rate actions and will they lap coming up, or how should we think about that going forward? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : If you look at Mississippi, start there, we got a couple cents from the Kemper in-service assets. Alabama had some CNP adjustments of \u2013 that I think were related to environmental assets. It's around $0.03, and then Georgia had a number of adjustments that in total was between $0.02 and $0.03. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then on the $0.04 from the non-fuel O&M, I know in the past, you've adjusted your discretionary maintenance when \u2013 to kind of match when sales are impacted by weather. Is that kind of what's going on here or is that there's something else involved? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On a year-over-year basis, there's lots of moving parts there. But as I mentioned earlier, there was lower other production expenses, there were more outages in the first quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. There were other expense reductions in, say, our distribution area and then administrative in general, generally relate to reductions and pension expense and some other cost in that particular category. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then I had a question on the decline in your fuel costs and revenue. I know \u2013 realize that doesn't have any impact on the bottom line, but just kind of thinking about that, is it \u2013 that driven more by volume or price or mix or... Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's \u2013 actually, loads were down quarter-over-quarter from a year ago, but gas prices are down 31% year-over-year as well. So it's been about... Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : How about coal? Any impact from coal pricing or transportation or not so much? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would say it's negligible. It's most of the load is being driven by gas at this point, at least in the first quarter. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then just a couple questions on Vogtle. I know last year \u2013 or last quarter on your near term, you had for Unit 3, the setting the containment vessel ring 2 (52:48), and I was just wondering what the status of that was. Is that upcoming or where are we... Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think when you think about Unit 3, the next big things would be CA03 and CA02, which are the kind of the two big remaining modules into the nuclear island for Unit 3. And then I believe the other ring will be added beyond that timeframe. That's my understanding of the schedule. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : And then just on your slide, this time you have for Unit 4, setting the CA05, but I assume that has to \u2013 that can't occur until the CA01 is completed, correct? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Don't get any idea that these are in the order of insertion. CA05 goes in well before CA01. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And I think that's all I have. Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : All right, Dan. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you so much for your time here this afternoon while (54:05) I will wrap this up inside an hour. How about that? That's historic for a Southern Co. earnings call. Delighted to do it. Off to great start. Earnings are good. Our operations are good, and a lot of work in progress that we look to have some significant announcements on coming up our next earnings call in July. So we look forward to seeing you then. Take care. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude The Southern Co. First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Southern Company second quarter earnings slides were posted today. They can be accessed at www.investor.southerncompany.com/webcasts. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, July 27, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Aaron Abramovitz - Director - Investor Relations : Thank you, Sylvana. Welcome to Southern Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information and slides we released this morning and are available at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I will turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. This is an extraordinary time for Southern Company. In addition to our better-than-expected financial results for the quarter, we've had several major accomplishments over the past several months. I'd like to first discuss our business development activities, which are enhancing our low-risk, attractive return business model. As you know, we completed our merger with AGL Resources on July 1 and subsequently renamed them Southern Company Gas. This acquisition was our first major step in a broader strategy to further expand our business in a meaningful way across the energy value chain. We purchased the gas infrastructure company with high growth projections at a great price, and in the process retained a top-notch natural gas management team. The regulatory approval process was constructive and uneventful. We were able to close the transaction faster and at a lower cost, including our debt and equity financings, than we originally expected. Southern Company Gas is a great addition to our company and should contribute positively towards fulfilling her shareholder value proposition for a very long time. Shortly after closing The Southern Company Gas transaction, we announced a strategic venture with Kinder Morgan, in which we agreed to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Natural Gas pipeline system. Subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review, we anticipate the transaction will be completed by the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of this year. This is precisely the type of natural gas infrastructure strategy we've discussed for almost two years, and we view this venture as an ideal complement to the newly expanded Southern Company. With natural gas being one of the United States' dominant energy solutions for the future, the industrial logic of this transaction is completely clear. And there's hopefully more to come. Kinder Morgan is a recognized leader in natural gas pipeline development. Our two companies have identified a variety of specific growth opportunities which we expect to benefit those customers and investors. As those opportunities come to fruition, we will update you on their details. Earlier in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of PowerSecure, a company known for its proprietary distributed infrastructure expertise. PowerSecure has a national footprint and continues to grow rapidly and expand its high-profile customer roster. We are impressed with the way in which PowerSecure is deploying its proprietary technologies and innovative customer-focused solutions to strengthen an already stellar reputation. This business is a way to play offense in the energy efficiency/distributed infrastructure sector, extending our customer-focused business model beyond the meter. Lastly, I'd like to highlight Southern Power's most recent successes. In our first quarter earnings call, we shared our belief that the potential pipeline for renewable projects was larger than originally anticipated. Since then, Southern Power has continued to find value-accretive renewable projects that benefit 2016 and beyond. Already this year, Southern Power has announced 278 megawatts of new solar projects and 43 megawatts of new wind projects. And we anticipate more to come. Art will highlight 2016 CapEx expectations in just a few minutes, but I want to reinforce two points we've made before. First, in the years ahead, we expect to pivot to a greater focus on wind projects, with the reemergence of gas projects within the next few years. Second, much of the additional growth capital this year will be invested to bring us growth in 2017 and beyond. Let's turn now to an update on our major construction projects. First, the Kemper IGCC. Almost two weeks ago, we achieved our most significant milestone to-date, with the first lignite feed and the production of syngas on Gasifier B. This was a major accomplishment. This first production of syngas involved the operation of the front end of the plant, which includes many first-of-a-kind components related to TRIG gasification technology. This milestone is significant, as it validates the TRIG technology at a commercial scale. We've also proven the back-end of the plant; the combined cycle units operating reliably on natural gas. Significant testing activities are in progress and are scheduled to continue over the coming days, leading to the initial production of electricity using syngas in combustion turbine B expected towards the end of next week. Accomplishing this next milestone will likely present challenges, as the plant's 14 operational systems must be integrated for the first time. We have previously disclosed that both units A and B of the facility are expected to be fully integrated and in service by the end of September. We're closely monitoring these next critical steps in the start-up schedule, and we expect to learn a lot. We will reflect any necessary schedule adjustments in our second quarter 10-Q. Let's move on to an update on the construction status of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Construction on Units 3 and 4 remains on track and productivity continues to improve as Westinghouse has effectively leveraged the construction expertise of its subcontractor, Fluor. The contractor has reaffirmed its confidence in the schedule and several new work fronts have been established with many critical areas implementing 24-hour coverage of craft labor to maintain the productivity momentum. The nuclear island containment building with all six major modules now installed remains the critical path for Unit 3 construction. We expect the remainder of the year to include a number of major milestones for Unit 3, including the setting of Ring 2 on the Containment Vessel, placement of the Reactor Vessel and initial energization. Meanwhile, Unit 4 is progressing especially well with the lessons learned from Unit 3 and have resulted in measurable productivity improvements. Early on, we highlighted the NRC's ITAAC process, which stands for inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria, as an area of key focus for the project. We began submitting ITAAC Closure Notices to the NRC in 2015, and the pace will more than triple in 2016. Thus far, this process is right on track, and all indications are that the NRC has done everything necessary to prepare to support this effort going forward. On the regulatory front, we expect a vote on VCM-14 in August and the filing of VCM-15 shortly thereafter. The prudence process is ongoing with Georgia Power and the PSC (9:45) expected to report to the Georgia Public Service Commission by mid-October. I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Tom. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2016, earning $0.68 per share compared to $0.69 per share in the second quarter of 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 we earned $1.21 a share compared with $1.25 a share for the same period in 2015. Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the second quarter of 2016 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 were $0.77 and $1.35 per share, respectively. This compares with $0.71 per share and $1.28 per share for the same periods in 2015. Major earnings drivers for the second quarter of 2016 included retail revenue effects at Southern Company's traditional operating companies and lower non-fuel operating and maintenance costs offset by lower usage across all customer classes, higher depreciation and amortization expense and higher interest expense. Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in 2016 and increased revenues from renewable projects previously placed in service in 2015 and in the first half 2016. Moving now to an economic and sales review for the second quarter. U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. The service sectors are generally doing well, driven by strong consumer spending and a relatively robust labor market. Real GDP rose 1.1% in the first quarter of this year and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's current forecast for real GDP growth in 2016 is 2.4%. Overall, market fundamentals are positive and job gains remain fairly robust. Total weather-adjusted retail sales are down 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015 and down 0.5% year-to-date. A combination of shifting economics and the replacement of old equipment with more energy efficient devices and appliances appears to be negatively impacting usage in our residential and commercial customer classes, outweighing positive economic trends. The manufacturing sector remains challenged by global headwinds, including the strength of the U.S. dollar and volatility in commodity prices, which have hit energy-related industries especially hard. Also, worldwide event risk appears to be inhibiting major commitments of capital by many industrial customers. Weather-adjusted residential sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter of 2016, but are up 0.6% year-to-date. Residential sales growth continues to be driven by strong customer growth exceeding both expectations and actual growth in recent years. Conversely, residential use per customer is constrained by a higher influx of multi-family construction as well as the replacement of old equipment with newer and more energy-efficient devices and appliances. Weather-adjusted commercial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of 2016 after five consecutive quarters of positive growth and are down 0.6% year-to-date. Year-to-date, we've added 3,300 new commercial customers versus 2,300 at this same juncture in 2015. These healthy customer growth trends are running counter to decreased energy demand related to eCommerce growth and lighting retrofits utilizing LED technologies. Industrial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of this year and are down 1.5% year-to-date. Sales continued to be negatively influenced by stagnant global demand, weaker, albeit recovering, energy prices and a strong dollar. We are encouraged, however, by a variety of positive indicators. Manufacturing employment in the Southeast continues to outpace the rest of the nation, with manufacturing employment up 1.4% year-over-year. The ISM Manufacturing Index has risen in five of the past six months, jumping to 53.2 in June, the highest since February of 2015. Our stone, clay, and glass and lumber segments continue to outperform compared to 2015 on a year-to-date basis, as these segments continue to benefit from the housing recovery in our region. Economic development activity remains fairly robust, with a 166% increase in new jobs announced year-to-date and healthy capital spending across our region. The pipeline of active projects is on pace with 2015. However, despite an increase in the number of prospective jobs, potential investment seems to be slowing. Political and economic uncertainty, both domestic and abroad, along with the continued strength of the dollar appear to be hindering business investment decisions in both the industrial and commercial sectors. As we've stated before, we remain encouraged that the geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living, a capable workforce, an attractive climate and low-cost energy. We believe all these factors continue to merit cautious optimism. Before turning the call back to Tom, I want to briefly cover a few final items. First, our earnings estimate for the third quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $1.16 per share in the third quarter of 2016, excluding any impact from Southern Company Gas and the related acquisition debt cost, as well as our investment in SONAT and the related financing cost. Earlier, Tom addressed the continued success that Southern Power has had in developing its project pipeline in 2016. Because of that success, we are updating our forecast for Southern Power capital expenditures for 2016, including $500 million of placeholders for additional projects. Of the capital investments identified thus far in 2016, $2.5 billion is for solar projects and, consistent with our pivot toward wind, $1.4 billion is for wind projects. In total, we are increasing our 2016 Southern Power capital expenditures to $4.5 billion, an increase of about $2.1 billion. Most of this increase supports projects that will contribute to income in 2017 and beyond and have the effect of strengthening and lengthening our growth rate. The 2016 capital investments update also includes expected capital expenditures of $800 million for Southern Company Gas in the second half of the year and approximately $1.5 billion for our investment in SONAT. Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. In the second quarter of 2016, Southern Company successfully completed a $900 million equity offering, an $8.5 billion debt offering at the parent company, the largest ever for a utility, and issued \u20ac1.1 billion of euro-denominated green bonds at Southern Power. Our updated financing plan for the remainder of 2016 now reflects incremental financing activity, largely to support our increased level of investments at Southern Power as well as our investment in SONAT. It is also designed to be supportive of both our long-term growth and credit quality objectives. Our equity needs for the remainder of 2016 total approximately $2 billion. While a portion of this equity will be funded through our existing plans, our projected to exceed the typical capacity of these plans. Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit profile. At this point, I will turn the call back to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Art. We are extremely proud of our recent successes, and we're excited about how Southern Company continues to grow for the future. In recognition of this evolution, we recently unveiled a new brand and logo to better represent our focus on building the future of energy. Meanwhile, as we execute on our strategy and expand opportunities for future growth, we continue to maintain a concerted focus on preserving the company's risk profile. As Art mentioned just a moment ago, our long-term objective with each incremental investment opportunity is to strengthen and lengthen our growth profile, which is supportive of our goal to provide superior long-term, risk-adjusted returns to our investors. We plan to host an Analyst Day October 31 in New York City in lieu of our third quarter earnings call. This will be an opportunity to share our story, provide further insights into our growth drivers, provide outlooks and supporting details inclusive of our new subsidiaries and, importantly, provide access to a broader cross-section of The Southern Company management team, which I believe is the best and deepest bench in the industry. Our Investor Relations team will provide more details on this event before the end of August. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. One moment, please, for the first question. And our first question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, Tom and Art. How are you doing? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Super. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : So just two quick questions around Kemper. So congrats on producing the syngas a few weeks ago. But we're I think two to three weeks in to when you did the press release. Are you you still producing the syngas at that level, or have you seen any hiccups there since then? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Normal start-up. Normal start-up is what I would call that. So we went to about 30% capacity, if you will, on producing syngas. And as typical in any start-up, what you do is you get a certain level of activity. You evaluate the systems and how it's working. You back it off. You make adjustments. You bring it back up. You back it off. For example, just this morning, Art, I think we heard that they're back producing syngas with some other recent changes. So I would argue that what they're doing right now is exactly what they should be doing, trying to ramp up productivity. We want to get to a level to produce electricity somewhere in the 60% to 70% capacity level. So that's what they're doing is ramping up the production of syngas and making adjustments along the way. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful color. And then just remind me at what point do you plan to file a rate case around Kemper? So I guess at what point will the plant run and produce syngas before you file for rates? Is it 60 days? 90 days? At what point? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, that's kind of a question of Art. So I think we want to demonstrate sustained performance. I think everybody wants that. We want that and the City Public Service Commission wants that. We haven't decided what that timeframe is. But we'll probably update that maybe in October and maybe beyond, but haven't decided it yet. But we want to sustain performance. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Excellent. Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Greg. How you doing? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Good afternoon, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Doing great. Thank you. Can you translate the capital spending at Southern Power from dollars into megawatts of capacity being constructed in both wind and solar and expected in-service dates? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, interesting. That's an interesting question. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : If you can't do it on the fly here, you get back to us. But that would be hugely helpful. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, man. You know what might do, Greg, there, again, that might October fodder. We have, every board meeting and sometimes in between board meetings, as the kind of landscape changes we update the Finance Committee of our board on what we call our backlog. These are the projects that are coming close to fruition and then we look down the road a little bit. So we always want to have some transparency from a governance standpoint on how we're allocating capital. We have clear ideas as to which projects are most likely to provide that benefit, but we don't have a sense as to announcing in any public way right now how many megawatts that would be, where they would be, et cetera. Suffice to say, you know how conservative we are. When we move our CapEx and we've talked a lot about that CapEx, from $2.4 billion to $4.5 billion, we're seeing a very rich target environment. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Well, I would presume that the $2.5 billion committed to solar are projects that are contracted. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, listen... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Or you've got a deal. And the $1.4 billion for wind is the same, and that the placeholder CapEx is some sort of risk-adjusted number for stuff that's in the pipeline but not yet firmly contracted or committed. Is that fair? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah and it's our best judgment. And you should know that, given our best judgment risk-adjusted, all that stuff, the actual feeling is that the numbers are actually bigger. This is our haircut to get what we think is a reasonable placeholder. When we put a placeholder in there, we think we're going to be able to execute on it. Every one of these projects has a term structure. In other words, long-term bilateral contracts, credit-worthy counter party. We're sticking to our investment thesis. So we don't like merchant exposure, et cetera. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Yeah, and that's why I'm asking. So it would be helpful I'm sure for everyone on the call to be able to at least have a sense of where the megawatts are being deployed and make our own assessment as to what the term structures look like in order to get a sense of what that predictable earnings stream is that you're building. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, just to be clear, as we have said, most of our solar has already been announced and most of our wind has not yet been announced. But we'll get you the best stuff we can. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you. And where are we in the process of \u2013 and forgive me if you've given an update on this \u2013 going through the prudence review with the Georgia PSC that they'd indicated they wanted to do this year on Vogtle? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, as with any ongoing regulatory engagement, our best judgment is to just say very little and let the engagement work. We have made our filings in terms of information supporting what we believe is a very strong case for prudence. We've had the opportunity to let other people make filings. We are engaged with the Staff. We expect to rejoin whatever we conclude with the Staff in October with the full Public Service Commission. That's our current target. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Other than that, I don't want to say too much about it. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So next milestone in October. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Fantastic. I'll go to the back of the queue as well. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, bud. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : JVR. How you doing? James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Super. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah, I have two questions for you. The first one is on this financing. Do you need Hart-Scott-Rodino before you can issue the equity? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. No, we don't, but it's certainly a consideration on the timing of when we get you the equity. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Just as a follow up to that, can you talk about how you might want to mix it between internal plans and external plans, this $2 billion equity that you refer to on the slides? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Jim, really, I don't want to get into any of those details. We'll do it in the manner that we've done it in the past. And some will certainly be inside, as we said in our script, and some will be certainly an individual issuance of some type possibly. If you look at run rate, we've actually raised internally about $0.5 billion through our internal plans year-to-date. So whether that matches itself in the second half, that would be kind of close to our expectation. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so run rate, whatever need is less run rate equals public issuance. It depends on what the run rate is and everything else. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Of some type. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: And with the $2 billion of issuance, does the guidance that you had on the slide, would that remain intact, would that hold for the year? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Absolutely. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then in the second question, pivoting away from that, and the last one, is can you talk a little bit about this Westinghouse CB&I lawsuit and what it might mean either directly or indirectly for you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so we know some about it. I will say that that's a better question for Westinghouse and CBI. I'd rather not comment too much on whatever we believe the merits to be. We have evaluated whatever outcomes may happen as to its exposure to us, and we don't think it's very much. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: What does very much mean? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Very little. Not much at all. We... James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So theoretically, Jim, if I were to try and go there, what would be a theoretical outcome would be some credit pressure somewhere or somebody's inability to do whatever. We just don't think it has much impact to us at all. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and if anything it's probably a potential upside to WEC's cash flow as opposed to a downside. But ask them that. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, buddy. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, you bet. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Quick question on \u2013 I think in a prior call, I don't remember if it was Q4 or Q1, you gave a number of the amount of ITC that you were expecting to realize in 2016 of $150 million. So I'm just curious, is that still on base. And how should we sort of think about that run rate on this higher spend as we look forward? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Jonathan. I'd say \u2013 we gave you $150 million earlier. I'd probably say in the $170 million range would be a better estimate. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And should we \u2013 I mean, as you're saying you're now pivoting more towards wind, should we anticipate that that's a number that fades as you move beyond 2016? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. That's correct. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then can I also ask around the Southern Power CapEx? You described 2016 as expected to be a high watermark. I mean, I thought it was an interesting choice of language. How far is the tide going to go out? Or is this a number we stay quite close to as you look at your project pipeline beyond this year? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, man. Staying quite close to $4.5 billion in a year would be pretty notable for Southern Power. Remember, I think one of the dynamic things we saw, remember, we thought all this tax law was going to expire. And so there was this great rush by so many developers to get a lot of projects done. Well, as it turns out, a lot of those projects in order to hit the deadlines, remained. So we don't see that dynamic occurring into 2017, 2018 and all that. And remember, here's the other thing. Going back to things we've said in the past, all remain true. We talked to you about this divot. Remember that famous phrase. And a lot of you picked up on the divot. We filled in the divot, and we did that with Southern Company Gas. We're doing that with SONAT. We're doing that to some extent with PowerSecure. We're doing that with Southern Power's profile. We'll update you completely on this lengthening and strengthening in October. But that's what's going on. That's this dynamic. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That was actually going to be my other semantics question, the lengthen and strengthen. Should we take strengthen to mean solidify the current target or increase? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, we want to cover that in October. If I had to pick at words, strengthen I think would mean broaden our sources of growth, improving predictability, cash flow. Lengthen says that with the nature of the investments we're making, we have much greater visibility into the future as to the viability of that performance. With respect to improving, we're going to deal with that in October. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just finally, it looks as though roughly $1 billion of the new equity is supporting the incremental spend at Southern Power. Firstly, is that how I should think about it? And should we be assuming targeting returns north of utility returns, or is this kind of seen as a complementary similar business these days? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think you're about right in terms of the equity allocation. And the returns continue to be something that we have to evaluate and stay disciplined on, especially with a delay in some of the recognition of the tax benefit. So those returns we hope will continue in the same range that we have earned over the past five to seven years. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : On an investment weighted basis, our contract coverage through the end of decade or so is about 90%. The other thing that you should know is we performed recently a comprehensive kind of ex-post review of everything we've done to-date. And it has been performing absolutely consistently with what we've done to-date at returns that exceed utility returns on a risk-adjusted basis. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Absolutely. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's been really good for us. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So do they exceed the utility returns on a not risk-adjusted basis? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So let me say it back to you. I would say the risks are similar and therefore the returns must be higher. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That was sort of \u2013 thank you, Tom. Sorry to beat on that. I'll go back... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, no, that's okay. Always great. Nice talking to you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Steve. How are you? Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Tom. How you doing? Good. So not to test the semantics more, but in the past when you've talked about the \u2013 it was really the AGL deal, you talked about moving from kind of a 3% to 4% to a 4% to 5%... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Exactly. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : ...type growth. And so is this again saying, hey, maybe we can get more to the higher end of that or change that range, or not clear? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Steve, no, no, no, it's very clear to us. Here's what we want to do, though. Normally our practice is to kind of do our annual guidance in January, February, and then we update our long-term growth rate. And we've been very consistent and predictable and transparent about what we believe our long-term growth rate to be. And you're right, we went from whatever it was to 3.4%, 3% to 4%, and then 4% to 5% with AGL. Now we're adding some other assets, increasing our investment in Southern Power. And obviously, that all has an impact. We'll evaluate that impact for you with much more transparency in October. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Is it fair to say \u2013 because one of the other potential drivers is this kind of incremental growth off of the joint venture on SONAT. Is that something we should have more visibility on by late October, then? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So had some magic words there in the script. Basically, I hate front running stuff like that. And when we get those things done, we have some specific ideas between us and Kinder Morgan about what we want to do. As we accomplish those things, we will let you know. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't like to front run deals before they happen. That's always been our practice is to announce them when they happen. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just one technical question, and I guess this might be more for Art. But in your quarterly stuff, you used to have \u2013 you're now saying kind of $0.13 of other revenue impacts. It always used to be retail revenue impacts. So I'm just curious is there other stuff in there? I always used to view that as just rate relief. Is there other things in there now? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You're talking about other revenue effects? Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, other revenue effects really is just rate changes across our service territory. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So it is just retail. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Okay. And then just any more color on the sales? Like it's the \u2013 sounds like the sales weakness just seems to be more conservation and maybe a little bit more of an impact than you thought on... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, yeah, Steve. We'll double-team it. But it is almost exactly what the Fed is talking about. Our data is matching them almost exactly, very interesting. I just had a meeting last week with them, last Thursday. And it's this. What we're seeing in the Southeast on the plus side is more expansion, more in-migration than we have seen in the past, more than our budgets and more job creation. And so that side of the ledger looks pretty good. When you look at usage, it looks a little worse. The net effect is kind of flat. The usage account at the residential level could really speak to two things going on. And the Fed has been wrestling with this one as well. Savings rates are up. So people aren't necessarily taking improvements in their household income statements as a result of lower gasoline prices, for example, and going out and spending it. Maybe that's not so surprising coming out of a recession. The other one is greater penetration of energy efficiency. Outweighing that is people kind of diving into more of the digital economy, more devices, more whatever. Anyway, the net effect of all that right now is flat. Commercial, same deal. We're up on customers, Art went through the numbers. We think that is energy efficiency. And that could be LEDs, it could be more efficient HVAC or whatever. And you want to know what that goes to, Steve, our response to that is really PowerSecure. That is, we think technology is enabling and customers are asking for this notion of making, moving and selling on their own premise. In fact, they're obviating in many respects the importance of the meter. And so our response to that has been, number one, we want to do what's good for our customers and we're for energy efficiency. And every one of our companies has projects and programs and all that. But we want to start getting share there. And that's what PowerSecure is all about. And if you look at some very successful segments that may apply would be in the military and some areas related to that. Industrial is a different kettle of fish. And it pretty \u2013 boy, if you look at the Business Roundtable, if you look at our own surveys with our own important customers, we just got through with your \u2013 I forget what you call it \u2013 the sounding board or something. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, the Roundtable. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Roundtable. And if you look at the broad data, it appears that starting sometime in the second quarter, maybe beginning in the first, industrial companies started really pulling back on capital deployment. When I was on Bloomberg this morning, they talked about in many broad measures how durable goods just fell off the table. It looks as if that is kind of event related, whether it is more worries about economic malaise in Europe, Brexit, terrorism, lack of transparency out of China, whether it looks like the dollar versus other worldwide currencies, whether it's uncertainty about our own political process. It looks as if capital commitments by big industrials has really fallen off. I'll give you a quick data point. The number of our economic development projects is about the same. The number of jobs is about the same, within 5%. But the number of forward-looking capital commitments of our economic development backlog is down about 50%. At least it is for now. We don't think those are cancellations. We think those are deferrals. One other point on industrial. We have seen many of our major customers now start to consider consolidation. That may inure to our benefit if they consolidate away from higher-priced places in the United States to the Southeast, we'll see. The other place we've seen that is in extended outages and perhaps more comprehensive outages. They were going to take the outages, anyway. They're going to take them longer and do more during this period of uncertainty. That's what we think is behind the industrial numbers. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Steve, let me add a comment on the commercial side. I think I mentioned in the script that we had four or five quarters of growth on the commercial end. And this was the first drop we've seen in that in quite a while. We had a very strong second quarter in 2015 in commercial sales. So you're comparing year-over-year to a very strong growth rate a year ago. So we're looking into that. When we look at the number of commercial customers we have, and there's almost 600,000 of them, it's hard to get a bead on exactly what every customer might be doing. But there are segments of offices and data centers where we're seeing drops in load. And we're not quite sure whether that's they're raising temperatures in their server rooms or whether they're actually moving data centers out of our territory to other facilities. So we're still doing research on that in order to get a better bead on what's going on. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Great. Thanks. I guess we'll hear from the Fed shortly. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Anthony. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : How's it going, Tom? How's it going, Art? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Terrific. Hope you're well. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : I've never been better. Most of my questions have been answered. Just on O&M. You guys have had two great quarters in a row of lower O&M costs, things were helped out this quarter by $0.04. What could we think about second half of the year and any drivers in that on O&M costs? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Anthony, we always manage our O&M, and especially this year is more normal than, say, last where we've spent less in O&M in the first half of this year compared to last year. We actually spent, as a percent of the total for the year, a whole lot more. Last year was a bit of an aberration in that regard. So you'll see a return of some of that spending getting close to what we think our total for the year will be, 3% to 3.5% increase is kind of what I've guided to I believe in our O&M. But, again, that's going to fluctuate based on our top-line base rate revenue growth. So we always manage the business around those parameters. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And the other thing that we've talked about in past calls, recall that Georgia Power has agreed with the Commission to defer their rate case this year. So their next what is a triennial rate case will be around 2019. Recall our language around that was we believed that our ability to run the business and the levels of expense and everything else was manageable. So we're executing on that right now. So that's the other little thing you should think about. I know particularly there are some business units in the system that may see some changes in staffing or some other things. We'll have to accept those severance costs as part of our ongoing business. But we're working through all that. We still believe it's very manageable. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And just if \u2013 I know a bunch of guys tried to take a shot on this on Southern Power. You talked about high watermark this year, 2016, pivot towards wind. When you think of long term, what's you think the long-term CapEx level is at Southern Power? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we're going to talk more robustly about that, Anthony, at the Analyst Day in October. We're not prepared to really address anything in 2017 and beyond. What you've got in our 2016 plan really is what you ought to go on for now. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So what was that, $1 billion in 2017 in $1.5 billion or so in 2018. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, that's roughly it. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So use that until we update you. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks again. And I'll see you on Halloween. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right, buddy. Good seeing you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ali, great to have you with us. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question. So given, Tom, where electric sales have come through through the first half year down, are you still sticking to your positive 1.1% for the year? Or what should be the new number we should think about? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we were beating up our PhDs on that. I think we're not going to be 1% this year. I wouldn't be surprised you're below \u2013 you're below a 0.5%. It wouldn't surprise me to be 0.3%, just given everything that we've seen so far. The industrial isn't just going to \u2013 the industrial is the thing that's slowing us down there, and it isn't just going to turn around very quickly. If you held a gun to my head, I would say 0.3%, but it'll be less than a 0.5% is what I'm guessing. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Got it. And the second question, can you update us on where we stand on the SEC investigation into Kemper and when we expect resolution there? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, we just don't get updates on that. We've made our statement on that and I think it stands on its own. We have disclosed in our financials that we don't believe that's material. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then when you look at this quarter itself, you started earlier in the year, I mean, at the end of the first quarter, talking about budgeting around $0.70, and you come out at $0.77 when you exclude all the stuff. Where do you think things came in better than expected? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In terms of areas of spending? Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: No, in terms of your earnings ending up at $0.77 versus your original guidance of $0.70. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: That extra $0.07 that you picked up. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think it's mostly in the O&M sector. And we picked up a little bit of weather in the second quarter. Not a lot. But that was kind of offset by lower sales growth. So I'm still going to say Southern Power and weather. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Southern Power, yeah. And Southern Power's going to be a bit better than what we thought. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. The last question on Southern Power, Tom. In the past, given the CapEx spend and given the point you'd made that you were seeing things really come together in 2016, I think directionally you had been telling us 2016 maybe, 2017, next couple of years probably won't be able to sustain the kind of net income that 2016 will generate in Southern Power. Given the updated CapEx, et cetera, does that change? Or is that still directionally the way we should think about this? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it certainly changes. We've suggested to you that a big hunk of this net CapEx increase is dedicated to 2017 and beyond. And so, we also have talked about the divots and how we think we've filled in the divots. Our current long-term growth rate as we sit here on this call is 4% to 5%. And what we've also said several times is we'll give you a compete update, complete transparency, complete whatever in October. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, understood. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Tom, how are you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Terrific. How you doing? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I guess you've answered that question a few times already. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, but still good. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Where are we on the Kemper A train and are there any issues there to keep an eye on? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, listen, there's always issues. Having lived through Kemper, there's always issues, the unknown unknowns and everything else. But I'll say this, you always learn more in getting one unit ahead of the other and applying those learnings to the next unit. Haven't we seen that on Vogtle? Vogtle 3 has been going fine. Vogtle 4 is going a little better than expected because of what we've learned on 3, especially if you look at (52:11) plan and a variety of other things. Recall B jumped ahead of A, and we made the adjustment in the schedule really because of the prolonged refractory work on A. Remember, that was the first one out of the chute on the fluidization trials. We learned that, adjusted on B, and, bam, B has jumped ahead and been doing great. So I guess the last point I just want to make on that, really, Paul, to your question, goes to when we talk about delivering electricity out of B and then ultimately delivering electricity out of A, that really isn't good enough to declare COD. We've got to make sure that the whole system works well in an integrated fashion. And that's when we'll call COD. And we think we'll learn a lot here in the next couple of weeks. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Art, kind of curious as to why you're presenting 3Q guidance without AGL in there? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's because we've stayed that way. We gave guidance this year without AGL because it wasn't sure we would close AGL. So we wanted to be very pure about giving you the estimate, what we have going forward. AGL has significant periodicity, as we do, in their earnings streams. You get most of the earnings in the first half of the year and only about one third of their earnings come in the second half. So when we talked about \u2013 remember when we announced the deal, it was all about how much they were going to accrete to our value proposition and everything else. Look, the information value of the second half of Southern Gas now \u2013 Southern Company Gas, is not particularly interesting. What is interesting to me is what the full year in 2017 will look like, how we're going to \u2013 assuming we get through FTC and a variety of regulatory approvals, get SONAT integrated into that. And then I think we'll have very interesting fun stuff to talk about in October. I just think for consistency purposes that's why we're not particularly concerned with the second half of the year in Southern Gas. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. That makes sense. And then as you move in deeper and deeper into gas, and what have the four states you're in opined on rate basing gas reserve, I guess three states (54:50). Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Remember, yes, we had Florida, and then they kind of reversed themselves a little bit. You know, it's funny, Paul. We've talked about that, gosh, I can remember when I was CFO we talked about that. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That was long time ago. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That was a long time ago. It's one of these things, guys, it's interesting. So right now, I guess year-to-date we're 50% of our energy produced from natural gas and, I don't know, 28%, 27% from coal. With all the loads we're having now, those numbers are going to converge a bit. It may be that by the end of the year just given the demand and coal is starting to run a little bit more, we could see gas drop down into the very high 40%s and coal pick up just a bit. But what remains is that we are one of the nation's most important consumers of natural gas, whether it's through our pipes or whether it being consumed in our electric generation facilities. One of the great advantages and one of the synergies of the deal really goes to the excellent capability of the folks at AGL \u2013 formerly AGL Resources. And so we're looking to see what are the different things we can do to keep prices as low to our customers as they possibly can be and we're working through all those synergies now. An idea we've had forever has been this rate basing of gas. It never has risen high enough on the priority list of our commissions to really make a big push on it. If it becomes attractive, we'd certainly talk about it. If it becomes attractive enough, we'll certainly pursue it. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Super. Hope you're well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Likewise. All right. So first cutting back to the Vogtle schedule. Obviously some of the updates from the PSC side of the equation here are suggesting some risk of delay. What's your expectation for these providing a next update on schedule, soup to nuts, if you will? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that the most important evidence is that the contracts have a firm schedule. And you all \u2013 well, you all \u2013 we all were aware of some of the challenges that CBI was having, the hangover on litigation, the cash issues that CBI had. There was a whole kind of storyline around the challenges that the contractor group was facing. Cutting out the litigation and the overhang that produced with the settlement. At the same time, Westinghouse buying away this piece of the business from CBI gives clarity to who's in charge. And then replacing CBI with Fluor has all inured to everyone's benefit. One of the things now that we have been able to do with Fluor on the site with Westinghouse firmly in charge is move to this full 24-hour coverage. One of the things we're doing is adding more craft labor to the site to be able to hit the productivity curves that we need to do. We expect to prove those things in the next quarter and months ahead. That is going to be the key to hitting our schedule. The other thing is we have put in place in the new contract with Westinghouse incentives for meeting the fuel load as well as payment milestones for cash payments to Westinghouse and then ultimately to Fluor from us, anyway. So really to Westinghouse, that's all we care about. So there's a whole range of commercial incentives in place for that to happen. We think we're making terrific progress. We're very happy. And the other thing I want you to hear is there's Unit 3. Unit 4 is actually progressing even better. So that one is particularly important to us with respect to the Production Tax Credits on the back end. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Actually, since you mentioned PTCs, how comfortable are you that you could get an extension of the PTCs if the schedule update comes out, perhaps putting that at risk? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So number one, we don't believe that's going to happen because what we believe is what currently is in existence and we keep getting affirmed by the contractors and we have a very rigorous oversight. So we affirm the current schedule in place. And we're seeing productivity performance that shows that Unit 4 is actually improving certainly relative to Unit 3. There's always ongoing conversations on Capitol Hill about taxes and policy and everything else. I don't think we're at that point yet certainly in needing that. The administration in place so far and Congress have both been incredibly supportive of this notion of promoting the Renaissance of nuclear in America. So, so far it's Southern and then it's Summer. We hear other projects coming to the doorstep. And I think as a national priority, Congress and the administration and even the new administration I think will be supportive in making sure that happens as well as it can. One last point. I know I go on, but I can't make this point enough. For all the schedule changes and all the costs associated with the schedule changes, the benefits to customers have overwhelmed those costs. And when that thing was originally ordered by the Commission, it was going to be a 12% price increase. Now we think because the benefits have overwhelmed the costs, even with the schedule changes, we think that the price impact will not be 12%. It'll be between 6% and 6.5%. Price increases have actually come down over this timeframe. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : That's great. Coming back to perhaps where you started the call, if you will, on the Kemper side. Can you elaborate a little bit more about what those criterias or specifics in terms of mix or duration of operation to kind of get you to that critical milestone where you feel comfortable filing? I mean, is there something specific or is it broader term here? (1:01:52) Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's a broader conversation. Look, there are tax laws that's kind of a pretty clear deals with synchronization and a variety of technical measures. I think we want to be able to demonstrate \u2013 this is something that I said earlier. I just want to reinforce it. We've been almost pedantic in how we've gone through the start-up process and the test packages. And generally speaking, when we have tried to turn something on, it has worked well. There's always stuff we got to fix and there's always improvements we can make. We've tried to make those along the way. But I think our processes have been proving themselves to be very valuable. So we want to get to a point to demonstrate to the Commission on a sustained basis. There is no clear criteria between us and the Commission as what that is just yet. So we will develop that over time. And we're in conversation with the Commission and the Staff as to what that might be. At the end of the day, getting this done right is what's most important. And I think we're demonstrating that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And last question, summarizing things a little bit. You obviously talked about success in cost cuts. But Georgia Power with the stay out for the next few years. Are you feeling comfortable you can continue to earn your ROE at that jurisdiction? And then I suppose more broadly, given the normalized sales growth trends or at least the sales growth trends in 2016, how are you feeling about normalized and how does that mesh versus the added CapEx and growth opportunities we've talked about in terms of the long-term growth rate? Maybe a little bit of a preview to the Analyst Day so I apologize, but I'd be curious. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You guys are relentless. I'm telling you, you're relentless. No. No, no, no. I appreciate the question. I appreciate the interest. We are completely convicted we can do what we need to do to demonstrate our long-term growth rates and hit our tactical ROEs in every one of our subs. It's always a challenge. It's always hard work. But we are able to demonstrate that we can do that. And at the same time, let me remind you that we have the highest levels of reliability, the highest levels of customer satisfaction in the United States. So we're able to make it an and proposition. We will never sacrifice service to customers or reliability in order to achieve returns. We do both. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Julien, just to be clear, on the Georgia rate issues, it excludes the NCCR rate, which is the Vogtle rate. So it's not an entire stay out for all rates at Georgia Power. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : No. Absolutely. Well, thank you both very much. Take care. Good luck. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Always great. Thank you, bud. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Two easy questions for you. One, just want to make sure I follow this on Southern Power. The $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion of CapEx for wind, those are for projects that you haven't yet announced but you plan on announcing in the next four to five months in the back end of this year? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we've just announced \u2013 what was it, 45 megawatts. Other than that, it's all new stuff. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And it will likely have a 2017 and beyond impact. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. But it's CapEx you would spend this year? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: For projects that would come on-line early next year? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's right. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. The other thing, I'm coming back really to Georgia and Alabama. I mean, your two biggest regulated subs. Just trying to think about the next couple of years in terms of what could present upside to rate base growth over the next three or four years at both of those large subsidiaries? Or should we continue to think of them as, outside of Vogtle, kind of flattening to even declining CapEx levels and, therefore, maybe higher free cash flow coming out of those two big businesses of yours? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would jump into three segments. Art, jump in, too. I would go to \u2013 I wouldn't be surprised if Clean Power Plan resolves itself. And so you're going to start seeing what happens in terms of generation, both from ramping down and ramping up new forms of generation, ramping down old stuff and ramping up new stuff. That's thing one. Thing two would go to environmental. I would go to ash ponds. I wouldn't be surprised. We've done a lot of public discourse about accelerating our activity on ash ponds and all that stuff. The third would really go to resiliency and hardening and making sure that we provide the very best reliability, the very best customer service and serving growth. We continue to think we'll see growth. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And the other thing to add here is Georgia's economy is probably the most healthy of all of our states, so you're going to see more growth there. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Anything on the transmission side? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would've put that under the resiliency thing. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Art. Much appreciated, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Angie, great to have you. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Thanks. So I just wanted to talk again about Kemper. So explain to me what happens once Kemper actually hits the COD and then you take some time to actually file a rate case? What's happening to earnings in Mississippi? I mean, how much of the AFUDC goes away and what happens while you're either waiting for the rate case to be filed or actually waiting for the new rates (1:08:02)? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Angie. Good question. As we've said I think in the script that we're going to let it operate for a while in order to prove the technology. We would more than likely defer the cost, the operating cost and other cost except for the equity return, through an accounting order that would allow for recovery of those costs in the future or over time. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: So there is no impact on earnings from the moment that the plant starts operations til when the final rate order comes in? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, AFUDC will go away because it's in service. But you can, as I understand... Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And how much is it in 2016? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't have a number \u2013 about $10 million a month? Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: $10 million. That's... Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So that's a net income number as I'm being told. So it's going to be, what, $14 million on a pre-tax basis? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's part of our plan. That's all in our plan, Angie. Hello? Angie? Hello, anybody? Operator? Okay. Operator : I'll move on to the next question, and that's from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Association. Please proceed your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon, guys. How you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey. Super. Hope you're well. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I'm managing. I wanted to just I guess follow up here on Kemper. So the question that comes up here is, I guess you're going to have COD, you're going to be in service. And I was reading the 8-K and I heard you guys. You guys are pretty confident that you think you're going to be able to pull the \u2013 that it's going to be happening by September 30. Do I understand that correctly? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's our current estimate. What we've tried to be very clear about, and there's some new language in this 8-K that really reflects... remember how \u2013 and in fact, I'm going go back to stuff we said, boy, we originally started this thing, we were talking to you all about risks. And beyond construction risks, we talked about how a combined cycle unit has three pieces that need to be integrated, that this unit was \u2013 this plant was going to have about 14, 13 or 14. And one of the challenges we always said was integrating the different systems in this plant. Good news. That so far we think we've integrated or at least demonstrated maybe eight of those 14 systems. What's left, and we're going to learn a lot, like I said, in these next two weeks, is our ability to integrate successfully the remaining systems in order to produce electricity from syngas out of the combined cycle. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Paul, I just want to say that is really important information. And I don't think this is in the realm of it won't work. We believe it absolutely will work. But it's a matter of fine-tuning this engine. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Right. No, I understand. It's a complicated piece of... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I think I understand. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't \u2013 I read the 8-K, too. And I just wanted to be a little careful. Okay. And then in terms of the capacity factor, I mean when you guys are \u2013 when this thing is \u2013 let's assume that does come in by September 30. Should we have some expectation of what the capacity factor would be? I remember when you speak to Shahriar, it sounded like it was 60% or 70%. Just wanted to clarify that a little bit. What should we be sort of expecting in terms of the performance of the plant when you reach this \"COD date\"? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so one of the things that's a topic of conversation with the Commission is really what will be the operating performance of the plant through its first 10 years or something like that. And in order to demonstrate the early sustainability, we want to ramp up the production of syngas to about a 60% to 70% capability. Now, how likely we are to get 60% to 70% average for the first year of operation, that's a whole different number. And I think one of the things that just let us handle \u2013 maybe we can give you a better answer in October, but it's an understanding between us and the Commission as to what is the ramp up of performance. If you go back to many of the supercritical units in America, when you look at introducing new nuclear plants, there are always opportunities to improve performance and reliability and capacity factor over time. You don't hit full speed right away. We'll share with you some of that, but I wouldn't expect 70% out of the gate. We need 70% to demonstrate, but then we'll take it down and fix and bring it back. So the effective number will likely be a little bit less than that, certainly in the first year. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And so I guess back to Angie's question, which was once you have the in-service date and then there's going to be this ramp-up period and you mentioned that it was in your numbers, that you guys were expecting the absence of AFUDC, et cetera. What is embedded in your numbers with respect to the absence of AFUDC in 2016 or 2017? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's the $10 million we just talked about. That's been in our numbers. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : For how many months? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : For how many months? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : For how many months. I apologize for being a little bit unclear on that. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. No. No. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think in our 2016 plan, which, again, outlines the 4% to 5% growth, we would file a case some time spring mid-2017. And then you're going to get either rates in late 2017 or close to the end of 2017. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But the working assumption would be nothing for 2017 until we get rates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, and let me throw something else out that is important. Along the way, we keep having this dribs and drabs of extra expenses along the way. One of the things that our guys have developed, some of that is extra O&M, some of it is unexpected capital, some of it has been improvements. And one of the improvements that we have made is the capability to deliver a dual fuel investment here. So we fully expect this thing to be used and useful on synfuel. But in order to demonstrate the economics to customers, when we're not running on synfuel, we can run on natural gas. And if you believe natural gas prices are going to be cheap for some prolonged period, I'm just willing to bet we can deliver the economics to Mississippi's customers that they thought they were going to get when this thing was ordered. So the dual fuel capability when we're not running on syngas is going to be particularly important in the regulatory approval process. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So the flexibility of being able to use both fuels, if I understand you correctly, you think is an asset to showing the value to the regulators and what have you? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. We're going to still have to \u2013 yes. And we still have to demonstrate use and useful on synfuel. We get that completely and we're fully confident we can do that. But the other thing that we can demonstrate is a highly reliable \u2013 when we're not running on synfuel, we're running on natural gas, highly reliable generating asset. Remember, now that C has been running now for well over a year and a half, almost two years \u2013 I guess it'll be two years in August \u2013 and supplies about a third of the energy for Mississippi Power's customers already. So we're going to be able to continue that and deliver synfuel. We think this thing is going to be a terrific asset for years to come. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. So just finally, has the syngas been burned at the power plant at all so far? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Has the \u2013 say it again? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : The syngas that you produce, my understanding is you guys have produced syngas now. Has it been used at the power plant yet? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, no, no. No. We're venting it. It... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. You're just venting it? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's burned at a burner tip, essentially. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I think we've got some of the pictures in the deck that show the syngas being vented. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then just really quickly, just a follow-up on Steve's question. You guys were saying something about the personal savings \u2013 I sort of followed what you were saying about sales growth, but you mentioned personal savings rates being higher than expected. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And I was just trying to get a sense as to what rates were you guys expecting? What are you expecting in terms of \u2013 I don't know what the Fed's expectations are, what your expectations are in terms of personal savings rates. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, they're higher than they've been historically. So if you looked at a graph of \u2013 now I'm doing Fed speak. But if you looked at a graph of personal savings rates, they were kind of in the 4% to 5% range, something like that, leading into the recession. The recession drove the savings rates way down. And now coming out of the recession, the savings rates are returning to 4% to 5%, which is kind of where the Fed though it was going to \u2013 as you add income, you subtract savings, you should get consumption. And what was happening was the savings rates were breaking through and I think I've got this right, 5%, going into 5% to 6% to whatever. And so you weren't getting... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : They were about 5.25%. They were about 5.25% I think the last couple of quarters. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There you go. So what you're getting is more income with less consumption. And that's adding brakes to the economy. That's why the Fed continues to be surprised with even though the economy appears to be getting better from a jobs and wage standpoint, they're not seeing the consumption and, therefore, the follow-on economic driver. And we're seeing that in our stuff, too. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Thanks so much for the clarity. Really appreciate it. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Thank you. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Bye-bye. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse (1:18:55). Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Michael (1:19:00). Congratulations, man. New digs, huh? Unknown Speaker : Thanks, Tom. Yeah, yeah, I think so. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey. That's awesome. Unknown Speaker : Hey. With the Analyst Day being not only close to \u2013 not only on Halloween, but also just a few days before the election, I'm just wondering if you guys have had any kind of conversations at all with the two candidates, their teams? Any indications about what kinds of energy policies might be coming out of both camps at this point? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think both camps will be constructive. And, yes, we have had contact with both camps. Unknown Speaker : Any sense of what might happen with the Clean Power Plan or... Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know what? I don't want to get into detail. In fact, let me kind of do it on another front. I'll be appearing with Ernie Moniz tomorrow at the Democratic Convention in the morning to talk about energy policy and innovation. Let me just say this. I know I'm an optimistic person. I've walked the halls of Congress. I try not to become bitter and cynical. But you know what? I think energy is one of the areas where we can show bipartisan support. I met recently with Maria Cantwell and Lisa Murkowski, two terrific senators from both different sides of the aisle. I think they've been able to advance some important legislation. We've always had great leadership out of the house, Fred Upton, Ed Whitfield. I think we'll continue to get good leadership there. I really believe energy policy is something that we can come together on and make improvements. Is it everything we want? No, probably not. But is it making good progress? Yes, I think it is. With respect to the administration in place, the Obama administration, certainly under the leadership of Secretary Moniz, who, without blowing smoke at him, I really believe he's been the best Energy Secretary America has ever had. Very practical, very focused on providing an all of the above energy solution for America. We have this unassailable advantage to drive the economy relative to any other economy in the world and I think we need to take advantage of it. Now, we can get caught up in the politics of what each party's planks are and everything else, but I'll say this. I'm reasonably confident that either administration, whether it's Clinton or Trump, will be good for our industry. Unknown Speaker : All right. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yup. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Big Dan. Glad to have you. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi. Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I have a few just some nuances on what's already been discussed. Just on the growth that you're seeing, you mentioned I think that Georgia is clearly the strongest territory. I was wondering if you could give any color on what you're seeing in the other geographies there. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, sure. Dan, I'd say Georgia and Gulf Power, the Panhandle of Florida are probably the strongest. Alabama and Mississippi are a little weaker. They're still growing, but they are not growing quite as strong as Florida and Georgia are. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then in your financing plan on slide 12, I was just wondering if you could give some guidance as to where you expect The Southern Company Gas and the SONAT financing to come out of. Would you like for the SONAT, would that come out of the parent? Or would that come out of Southern Gas? Or would it be \u2013 what sort of entity should we expect to be the... Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, it will be issued at the parent. I'll tell you that much. But as you look at the graph, Southern Company Gas, that is truly their need for debt without SONAT. But it would include, if we put the SONAT investment, which I think we've (1:23:20) inside Southern Gas, then you would add the additional $400 million to that number. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Recall Southern Company Gas already has an interstate pipeline. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then just going back to Vogtle. It looks like you made some nice progress this last quarter. But I was curious, I know last quarter you mentioned for Unit 4 that you expected to set the CA05, but you don't mention that this time. I was wondering was that done or is that still to be done, or? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That is a good question. I thought you would ask me about Ring 3 or Ring 2. That's CA05. Yeah, I think it's done. From the information I have in front of me, just looked through it, CA05 is in progress and we're set. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then I was curious if \u2013 what's the status of the shield building? I know that's been a critical path and a hurdle recently. What's the status of that? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we've made great progress on the shield building. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Big 6 is in. All the big... Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, the shell building is what he's asking about. It was on a critical path. I think we it's pretty good progress along that line actually it's going a little better than what we thought maybe year ago. But great progress on that front. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All the panels are on the side. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : So what do you expect the critical path items then for second half of 2016 for both Units? Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well \u2013 and I think we've outlined in the script the critical path remains within the nuclear island. And that's where it will remain. That's where all the new work fronts are going to be opened up, that's where all the productivity improvement is focused on in order to meet our in-service dates. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. That's all I had. Go ahead. Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Dan. Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Dan. Always good chatting with you. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, that was our final question. Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks, everybody, for participating. Awfully exciting times, transformative times at Southern. And I think there's a lot of excitement here among the team in executing now. We will tell you all the news that's fit to tell you in October. It will be a lot of fun and look forward to that. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude The Southern Company Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone.",

In just a moment, I am going to turn it over to Tom Fanning, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call and in this meeting. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information and slides we released this morning, and available at investor.southerncompany.com. And with that, Tom, you\u2019ve got the floor. Tom Fanning : Well done for the fascinating prohibiting segment right there. All right. Hey, welcome everybody. Thank you for being here. I know you could be a lot other places, and I know it's a busy day. So we appreciate you investing your time here. We have a great agenda, I think. One of the things I want to you know has been, especially 2016, has been last 12 months hyper-active at Southern. I think we\u2019ve, from the times that I\u2019ve talked to you in the past about the ebbs and flows of earnings, from the challenges we faced, from the event risk and everything else, this is a period where, in my opinion, Southern is as good as it's ever been. And in fact, for the first time ever, we are extending our notion of what is long-term growth. We have great transparency, great space, in what we\u2019re able to deliver. And in fact we\u2019re getting to a point where it's going to be a little hard to knock us off of what we could do. I must repeat what Aaron said, I can't, to tell you what certainty what the future will bring and everything else. However, I believe Southern Company is positioned as well today as it's been in my history, and that goes back a long way. Let's go on to my stuff. So much of what you hear around our industry is not based in that. You get all day long and you live in the idea as we do, our competitive intelligence group at Southern, with models and we are trying to identify what the ebbs and flows of the Company will, and what the risk tolerances are, and everything else. I must say that what makes Southern unique is our how\u2019s it's not our what's? And you say while the how\u2019s come on it in so many respects, the bunch of pabulum or whatever propaganda, it's not, it is fundamentally important. You may remember when I was CFO, people kept asking me how can you have such constructive relationship. It is because we believe in the dogma of customers in the middle of everything we do. It is the face that if redeliver the best price, 12% now below national averages, the best reliability we do by a wide margin, the best customer service, the top core customer satisfaction utilities in the United States by our customer value benchmark survey are ours, the top four. Then Southern Company earns a constructive relationship. And by the way, when we did Southern Company Gas, now the AGL Resources, one of the things  always worried about was a peer group that Southern Company is greater in Southeast and we can just go anywhere well in fact AGL Resources under Drew's leadership and that whole chain there also earns terrific relationship with their regulators so there when we came to Illinois they talk about getting that deal approved in New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. Some of them again they already had a dead rock of a reputation of a great company and we stepped in and I think it followed through very easily. So when you think about the event risk of trying to get something approved it's not about listen they are saying that it's time to look at my spread sheet it's all about personal relationships. When you think about the relationship we have with the DOE and how we were able to help with getting more funding to care for. It's all about relationships. We are active in Washington. We are active in every state in which we do business. And we are active whether we have a transaction in front of them or not. That is the way we do business. At the end of the day, based on our values, what we believe is that we must be a great citizen wherever we serve. We must make the communities better off before because we\u2019re there. And we do that relentlessly. That is the Company who Southern Company is. That matters in long-term success. Don\u2019t ever underestimate that. So I'm going to move away from the how\u2019s, but I'm telling that is the bedrock, that's why that's the first light-up here. Then now I'm going to tell you why I believe Southern Company is good positioned as it's ever been. And it really goes to this. Southern Company have had this terrific dogma again of having exceedingly low risk, now it's now without, but exceedingly a low risk and regular, predictable, and sustainable earning. When I look at history and if you look at in on an X-basis adjusted, what have you, we are one of two companies that has in-history never missed our projections. And we have the narrowest range of just about anybody out there. What I'm trying to tell you is why I can't say that's going to happen in the future, I believe it will, but I can't tell you that it will, who knows what will happen. But some have begun, we are conservative and when we tell you something, it's what we believe and we follow through on it. You saw earnings today. We're going to have a great year this year, I believe. But its' all predicated on this model. So if you look at 2015 just about all of our earnings are under the state regulated electric utilities and we have earned constructive regulation in each one of those states. I would argue it's the best franchise in the United States. Now even beyond the state regulated electric utilities, we have Southern Power, which has provided long-term contracted business models. In other words, long-term bilateral contracts, credit worthy counterparties, no fuel risk, no transmission risk. We are replicating the same business risk in that model. You know we don\u2019t believe in the merchant model. We don\u2019t like that stuff. We don\u2019t chase that. We don\u2019t do crazy transactions. We stay right in the middle of the road, low risk, regular predictable, sustainable. And as a result, the TSR that we deliver I think is high quality earnings. Now we've been really busy in \u201916 and always smoke, we added a gas company. We added a pipeline. And we added something called PowerSecure, what\u2019s all that about. Well, before I get into those transactions, let me just assure you that the business model is the same. In other words, we\u2019re replicating, we\u2019re continuing, let me say, the Southern Power business model on steroids, good haven\u2019t. Two years ago, we did $800 million of CapEx, most being renewables at Southern Power. A year ago, we did $2.5 billion. This year we\u2019re doing $4.5 billion. But that\u2019s not going to continue. It\u2019s going to be more like$1.5 billion going forward, we\u2019re pivoting towards one. But we\u2019re not moving away from the long-term bilateral credit worthy counterparty, no fuel risk, et cetera, et cetera. The 5% there is even interesting. And I know they said 5% state regulated long-term contracted. I would argue the predominant amount of that 5% is as well. So, for example, Drew Evan, CEO of Southern Company Gas will show you that one slog of that 5% is our Georgia Natural Gas subsidiary. That is in the retail gas business in the State of Georgia. But, son of a gun, that is not a volatile business. If you look at it year-over-year, over-year, over-year, it is regular, predictable and sustainable, okay. It is not a very volatile business. The other thing that\u2019s in there that also makes up a big slog of what is that 5% is PowerSecure. You may have seen last week we were on slog five coming out a little bit of a media day, the idea of a strategic venture with Bloom. So, we invested around $400 million in the Bloom effort. Those contracts are likewise, 15 years long. The best companies on the other side, credit worthy, we featured in that presentation, Home Depot. And you heard Carol Tom\u00e9, the CFO of Home Depot, talk about how important it was to have this notion of a distributed infrastructure business. In this case, the Bloom technology married-up with the proprietary storage technology that Southern, mean that PowerSecure provides. And we think there is a lot of follow-on business with this notion of long-term asset contract. So we\u2019re following exactly the same model. Just because its grain, just because it's not part of 95 doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not staying for the same dogma. Now, I could take you through a lot of detail. And in fact, what Southern Company does, we take around the management counts. We actually work hard and I do this with my Board and as well, what we called our beliefs. Now this is like the tip of the iceberg. We actually take the whole company through a very in-depth set of belief around how we\u2019re trying to run our business. What will the future bring? And we typically look at two kind of timeframes here. One timeframe has been dealing with around the year 2025. What do we believe the near-term impacts are going to be, and then we go on to 2040-2050 kind of environment, and why is that matter. Well, we\u2019ve always tried to start with what is the correct long-term answer. And then we make the short term work. This is not a company that chases quarterly earnings, or even annual earnings. We really believe in the sanctity of long-term planning and we try to build our business in that way. Now, all of us know that it\u2019s hard to figure out what\u2019s going to happen next year, much less than 10 years from now. And haven\u2019t forbid what\u2019s going to happen by 2050. But we do know there are execrable changes that we must provide options to face. That is, we know, that there's a trend in the United States to a low or no carbon future. Southern Company is doing more than anybody in the United States to prepare for that future. We know that while the Clean Power Plan right now is under legal review, something like that may emerge. And we stand ready to play offence in that environment, not defense. We know that technology is changing at a pace faster than any of us, even as you're sitting here, no. We know the customer requirements are changing, see Home Depot. Now we could try and stop it. I'll have to say keep the ways-off the beach, or we could figure out a way to create options, not big bets, little bets, that will enable us manage whatever risk comes. We know it's coming in an effective way. There's nobody else in the United States in our industry doing these kinds of things. And I'm very proud of that. Let me go through these real quickly, you must know that there's a wealth of robust thinking around this. And we do this annually, formally. We do it regularly on an ongoing basis. Real quick, nuke. So this is the generation side of business. Let me go through them quick. We know, if you believe in a low to no carbon future carbon in America that nuclear is really important. We're proud to be leading America in building Vogtle 3 and 4. It's going great. It's going to be really hard to build new nukes. Now, we'll create options to build new nukes. But keeping our hands in that is really important. And we are doing beautifully in the new nuclear that we're building at Vogtle 3 and 4. We'll see how that emerges in the future. The next one is coal. We're advancing 21st century coal. We know we've been through our bumps and bruises on that but son of a gun I\u2019m proud to tell you today that it is working right now. Unit A is producing electricity right now using syngas. So, the technology works. We know that there's regulatory work to do to get it finally and right, and we know that's a big challenge. But otherwise, the technology works. And we're thinking about while it may be hard to replicate that elsewhere in the United States, using that technology in our view, licensing it oversees, we've struck agreement in Serbia, Romania, Poland, South Korea, China, this technology is relevant elsewhere. Otherwise, without this kind of forward thinking in terms of using coal with advanced technologies, the most advanced in the world that our proprietary robust research and development arm has created here at Southern. We know that certainly coal will ebb as an generation resource to the future. So, then you look at renewable. We're one of the biggest owners of solar in the United States. Remember, strategically, we saw that that had some relevance back in the Southeast, that with our first way to invest in renewables. We weren\u2019t an initial mover in wind because it was not directly applicable to the Southeast. And what you've seen the intervening years, certainly during my tenure at Southern as Chairman, is that all the sudden we're starting to buy wind over the wire, Georgia Power, Alabama Power, Gulf Power, all now buy wind resources over a long-haul transmission. And so we've gotten in that business. And we're making a pivot now away from solar. We'll still do some solar. But away from solar in the wind, and we'll talk about that later. When I think about now the future issues around renewables and around base-load, gas becomes a dominant solution. On our own, forget Southern Gas, on our own, we were about the third or fourth largest consumer of natural gas in United States. That\u2019s the transition of the fleet. Remember, before I took over, we were about 70% coal, 16% gas. Now, I don\u2019t know, 48% to 50% natural gas and about 28% or so maybe 30% coal, depending on the weather. Probably when our coal assets are little more than we thought we would, just because we had an extraordinarily hot summer. But it is clear that gas is becoming more important. And when I think about the future, it's actually Clean Power Plan and everything else. We know that renewables have intermittency. And we know in order to handle intermittency, we need BTs. And by the way, coal is probably eroding in importance as a base-load facility. And it's really hard to build new nuclear. And so, we\u2019re losing base-load that will lead more CC. And those CCs will run harder than they ever have. And you know our capacity factor during the third quarter of our CCs was nearly 80%. They run like champion, the best reliability in the United States. We can do this stuff, that\u2019s where make is going. And the other thing is when I say with nuclear and coal and renewables and natural gas energy efficiencies the cleanest kilowatt hours, the one you never consume. Son of a gun, we know that technology enabling, customers requiring, we will jump over the meter, what has formally been make, move, and sale then to a meter and then a customer does something on the meter. We now put make, move and sales on the customer premises. And son of a gun, PowerSecure was our bet there. We have a small bet for us. But we see a tremendously evolving market. And my sense was the worst thing we can do, the riskiest thing we could do in that environment, is do nothing. You will see that our projections going-forward for energy sales is declining. This model you will see, this 5% growth rate, is based on 0% to 1% energy sales. We are robust within that range. And we\u2019re adding 1% new customers. That says our energy usage is either zero to negative 1, that\u2019s what our model, that\u2019s what our 5% highly confident projections are based on. If that is happening, what should we do? And so what we have done is made a reasonably small bet with PowerSecure. Now we just added Bloom. And we are seeing more and more is the ability to recapture some of that share by having assets on the customer premise, long-term bilateral contracts, credit worthy counterparties, the best customers you can think in the United States, people, especially that have pristine reliability requirements. Now, at least at this point, we are not able to say who all they are, Hope Depot, came out. But think about other companies in the United States that have the most pristine reliability requirements. You know who they are, if you think about it. We do business there today. And what we are doing is building a business for the future. Again, that is regular predictable and sustainable. In the move side, we have always -- if you guys look at our CapEx program, good happens. I mean, we have for years, spent about $1 billion year on CapEx on the T&D business. And we\u2019re continuing that. We are not in some -- I remember after the blackout in the Midwest and the Northeast this was a build rigid instead of third world transmission system, garbage. If you look at Southern Company\u2019s operation of the grid, it's terrific. And we\u2019ve been an early adaptor of things like smart grid. And we\u2019ve done an early adaptor of smart meters and all this stuff. I mean we\u2019ve done that forever. Now to add to that the idea of move with a distribution system, buying AGL Resources now, Southern Companies Gas. We bought the best LDC, the biggest LDC in the United States. And when you look at Atlanta Gas Light, the LDC that covers Georgia, think about the synergies. And when you think about the notion that they\u2019re able to show a tremendous growth rate, 10% or so, into the next decade, these are under safety related pipeline replacement programs under tariffs. This is not risky business. This is not some crazy I\u2019ve got a placeholder out here. This is business we should do as America and we\u2019re doing it. And by the way, when you look at strategy and you look at more of the move segment, as the third largest consumer of natural gas, now we\u2019ve added AGL Resources, now certainly going to be a wholly smokes for the most important natural gas company in United States. We know that pipelines have been a big deal across the United States. And the two theories I\u2019ve talked to you about; one was north to south kind of Marcellus to the south; and the other was west to east that cheap gas out there in Taxes, in Oklahoma, in Arkansas, and a variety of other places, and bringing it east. And so we\u2019ve been looking for some time at pipeline deals. And we\u2019ve kept in contact with all these folks, all the time. I talk about this relationship business. Rich Kander and I probably visit once in a year, comes to my office, sit around, drink coffee and yuck it up. And among all the transactions that we looked at, striking a strategic relationship with Kinder Morgan with the Southern Natural Gas pipeline made perfect sense to us. It is replicated in these financials you will see. To us, it looks like an annuity. It is strategically located. It gives us an option for future growth. The projections you will see include virtually no future growth. We\u2019re not depending on any kind of huge new pipeline deal. We\u2019ve talked about options and we kind of know the transactions we\u2019re adding on, but they\u2019re not enormous. They\u2019re not big. You\u2019ll see this stuff later. When you add, Southern Natural Gas into the Southern, we put it under the leadership of Drew and his team in Southern Company Gas. We think that is a terrific business for us. Now, when we think about adding Southern Power all that we have a real good foundation to grow. But that is basically our move business, the selling consume really goes to PowerSecure. This notion of technology and they covers and require, playing-offense, long-term contract. That is what we believe. We will continue to focus on R&D. Before I\u2019ve gotten this job, R&D was all kind of, not all, but majority and Larry Monroe, where is Larry? Right there. Larry was voted the 16th most important guy over the last 25 years in the industry, and he runs our R&D effort. That\u2019s essential that who we are. In the past, our R&D has been focused on protecting coal, environmental controls and they\u2019ve done a great job. The R&D now has been very oriented to the future, and thinking about how we can make electricity viable and grow in this digital edge. So, before I got here, we were generation, we were wholesale transmission, distribution customer service. And now we basically occupy the full value chain. When I think again about the strategy of make, move and sale, nuclear, coal, natural gas, renewables energy efficiency, we\u2019re replacing our big best, just look at the CapEx. It's in natural gas input structure, not the commodity. And it is around renewables. That is where we are making our big bets. I think those are darn good bets. We're creating an option on the far right side of this chain. And I think it is a option well-placed. So, when I say we\u2019re in as good shape as we've been in some years, wholly smoke, we're showing 5% growth. Remember even when I first started as CFO, we were building Vogtle and building Kemper, and spending CapEx and compared to our net amount of capital, we\u2019re able to talk about earnings per share growth rates in the 5% to 7%. And then as we got bigger and the CapEx started to wane, our growth rates started to get smaller. And then we had bonus depreciation. And then we dropped our earnings per share growth to 3% to 4%. We didn\u2019t sit here and tell you we're just going to fill it up with stuff we don\u2019t know what it is. We always tell you what we believe. We were 3% to 4%. With natural gas, with Southern Company Gas, we did -- we increased it up to 4% to 5% and with sauna and PowerSecure. And unexpected success with Southern Power, we\u2019re able to say to you now. We are robust, 5% long-term growth rate. Now, not 5%, you all know that, that's a number, that\u2019s a point, that's equilibrium. Equilibrium is the point in time in which you move through. So we\u2019ll be around 5%. But 5% is our best guess as to where we're going to go, not 4% to 5%, 5%. And because we've done so much in 2016, or actually last 12-months till now, we have removed a bulk-load of event risk from this projection. Let\u2019s just go through it real quick. Southern\u2019s high growths opportunities I told you $800 million to $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion, and now buzz our estimated for the foreseeable future for the next five years about $1.5 billion. Is there upside to that yes, maybe? So that means going 5% is better. I think we\u2019ll do the $1.5 billion. When you look at -- I'm an old finance guy, 40% of my career at Southern now, I'm 36 years in Southern, I always felt I'm getting older. But it was in the finance side. And I used to say, I actually went to Harvard and did all the stuff and one of these programs. So there is no value creation in finance. Always people want to sell you stuff. The investment banking community loves to sell you pots and pans, and they tell you, you could do yiled-cos, and you do MLPs, and you can do this and you can do that, garbage. We believe in fundamental finance. I will argue, however, in my experience for the first time, the finance group here at Southern has actually created value. And what they've done we made a little bit of a bet around AGL. We did a cash deal. Now some people ran around and said oh man you are just levering up, garbage. We have reduced and preserved the financial integrity at Southern. We've replaced the equity. We have coverages that are attractive going on. The op-cos are doing fine. Southern Company has an attractive credit profile. And so, we've replaced that equity, we're moving forward. We did landmark financing. And when you think about the creativity at this Group, these were creative deals but they were not crazy, trendy, sexy deals. We rather identified pockets of investors in which to create room to do other financing. And when we did this cash deal for AGL, we replaced the equity at prices better than we thought. And when we did the debt deals, we did debt deals better than we thought. And we did it in a way that now somebody help me here, what\u2019s the total debt portfolio at Southern, how big is it? How many billions? $41 billion, 3.9% cost with a 16 year or so average life. Do you have stuff in your seat? You will show that as the best debt portfolio in the United States in our industry, hands down nobody even close. From an EVA standpoint, what a time to raise $20 billion, maybe we\u2019re lucky. But in this case, I think we were lucky and good. Let\u2019s go forward to some more of that. Southern Company Gas we already talked about. I think it\u2019s a 10% growth business. And I think that with our investment under these regular, predictable, sustainable, regimes of safety related pipeline replacement programs, we\u2019re going to continue to do well. SONAT is an annuity that gives us an option for future growth should we chose to exercise it. Plant Ratcliffe, thanks the lord, today, we are producing electricity on that first of a kind technology. We have passed the test, I think, that it will work. Now we still have to go COD, and we get that, and we\u2019re projecting today that our best estimate is November 30th. But we\u2019re moving ahead. You can see it working. And now our attention will focus to getting in it right, that conversation has already begun, how we\u2019re going to do that. And then Vogtle. Let\u2019s talk real quick. We just had a very important settlement that was reached agreement with the stats, subject to commission approval. Paul, do you want to say anything about that? Paul Bowers : This is Paul Bowers, CEO at Georgia Power. So many of you already had some conversations today with us about that settlement in page 24 in your book you\u2019ll see an online of what that really means. It reemphasize what Tom said about the constructive regulatory environment, trying to de-risk, if you will, the future of Vogtle construction as we go through the process. Go back to last year. We had the litigation, settled the litigation, which gave us the opportunity to have a conversation with Public Service Commission in George about prudence. Going through the last nine months or so, we were able to have an agreement with staff that is outlined on our page 24, which really gives you some idea of what we\u2019re going to do with this plan associated with the additional calls, and associated with $1 billion. So that really has de-risked, given there\u2019s certainty about what we want to do with this plan. Tom Fanning : And let\u2019s reinforce the head line on Vogtle that we are relentless about. It is the notion that when that plant was ordered to be built, we thought it would be a 12% price increase. We still believe that it's going to be somewhere at the end of the day, a 6% to 7% pricing. Paul Bowers : Exactly right. Tom Fanning : That\u2019s it. And it\u2019s gone beautifully. And we\u2019re on schedule. Paul Bowers : Absolutely... Tom Fanning : And we\u2019ve gotten the litigation settled. We\u2019ve got an increased cost associated with that litigation approved. Well, not approved yet, recommended to be approved by the commission. Paul Bowers : So the commission will -- the staff has made the recommendation to commissioners while take it up hopefully before the end of the year, and vote on stipulation. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Paul. Steve Kuczynski, runs in my opinion the best nuclear fleet in America now. Steve, tell us about the progress on 3 and 4. Steve Kuczynski : So progress on construction, getting it built is going very well. We are particularly encouraged about our progress on the second unit as expected. First unit tackles the new construction challenges, and we leverage those learnings over into the second unit. And we're service, as we typically would, expect on a major construction project, a very strong improvement productivity and construction progress. So, we\u2019re retiring risk in construction and we're retiring risk in operations. And we're fortunate to have the same technology, the AP1000s, being started up in China. They're exactly two years ahead of us. So, two years from now, we'll be in the exact same spot they will be. And they're progressing through start-up, looking to load-fuel here in the next month or two. And that is progressing as expected. So, we're bringing down risks on both construction and operations. And we have folks on the ground full-time in China, watching that start-up. So, we get the best learnings out of that. And the key individuals out of Westinghouse house and floor that actually built the plant in China, they're sequencing two our facility in order to bring that additional expertise to make sure we're successful. So, I think we're well positioned for our June of 19th and June of 20th, bringing these units to operation. Tom Fanning : Fantastic, thanks for that. Acquisition of PowerSecure, so you've seen the material, I\u2019ve always asked -- one person ask me, why are you talking about PowerSecure if it's so small? Interesting, how much secure is this window on the world? And we thought it was an important small but important bet, nevertheless, for us to make. And that is I'm not just going to let these sales erode, 0% to 1% is what's robust in this model. So, what we do? What PowerSecure has been so far, I call it, distributed infrastructure, broadly. So, it's been distributed generation. They do things in a proprietary way in terms of back-up generation, in terms of variety of products and services, including storage proprietary. They do a terrific job. The thing that we were so attracted to with PowerSecure is they have built a book of business with 200 firms, many of which want to remain secret, particularly with respect to proprietary technology and what's on campus, so that they maintain a commercial advantage. Anywhere these guys have gone, they've gotten repeat business. They have built a following among the finest companies in America, especially those with pristine reliability requirements that we think gives us the ability to reproduce in a sustainable way. And then it's not just distributed generation, it goes to things like energy efficiency, and broadly, utility infrastructure, micro grids, all kinds of things. So, what they needed, they were a publicly traded company, successful. They needed somebody big. One of the things Southern Company has done so well for so long I go back to customer satisfaction. Our key accounts team has been voted regularly among the best in the United States. These are our very biggest customers. And by the way, we can take now PowerSecure and link them with our key accounts and take this business anywhere in the United States. And by striking it, strategic relationship with somebody like Bloom, son of a gun, we can put Bloom generators over here and we can build a book of business now with your storage technology. And by the way now we can expand that to the full range of what is distributed infrastructure. And we will do all of that under long-term bilateral contract, taking no fuel risk, taking no transmission risk, building a book of business very similar to what we've done at Southern Power, just little miniature little deals. We think this is exciting. And I just mentioned Bloom, depth to breadth. It's been a terrific business so far. It's very small to us, right now. But think out it as a cheap option for the future in a way that beats what maybe eroding sales in this whole industry. And so I finish with this slide. And I love this. Value is a function of risk and return. This is my belief, so this is not fact. It is a belief. Southern Company has traded at a premium, whereas until we started on the Vogtle plant and the Kemper plant. So it's not going to be traded at a PE premium for a long time. And I understand with the proceed risk associated with Vogtle and Kemper, and a variety of other things we were facing, I think you can see that we can make the case that not only, and I talked oh gosh, and remember how I talked about the flattening earnings curve. And remember I use the expression the debt, the debit has been filled in, the curve has been raise. Many of the important risk factors around our big transactions have moved away. So I am still remain, I didn\u2019t miss that. But when you look at the predominance of our story, it is inescapable in my opinion that risk is reduced in this Company significantly. And then you look at return. And now we are not three to four, we are not four to five, we are five, and that\u2019s not point estimate. I understand it's going to vary around five. I get that. But from a risk return standpoint, value in our PE premium should be restored, that\u2019s my opinion. My job is to show results to you where you\u2019re going to bet on it dependably. But I think we\u2019re there. And I think we\u2019re moving forward in a constructive way. So thank you. What I am going to do now is turnover to a series of presentations to my teammates here. I guess first is, Mark Crosswhite, CEO of Alabama Power, Stan Connally, CEO of Gulf Power, and they will talk to you about the integrated regulated business. Go get him, Phil Stan Connally : Thank you, Tom, and good morning. So I present these four companies, Mark and I, and we want to acknowledge our Paul Bowers and Anthony Wilson, and the hard work they do at these operating companies. And as you think about what Tom said, the long history Southern Company has had, these four regulated retail state jurisdictions have had an incredibly valuable part of Southern Company's history, and we\u2019ll continue doing that. We\u2019ve been a part of helping create this economic atmosphere of growth in our jurisdictions for at least 90-years in every one of our companies, dating back to the early part of the 20th century. And we\u2019ve been supporting that Southern value proposition. But it starts with, like Tom said, that customer and community value proposition. And we thought we just start by talking about some of those very fundamentals that makes customers and communities successful as we get started here. Mark Crosswhite : So Stan said that we\u2019ve been serving out here the country for about 100 years now. We have been successful over that time by focusing on the fundamentals. You can see here what we do safety over the past 11 years or so, our core investment rate is down about 50%, so we\u2019re operating safer than ever. Reliability, keep the lights on. We keep the lights on 99.9% of the time, industry leading reliability. And when there is a hurricane or severe weather, our folks will recognize across the industry for their ability to restore service very quickly. Customer satisfaction, Tom mentioned it several times. We have the highest levels of customer satisfaction. We track it relentlessly. And our Company is always at the top of that, the store base. Affordable prices, that\u2019s certainly something that we know we have to deliver. We\u2019re focused very much on keeping our prices affordable. All of this focus on the fundamentals, allows us to have a constructive regulatory environment in each of our states. For the remainder of our presentation, Stan and I are going to talk about our service areas. We\u2019re going to talk about our capital investment, and we\u2019re going to talk about the constructive regulatory environments. Service areas, we recognize, and Tom\u2019s slide started-off by saying we\u2019re bigger than our bottom line. We really believe that. We know we\u2019re only as successful as the communities we serve. So, we work very hard to make sure they are successful. It is encourage, and I would say even expected at all of our companies that employees are very engaged in their community. And you will find that\u2019s a common theme at each of our operating companies. Which you\u2019ll also see that we do more than just encourage our employees to be involved, we invest in our communities. We invest in education. We invest in work force development. We invest in arts and culture, trying to make our service areas better placed us to live. Make them stronger, because we recognize if our communities are stronger, we\u2019re stronger. Stan Connally : Yes, I mean, it literally is a piece of our strategy. It\u2019s not just redirect. And one place we put our money where our mouths are is economic development, helping drive business investment, helping drive job growth, in these communities. So, every single one of us have a team that engages with the local economic developers, state economic development groups. Mark and I, as well and Anthony and Paul, all hold prominent roles in our state-wide economic development organizations. And as you can see from some of the emblems on the slide, we also offer business recruitment tools, site selection type tools for prospects considering our states. And look, we\u2019re having some successes. Just last week, in Georgia Power, and some helps just announced up to 1,800 technology based jobs at a technology center at Midtown Atlanta that they will grow in over a period of time, another example of that technology sector that\u2019s growing in the Southeast. About six weeks ago, in Gulf jurisdiction in Panama City Florida, Eastern Shipbuilding announced that they had been selected for the first phase of a coastguard contract to build their new offshore petrol cutters. The first of what could be 25 ships built like there in Panama City. So, we\u2019re having some successes in the Southeast. And by the way, as we were going through with our merger with AGL Resources, now Southern Company Gas, our work in the economic development space was one of those things of interest as we talked to the various jurisdictions about what we do in the Southeast and how we can share those practices across our new spaces. And, our pipeline for projects remains fairly robust going forward. So, we\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019ll continue to have opportunities to bring new growth and new job growth into the Southeast. I want to transition now and talk more specifically about electricity use in our four state jurisdictions. You can see from the chart, we serve and proudly server 4.6 million customers across our four states. And what\u2019s interesting is, you see the balance of the energy sales mix, is roughly a third, a third, a third, third residential, a third commercial, and a third industrial. And we believe, while this will vary across every state every jurisdiction, the net migration into the Southeast remains positive. So we\u2019re looking for customer growth of about 1% going forward. Now, at the same time, use for customer, customer usage trends are slowing that growth a bit, specifically across the sectors. For instance, in the residential sector. We\u2019ve seen a share shift, if you will, in the housing market, 10% to 15% more multi-family type customers than we've seen historically in that residential sector. And of course those are smaller spaces use less energy. You look at both commercial and residential sectors. The energy efficiency, the energy productivity is ongoing, more efficient lighting, more efficient major appliances in those spaces. And then if you think about our largest commercial-industrial customers, many of them have corporate goals now, much like many of you probably do, to reduce energy usage or transition to some distributed energy resources. And look by the way that gives rise to the opportunity in the power secure business line that we have now. Now transitioning to industrial. Certainly, we have seen strong industrial growth since the end of the recession. Now that has levelled off somewhat, particularly this year. I'll give you a couple of highlights. In the manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing employment in the Southeast has been positive. About 1.5% growth in manufacturing employment compared to the rest of United States where we've seen it go down, about 0.3%. The highlight there would be our transportation sector. We continue to seek modest growth in the transportation industries in the Southeast led by global and domestic growth in vehicle demand. On the other side, in the commodities sector and particularly the steel industry, we\u2019ve seen some decline year-over-year. Think about the drivers for that low oil prices, strong dollar, weak demand, excess global capacity, all impacts that commodity sector. But I'll note back to the slide we just talked to you about before on economic development. Every single year we are looking for opportunities to influence that industrial sector through economic development growth and as well we also know that the economy overall will impact industrial sales. And Tom has already it, 0% to 1% sales growth over this period is what we're projecting. And we continue to hope to influence that through economic development growth. Mark, go ahead. Mark Crosswhite : Now, we\u2019re going to talk about our capital investment. So Stan talked about our customer growth. Customer growth is certainly a component that leads to capital investment. But that's not all of it. We also invest in capital to better serve our customers or reduce the operating cost. Good examples of that would be things like self-feeding networks with a smart grid where we see we can make investments that will better serve customers or bring the cost to serve them down overtime. Another major component of our capital investment will be compliance cost, especially environmental compliance. And as you see the chart down at the bottom, you will see our projection for the next five years of capital investment at the operating companies. You will see us declining somewhat. Well, it's declining because Vogtle 3 and 4 will be winding up during this time period. And many of our major environmental programs will have had the major capital investments made through this time period. Point to emphasize here and I think Tom alluded to, but he didn\u2019t say it directly. The Clean Power Plan and compliance is not included in these numbers. These numbers are known environmental, or all compliance plans included, not the Clean Power Plan. Clean Power Plan could have some impact in the later years and even beyond of this capital investment. There is more detailed information material about the breakdown of the capital investment. Stan Connally : Well just speaking right up on the capital growth. Certainly, as you do that incremental capital growth, we're seeing modest growth in our rate base. And you can see over this time frame, 2.6% growth over the time period. And we hope to continue to execute on that. And as Mark said, it does not include any response to the Clean Power Plan. Now underpinning our ability to invest that capital must be a constructive regulatory environment. And we certainly all feel as though we have constructive regulatory environments in our four respective states. I\u2019ll pick-up quickly and just talk about the Gulf situation. I\u2019ll skip down the page a bit. Many of you know Gulf Power Company filed its 2016 rate-case about three weeks ago. It\u2019s using a forward-looking test year, using 2017 as that test year. And we would anticipate that we have an outcome on that in the spring or early summer of next year. At the same time, currently right now at Gulf, we have our annual clause filings that something we do every year. And certainly hope to have a constructive outcome there. We\u2019ve already talked about Kemper, a good bit. Anthony and the team are working very hard to ensure an outcome there that\u2019s constructive. And as well, they have annual filings they too will be going through over the next few months. They are PEP filing in their clause filings. Mark Crosswhite : For Alabama, Alabama has a right mechanism, called right stabilization and equalization, RSE. It\u2019s been in effect since 1982. It is a forward-looking test year process that we go through every year where we\u2019re making our filings to Alabama Power between now and December 1st, dealing with RSE and any clause filings that need to be made. Georgia, Paul has already talked about the Vogtle prudence case. So I won\u2019t go into that. We put on here 2019 rate-case and 2019 RSE. And what we want to convey there is we recognize that we\u2019re always subject to regulatory view and regulatory process. But we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon at Georgia Power in a substantial manner, between now and 2019. So, we think we have handled the major issue that Georgia Power is facing into that time. Okay, solid returns on investment. So you will see that over the past five years, we have had stable solid returns among the operating companies; predictable, sustainable reliable returns, as Tom would say. How do we continue that going forward? Well, first, we continue to focus on the fundamentals, customer service, reliability, safety, we\u2019re working in our communities. We also mitigate our O&M escalation. We rain-in inflation in our O&M costs. We are doing that through things now like alternate payment locations where we\u2019re putting payment locations and banks, grocery stores, pharmacies, where if the customer would like, they can go there and pay their bill rather than having to come into an office. Overtime, that is going to help us control our O&M costs. Executing there, will lead to constructive regulatory results, and will us to continue to earn solid sustainable returns going forward. Stan Connally : Okay, just to wrap up. Certainly, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the Southern value proposition, and we\u2019ll continue doing that through today. But a fundamental for us and for all of our team is staying focused on that customer value proposition, which is supported by those very fundamentals that Mark hit early on, service and reliability. We must stay focused there. We\u2019ve got significant accomplishments on our major projects. You\u2019ve heard, Paul talk about Vogtle, Tom talked about Kemper, both in the construction and regulatory arenas, made great progress there. And we anticipate even great progress going forward. Mark said it, we\u2019ve got visibility on our allowed returns over the near term, particularly at our two largest subsidiaries, Georgia Power and Alabama Power, over the near-term. That robust capital program is ongoing. I\u2019ll remind you it does not include our response to the Clean Power Plan. That creates the upside over the long-term. And then certainly all four of us are supremely focused on delivering those sustainable returns in support of that value proposition, going forward. So, with that, I think we're ready to transition to one of our teammates. Tom Fanning : Well, that wraps up our portion. There is a short change of plan. I think we're going to have a brief break. And here comes the break-master right here to tell us what we're going to do. Aaron Abramovitz : Yes, we're going to [Technical Difficulty] in the interest everybody's comfort and hunger and coffee. So, I want to keep on going. Well, let's take a quick 10 minute break. Just make it quick.  [BREAK] If everybody could take their seats, we will get started again. Okay, guys welcome back. Our next presenter is CEO of Southern Company Gas, Drew Evans. Drew Evans : Good morning. Thank you for returning. As Aaron said, my name is Drew Evans. I\u2019m the President Southern Company Gas. And for those you that I don\u2019t or haven\u2019t had the chance to meet, I\u2019ve been at AGL Resources, the predecessor of Southern Company Gas for 15years, and prior to that actually spent 10 years in the Southern system. So I\u2019m recycled Southern employee, and very glad to be back. My goal today is to orient you, maybe some of these for the first time on what Southern Company Gas is. And I think it would probably be to my advantage to give you a little bit of background or backdrop in terms of the construction of the natural gas business, in particular, not a lot of detail but just enough to be dangerous. The traditional natural gas business is simply broken down into three primary segments. We\u2019ve always talked about, obvious, the upstream, midstream and downstream. The upstream segment is the production segment, exploration production. And that probably has undergone the single largest change of anything in the energy industry. If you think about 2007 and 2008, natural gas prices were rising pretty drastically, traditional production was inshore, offshore, deepwater, and a relatively depleting resource. But we always say in the gas business, nothing saw the high prices like high prices. And in the 2008-2009 sort of shale revolution, a very significant, watershed changes has occurred that has significant implications for both the midstream segment and the downstream segments that we operate. I would tell you though that it is not simply just an issue of fracing, it\u2019s actually a trio of technologies between hydraulic fracturing, micro seismic, or 3D seismic, but also probably most importantly, directional drilling. And if you think about the footprint requirements of the exploration production business, they have decreased dramatically. And so the environmental impact of this activity is pretty significantly lessened. And it\u2019s also led to what we know today, which is to have today, which is probably 50 year or 100 years worth of reasonably priced natural gas supply. It had some other implications too though, because we\u2019ve typically thought about natural gas coming from production areas in the Gulf of Mexico, maybe Rockies, moving into the market areas of New England, and Mid-Atlantic. And because of the change in production to the Pennsylvania, Ohio areas, Marcellus and Utica shales, were going to see a change in how that natural gas is piped into markets. And so, hence our participation in pennies, Atlantic Coast, Dalton, and some of the other projects -- other three projects, which I\u2019ll show you today. It\u2019s also had a significant change from a customer perspective as well. And so, our customer bills are virtually half of what they were in 2008, which gives us a really nice opportunity to modernize the underlying infrastructure that\u2019s in ground for that distribution business. This is not a new set of things in terms of customer safety. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to accelerate some of those programs, so that we can use replacement of bare steel, cast iron, and what we would call vintage plastics that were installed, much of this pipelines are pre-2000 -- actually, pre-1983, 1990s. So today the business is that we operate, I won\u2019t talk about E&P, because we\u2019re not in the production business. We do view that has moved from exploration principally to production and become a manufacturing process. So we leave that for a different set of investors, sort of different set of operators. Our principal businesses were in the midstream and downstream segments. And in fact, our principal and core business is downstream delivery of natural gas to end-use customers. And I'll spend most of my time talking about that today. For those of you who remember the legacy AGL Resources, we are still the largest operator of distribution businesses in the United States. We serve 4.6 million customers. So, in context, that's probably one out of every 15-meters in the United States is now a Southern Company Gas customer. Our rate mechanisms will move largely to straight-fixed variable rate design, that's means a fixed cost recovery happens in the base charge and then natural gas as a pass-through. That's an interesting feature, an important feature from our perspective, because it means we have an incentive for conservation in our industry. And we talk much less about total retail sales to customers and more about number of connected customers, or modernization to the underlying infrastructure. And as I said, because we\u2019ve talked about lack of sales growth over two or three decades in the business, it was a very logical extension for regulators to move to straight fixed variable rate design. And if you think about the composition of our bill to a typical customer, depending on the geography, the fixed portion of that bill may only be 20% of what the customer is. And the fixed charge may represent only about the total charges to those customers, and still leaves with us with a pretty opportunity to invest in infrastructure without really material impact on our customer base. We operate in seven jurisdictions, the two largest certainly are Illinois and Georgia. We view all of our regulatory jurisdictions as being highly constructive, and we've enjoyed very good rate making-in very opportunity in each of our states. And we think what follows through is just a really nice sustainable period of capital investment. And we anticipate growing our rate base, almost doubling our rate base, in the next seven or eight years. And you can see the relative size of each of these in contribution. So, when we talk about the investment, we will invest somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 billion worth of CapEx in each of our -- in the totality of distribution companies over the next five to 10 years. About 80% of the capital deployment that we'll do over the rate of depreciation will occur in a rider-based program. These are not new concepts. And in fact I would tell you that Georgia has been a very progressive and constructive jurisdiction, in particular, enjoys this in our state as well. And their goal, 20 years ago, was to remove all of the bare steel and cast iron out of the Georgia system. These are 1950s-1960s technologies that are much more prone to leasing. So we've environmental and safety implications to having this type of pipe in our system. In Georgia, over a 12 year period, we were able to completely replace and remove all of the bare steel and cast iron. That happened in an year prior to gas prices being as low as they are today, and so very difficult lease for that state to take. We're now seeing though the same constructive mechanisms put in place in each of our jurisdictions. And I\u2019d point you in particular into Nicor Gas where we've got investing in Illinois, which is a very protective and productive project that will undergo from now until 2023 to remove in that jurisdiction, principally bare steel. Atlanta Gas Light will see multiple programs over the next decade or so where we\u2019ll remove vintage plastics, material called aldehyde A, which was put into the '70s that has embrittlement issues, and really deserves a more modern plastic in its place. And then in Elizabethtown Gas, we proposed a smart programs since our New Jersey jurisdiction we will remove the bare steel, principally cast iron in that jurisdiction, and that program could run through 2027. All of these programs are founded in customer's safety, certainly in modernization of the system. And we think the rider-based mechanism is the most constructive way to do it. We will have certain constructions in even some of these Elizabeth -- the smart program play is just proposed even some of these may have to move into a more normalized rate cycle. But today, this is probably the best way for modernization. These are not finite. I would tell you that of our 80,000 miles of pipeline that we operate today about 1,500 miles of that system are still bare steel and cast iron. We\u2019d like to see those generations of pipe remove first. But I would tell you that aldehyde A, the vintage plastics, represent about another 3,000 miles on top of that, and are just starting to get dealt within these programs, principally in Georgia. So, a significant amount of opportunity, we think for pretty descent duration. We\u2019ve entered into one of our first rate cases in a number of years, that\u2019s Elizabethtown Gas and so that\u2019s a filing that\u2019s outstanding. We\u2019re looking for $19 million rate increase there, related principally to pipeline that was put in service in that jurisdiction. We\u2019ve been very good about combating inflations in our business. And today, it still operate one of the most sufficient gas distribution to the United States. We measure in O&M per customer, and O&M per customer tends to be in the $150 to $175 per customer range. So very efficient across, if you look, across the utility industry. For LDCs, these are our core principal areas of focus; safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction. Just like in the power business is essential, having constructive regulatory relationships leads to constructive regulatory mechanisms. We\u2019re focused in all seven states in a constructive way. Our number one goal is to minimize the lag in capital deployment. And one of the things that we think we\u2019ll see is some maintenance of ROE in the 10% range over the long-term, so this is the LDC business in total. The second major segment that we operate today, and it's become a much larger segment, because of the inclusion of SONAT is the gas mid-stream business. And this includes both inner-state pipelines and underground gas storages. We find the pipeline tends to enjoy slightly higher ROEs. These are FERC regulated assets, and returns tend to be in 11% to 12% range. We\u2019ve focused our investments, principally in areas where we serve customers. And so if you think about SONAT, as Tom described it, between the two legacy companies, we represent more than half of the total transportation on the SONAT system in any given year. It makes sense for us to own and operate that system for the benefit of our customer base. As we re-pipe Marcellus and Utica shale gases into our other service territory, we\u2019re also going to embark on some constructions through partnerships. But these are all done on a demand driven basis. And so unlike some of the pipeline investments that you will see announced today, which are producer push, we\u2019re focused on areas where good portion of the demand, and in general, our ownerships reflect the amount of gas that we\u2019ll be shipping on that pipe for quite some time to come. And so we are doing three constructions today, Dalton has begun, has received, FERC certificate, and has begun construction. It's a movement of gas on the -- from the Transco system up into the northern portions of our distribution territory in Georgia, it allows us to access Marcellus gas as we see displacement down the Transco line. Atlantic Coast is the partnership with the number of large utilities moving gas into the Virginia area that construction will commence probably in the next year or so, and with commercial delivery sometime in 2019. It's much larger pipe and we are a 5% owner of it now along with the Dominion and Duke. PennEast is a pipeline that will serve it, our franchise is in the New Jersey area and it's a collection of really nice LDCs in that region principally New Jersey resources South Jersey industry and like, so again really focusing on demand pool rather than producer push investments. It\u2019s important to note that this slide does a 90% of that capacity is under contract with investment grade counterparties and so our intent is not to invest spectacle pipe construction, not to focus on producer push and really focus on full. We\u2019ve got a placeholder in here and certainly it\u2019s in our business plan, there are number of things that that can represent whether it\u2019s an expansion of the Sonat system or construction related to the Sonat system support to power generation interest of Southern. We do think that probably shale gas needs to play a larger role in supply in Illinois and southern of number of opportunities there where we might see some enhancements of systems or some minor constructions that would do it. So, a number of things we think that probably fit into this placeholder, but wanted to make sure we reserve capital appropriately to be some expansion. And then finally, we\u2019ve got a third segment which is gas marketing services and Tom alluded to this, and this also a downstream segment, its principal business is the delivery of natural gas to retail sale of natural gas. As many of you know Georgia at the system completely unbundled and separated distribution from the sale to customers in 1998, we\u2019ve been a major participant in that market and had garnered about 30% market share. As Tom said, it\u2019s been a competitive business over that 14 year or 15 year period, but we\u2019ve seen very stable earnings out of retail sales in Georgia. We\u2019re also selling gas in Illinois as well because of our participation there with the franchise with Nicor. That business was supplemented when we purchased Nicor in 2011 with the services business, that services business is a warranty services company that helps customers to makes better choices when they are having to make choices in their homes around their equipment and efficiency. And so both of these we think can be exploited pretty nicely within the Southern system in total and businesses that will focus on, but we say think the characteristic of this is much annuity like. Our growth is going to be driven largely by capital investment. There is no question about it, and this gives you a better sense of where the total deployment will be over the next five years at least. Our run-rate in the utilities will be about $1 billion a year. We think there is some persistency to that need, and as I said the vast majority of it is underwriter base programs. We\u2019ll also have the constructions for the three pipelines that we\u2019ve talked about Dalton, PennEast and Atlantic Coast. I think that brings the good set of diversity to that capital investment in total and those single project represents any concern for concentration, and we hope to find things in 2020, 2021 timeframe, that will supplement to that, and as I said that we\u2019ll likely see some larger expansion some of the pipeline replacements that were doing today. All of this leads to what we view is very stable predictable and diversified earnings growth. If you look at the compensation of our growth expectations and we do have very high expectations for growth, our range here is 8 to 10, Tom, I talk about 10 this morning certainly a growth rate that we are very comfortable about given the investments that we have to make, but no single piece of that growth shows concentration. Of the 54% will come out of distribution about some portion of that will be rate case related the vast majority of it is going to be rider based. Highly contracted mid-stream pipes are about a third of that total growth rate the. Biggest driver there will be the finalization of Atlantic Coast certainly PennEast and the completion of Dalton which will occur over the next 12 to 18 months. And then finally gas marketing services, we've seen 3% to 4% growth in that business over a 10 to 12 year time frame. We continue to have an expectation in that range here. We'll take questions at the end, but I think we'll let you with the highlights which is we represent a very interesting growth vehicle I think within Southern. Southern had interest in acquiring gas. I would say the Tom is one of the few executives who doesn\u2019t stand with those honest crop in front of the big cold pile. I think he has been very progressive and looking at the energy needs and demands of the customer base and we represent a very logical addition to that what is the powerhouse of Southern Company and I'm very-very pleased in front of the family again. So with that, I'll turn it over to Buzz Miller of Southern Power. Thank you. Buzz Miller : All right. Good morning. I am Buzz Miller, for those who don\u2019t know me and I'm very fortunate to be leading Southern Power right now. It's very exciting time for us. The first thing, I want to do is to take us through a little bit of history of Southern Power. A lot of this is just reemphasizing what Tom was saying in his opening presentation. After spin of merit in early 2000, Southern Power was established and it was established very simply as you see and you've heard. Lower risk, long-term contracts, credit worthy counterparties, minimal fuel risk transmission risk, and back in that time period gas was just emerging as a dominant solution, and our focus was on the super Southeast, and so that's why we did business for basically the first decade. New into that decade renewables were emerging as a dominant solution. Company took a hard look you have solar, you have wind and at that time our basis of looking at things was that utility scale solar was really a match for what I've just said for our business model. Ability to go and get long-term contracts, credit worthy counting parties and very and obviously the low fuel risk there on solar. Thinking that some day we would use it in the southeast the first projects were out west we have partnerships with Ted Turner's group at Cimarron. We've continued that partnership today. We've expanded to other partners as we got beyond that five year period. You can see in 2016, we had a huge amount of growth in the 2015 and 2016. We've expanding the solar partners we have. We've got that multiple going on now. We've gotten into wind now likewise we are with wind partners and expanding our list of partner that we work there, so we have a very diverse portfolio. Overall, now Southern Power has over 12,000 megawatts of capacity, still 75% of our portfolio is natural gas, but on an investment weighted basis, most of our investment is on the renewable side. But all of that is with strong contracts, strong counterparties. This slide emphasizes our contract coverage on average is about 17 years right now. For all of our portfolios, our investment weighted coverage for 10-year contract is greater than 90% and you can see the strength of our counter parties, as we continue to stick to what we said, we\u2019re going to do and execute our business. With the growing megawatts becomes realization that we are a large operating company and with more than 12,000 megawatts, it\u2019s important that we operate, maintenance our assets with the same excellent fashion, the retail business is done for years. And so we have a fantastic operating, Tom talked about gas fleet, Southern Power gas fleet is predominately GE. GE is best performing fleet I believe worldwide. We have a fabulous safety records. We have had zero reportable injuries at Southern Power in the past three years. And implementing the renewables our solar and wind are performing as expected as we evaluated. And I\u2019d say this will be a key going forward because we have to keep delivering on this for the energy margin as we go forward. And looking forward, you breakdown our business in the solar, wind, gas right now. Going forward, solar is going to be a little more difficult to do. The impacts of the market PPA prices are driving down. Solar panels are getting pretty much dumped across the market. So the combined, the low PPA prices we combined with our tax position; and solar right now is likely not going to be something we pursue a lot of. If there is project that meets out requirements or in investment, we would certainly do that. So we begin the pivot to win and Tom has talk a lot about. We expect that to continue. We did that in a big way this year. We\u2019ll continue with that going forward. We have a much more attractive financial profile for us the way PTCs play out. We\u2019re looking much likely did on the solar. We\u2019re working with wind developers, but also the turbine compliers to see what sort of strategic partnerships we can have. Now many of you know that on the wind side of things, there is a Safe Harbor provision so we can get the tax credits going forward. We\u2019re working with turbine suppliers now to make sure reposition ourselves going forward the best way possible on investment. And you know we invested in Mendota in Minnesota gas plant. As we move forward the next several years, acquisitions are likely what we\u2019re able to do on the gas side as clean power plants kicks in and we talk about as other environmental issues kick-in, maybe new build comes back into the equation but for right now with pipe gas acquisitions. The purpose for this slide really to combine our business model that we want credit worthy counterparties, we want long-term contract, and we\u2019re pivoting toward wind and gas acquisition you're pretty much directly to the center of the country and to the west. And that\u2019s where most of our business will be in the upcoming years. So what does this mean going forward for us? We mentioned, Tom, mentioned the huge growth in capital investments $4.4 billion this year, a point out -- a good chunk of that goes for projects that come in at the end of year and help us serve us in 2017 and beyond. But going forward to meet our growth requirements for income and to keep our credit metrics in line and all included, it's about a $1.5 billion we've targeted going forward to the next five years. And what that means to Southern Power net income, we're leveling out, you can see from '16 to '17 we're leveling out. I'll point out that in '16 a lot of that is ITC impacts on net income. As we go to '17, ITC impacts drop off drastically. And we stayed at leveled income profile and that is basically from operating our existing assets out there. We expect about a 12% cumulative growth rate for the next five years; in 2021 looking at about $500 million net income for Southern Power. Overall, our goal is to stay in that 10% to 15% range of Southern Company income and we think we can do that, we'll execute on that as I said. And with that, I'll turn it over to Art Beattie. Art Beattie : Thank you, Buzz. Good morning. I want to thank you all again for being here today. I know it's a bit of your time and I appreciate you listening to our story. I know it was probably 30 seconds after you either look at our materials online or actually picked up your book, you looked at my slides, you know everything I'm going to tell you but that's okay, it's going to be a little a anticlimactic for you. But that's the way it is. My job today is to try to mop up, make a story out of which you've heard today. I feel a little bit like the guy with the groom behind the bride pushing and making sure all of the loose ends are tied up. But you've heard Tom talk about this morning, the overarching strategy of Southern and how with our addition of Southern Gas with the Southern Natural Gas Pipeline and our success at Southern Power, the things that we're doing in our Electric Operating Companies and the even addition of PowerSecure are all going to lengthening and strengthening our earnings profile for the future and actually diversify our risk profile at the same time. He talked about greater than 95% of income in 2021, it's expecting to come from the state regulated electric and gas utilities and our long term contracted businesses. That's who Southern is. Our strides have not changed. We're still the same company we've always been, we're little broader, we're little deeper, but same story is going to help support our regular, predictable, sustainable earnings growth as we move into the future and we think that's what our plan reflects today. I'm going to start today with a review, a quick review of quarterly earnings. We reported this morning; as reported earnings of a $1.18 compared to a $1.05 in the third quarter of 2015, a pickup of $0.13 on an as reported basis; and year-to-date $2.39 against $2.30, a pickup of $0.09 on an as reported basis. If we exclude all the extraordinary items and we exclude the other items that actually get us to be consistent with what we guide to this year, we earned a $1.28 on the quarter versus a $1.17 last year, pickup at $0.11. We earn 2.64 on year-to-date basis compared to 2.45 a year ago, so we had an excellent quarter. And here that show one another drivers here, allow the drivers in the quarter were weather and other revenue affects at our traditional operating companies, Southern Power, a certainly a piece of that applies as well adding $0.08 year-over-year and then offset by financings to support that growth that we have incurred this year. As we normally do in the third quarter, we gave you guidance for the remainder of 2016 and our guidance is pretty simple. We expect to be at a very top-end of our range. And for those of you want to do the math, it's about $0.24 a share what we expect to earn in our fourth quarter, obviously excluding everything that listed at the bottom of that slide. When we build a plan, a financial at Southern and these are some of the financial objectives that we include, obviously our ultimate objective is to produce a superior risk adjusted return to shareholders. But we also pay attention to our financial integrity that\u2019s has taken the ground that we put. We look to be able to produce strong return on our invested capital in each of our company and we are obviously looking for regular, predictable, sustainable earnings and dividend growth over the timeframe. And I think that you will see our 2017 plan actually supports all of these elements as we move forward. Our plan certainly include a healthy level of CapEx, these are the summation of all the numbers that you heard by business unit this morning, it's about $25 billion dollars over three years and that $39 billion over five years. So that\u2019s majority of it going into the electric business basically new generation, transmission, distribution and in environmental projects. You heard Buzz talk about his investments in Southern Power begun half year going into a wind, gas and possibly more solar. You have heard Drew talk about the investments in Southern Gas and pipe replacement programs in the various restrictions. So, we got a very healthy capital budget that help to support the growth rate of our earnings overtime and I\u2019ll remind you again that none of this includes anything for power plant, there are no capital expenditures in their work so ever. Our financing program supports the capital program. We are going to raise about $10.5 billion of net financing over the next five years. You can see the slide there. We actually have a little bit of equity in there about a 1.5 billion of equity and about $9 billion of debt over that timeframe. Now as a remainder, we still have a little bit of equity to issue this year, we expect to issue another $550 million of equity to help support a contribution to Unidentified Company Representative pension plans to help our funding ratios in that regard. As our capital plans were changed, certainly will reflect that in our financing programs, but you can believe that we will pay attention to the same drivers around financial integrity as we do so. Our FFO to debt over the timeframe is greater than 16% so we feel very good about the support around the debt program and our financial integrity. What we have raised or expect to in the next five years actually payable and comparison that what we have actually done this year. By the end of this year Southern will have raised nearly $20 billion in both the debt and equity capital markets, it\u2019s been a fantastic year for us and even there is two sounds that lists some of the things. But I will call demand some of the diversity that we put in place utilization of green bonds and Georgia Power, Southern Power, leadership retail hybrids and we\u2019ve done all of this to create room for the $8.5 billion debt deal that we did in May of this year that help raised funds for the confirmation of the Southern Gas transaction. So, we\u2019ve had a great year. If we\u2019ve look to the amount of money that we\u2019ve raised so far this year in debt markets it\u2019s been almost $15 billion average rate 2.8%, average life of about 15 years. So it\u2019s been very low cost capital and that helps support the profile that we continue to have, Southern Company we talked earlier, $41 billion of debt outstanding average life of 16 years, average rate of 3.9%. That goes two things, certainly helps keeps customers rates low but it also help support our long-term strengthen and lengthen proposition around earnings. When we talk about earnings and earnings guidance, Tom mentioned that this morning, we\u2019ve always been very thumbs up about what we tell you based on the circumstances that we see, we didn\u2019t saw around bonus depreciation. We did so when we saw our capital program beginning to flatten out, we\u2019ve always been that way. And with that in mind, I\u2019ll take you back to the time we announced the AGL transaction. We basically stated that we would raise our growth rate from 3% to 4%, to 4% to 5%. And as we move into the 2017, as Tom has already intent to you we\u2019re going to raise our growth rate from 4% to 5% to 5% and that produces an earnings guidance range of 290 to 302 for the next year. And on the strength of everything that we have chatted about, we believe that we have a trajectory that supports a longer half way to growth around that 5%. Now certainly there will be variation around that 5%, but we think the 5% growth is what best describes our opportunity given the circumstances that we see in front of us. Our plan also includes something from the dividend perspective. When we announced the AGL transaction, we basically also stated that we thought that we could raise the annual increase in the dividend from $0.07 a year to $0.08 a year and our plan includes the actual increase in that dividend, even where the increase in the dividend rate our ability to cover that from a cash flow perspective has improved about 15% from the prior 15 years that we are seeing from 2002 to 2016, our cash flow covers dividend has increased by 15%. And also think it\u2019s important to remember that 95% of this dividend is covered by the businesses that we have described this morning, state regulated, electric and gas utilities and long-term contracted business models all go to support the dividend that we\u2019ll pay over the next five years. This particular slide helps to break a ground for you. The slides on the left actually are the contributions bad company with bad segment towards the 5% growth rate. But I also think it's important to remember at least on the right side of this. That the companies they were supporting their dividends are basically on the right side. This additional up codes will support basically two thirds of the dividend. While the other companies Southern Power, Southern Gas, and all of our companies, who will support the other one third of the dividend, 95% again supported by those definitions I mentioned earlier. So to sum it up, I think we've got a very strong and resilient plan. We've provided for increase in earnings growth we've provided for an increase of dividend growth, we paid very close attention to our financial integrities, we've given you a lengthened outlook rather than three years with not out five years, and we think from a risk perspective we're actually in very good shape which is diversified our jurisdictions. We've had recent success on our major projects. But we feel very good about where we are from a risk perspective but we think it's strongly supports our regular predictable sustainable business prospects for our investors and for waiting for a superior risk adjusted return for those investors. And with that, I will turn it back to Tom. Tom Fanning : Yes, it's really just the notion that we have added there we are now we've been exceedingly hyper active in 2016. We have added that hangs together from a logic standpoint but the strategy I think is clear this energy infrastructure business that we are in as you've heard. When you look at it and you go and got it makes sense transparent and if anything with improved growth we've reduced risk, we're moving forward. I think that business is terrific when you look at our business model there is very little kind of new big placeholders in order to achieve. We really do have this now there is risk around it, I admit it. But that business model works I'm very proud of it. Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith: For us just to kick it off on the Southern Power side the kind of rewind on the presentation a little bit. What kinds of ROEs, is there good rules down that we should be speaking about when you look at that capital plan and translating back to the earnings growth. Now, I know you guys provide its 12% earnings CAGR, you've provided, you can back into it, but I like to hear it from you guys I think about ROE or earnings? Tom Fanning : In round numbers you read about a 100 basis points onto it as compared to an integrative regulator return. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So to say, have you taken you that 12% earned ROE at the utility for instance? You would say 13%. Tom Fanning : That we are adding a 100 basis points. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, but it goes to 10. There is the slide in the appendix I believe behind above the slide. I think it gives you idea about contract length because whatever IRR might be it\u2019s going to see a function of contract length, how long it is. Longer term contracts we\u2019ll have lower IRRs and then shorter contracts will have higher IRR. Tom Fanning : Every project has a unique hurdle rate. So don\u2019t go and thinking that it\u2019s one number. I\u2019m giving you, for the portfolio, it\u2019s about 100 basis points ROE as compared to the traditional electric utility business. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And that\u2019s an ROE, not in IRR? Tom Fanning : Yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry. I'll stick with the same subject. Looking at the year-over-year puts and takes, 2016, 2017, onwards, given the roll off in the solar ITCs, I know we've talked about it before, where do we stand today in terms of that ITC roll off 2016, 2017 and how do we think about the earnings contributions? Is that a good flatline number in 2017 going forward in terms of ITCs? Tom Fanning : Just what Buzz showed you? It would be somewhere. We think Southern Power is going to be what somewhere between 300 million, $330 million? Where\u2019d Buzz go? And remember what we told you at other earnings call. When we show this enormous growth and \u201916 CapEx is 4.4 billion, a big number. We said a lot of dedicated to \u201917, that\u2019s what just seeing. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t have the dividend anymore. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, so just said differently, definitely good stable flat line number offer which to grow, there is not really? Tom Fanning : And in fact when you look at the growth of Southern Power and we expected the 1.5 billion deployment every year, it\u2019s a nice ratable increase. We work very hard to make this thing in the fashion that we building our business model. In fact, both our businesses are. Southern Gas is the same way. If you really want to think about caveman kind of math, you\u2019ve got a slug of capital at the growth business there and a slug of capital at the growth business there and that\u2019s the way it works. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. One last higher level question for you. As you think about, you kind of effectively narrowed your growth range to the top-end. How do you think about the risk reduction of the business profile in tandem with that? So the question that comes to my mind is I suppose you\u2019ve got some wood to chop in Mississippi for instance next year et cetera. How do you think about all the very straight that go into that to narrow the range ultimately? Tom Fanning : So right now, Anthony Wilson, where are you? Anthony right there, CEO of Mississippi Power. He can talk to you a little bit. We have already started some conversations. Remember, our relationship with virtually everybody we touches kind of real not discrete is continues. So we\u2019ve already started, so I don\u2019t want to front run a lot of stuff, but I would argue that this plan, I almost liken it to women\u2019s gymnastics and the balance beam. It\u2019s kind of hard to not this plan also balancing. I think this plan is robust to reasonable outcomes. Let\u2019s get Greg and then, Ali, we will come to you. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on that and then second question. So at a high level was increasing competition for these types of lower risk long-term contracted types of deals, right? You\u2019re in that business now. Dominion\u2019s there. Duke\u2019s there. Con Ed\u2019s there. NextEra has been there for years. So what competitive advantage are you bringing to the table that\u2019s you\u2019re able to execute these deals add hurdle rates look competitive when we hear anecdotal evidence all the time that the equity IRRs on these things are getting compressed pretty fast? Tom Fanning : Well, it\u2019s simple. Because the best example I'm going to use is first Solar. When we think about us starting -- I think I've just done Fleischmann [ph] about this. Even when we started solar, we were actually very careful, we were almost pedantic sometimes. We don't rush and do fast and all that stuff. When we started on the solar effort, we started in conjunction with Ted Turner and we started developing relationship all over. We held Internal Solar Summit and we studied, and we studied and finally when we saw execution start to occur in the kind of vein that we enjoy, we started to move quickly and at scale. We developed relationship with First Solar where not only did we have kind of the relationship where they would develop and we would step in the operation, we also worked with them steadily on improving their development of power sales contracts in permitting and transmission. And so, we actually coached up worked with the folks that we developed and developed significant relationships. And First Solar has borne through for us and there is others. We're doing the same with Wind right now. If you have the advantage of having scale and of having an intimate understanding as to what it takes to step into a deal, the developers are going to be much successful, much more efficient and effective in what they do. We believe developing those relationships is where I started the slide that does matter, this is not a company run by a spreadsheet. You can't do that business with spreadsheet. You're going to hand up with a million different contracts with no ideas to how to administer them. We believe in risk management before we step into the contract and we think that : who are your big kind of wind guys going forward? Where are the big relationships you're working on? Drew Evans : So, we started with the Apex end the last year we've done another deal with them. NV Energy we just announced deal with and we have another wind partnered that we haven\u2019t announced yet, but before the end of the year couple of more wind projects with another partner. Tom Fanning : Point there is we're not everything that everybody especially we go scale, we go to people that we can repeat the business model particularly focused on the quality of the power sales contracts in permitting. Unidentified Analyst : My second question switching gears just to Mississippi Power in Kemper, so you said that you're optimistic, you'll be moving to commercial operation there, can you tell us what the discreet steps are from here to there and then when you file the rate case next year, can you just explain us what do you -- what you're base line assumption is in terms of outcomes, it's a little bit complex, because you've wholesale rate base, retail rate base, stuff that was back to you -- can you comment on that? Tom Fanning : Let me give you the steps, in terms of -- I don't want to front run any rate case, we're going to file a rate case that when we'll file it, we'll describe it to you. Before we thought I really don't want to go there Craig [ph]. And what they've said so, they're really pretty clear, our estimate as we disclosed, our best estimate of COD and service as the end of November, we're producing electricity out of A; B comes online. We think we've learned a lot and A we'll move B through the add to gas clean up system, deliver syngas to the turbines. The turbines are actually running great on syngas and they actually blended it, we've run at 100% syngas, we do now all sorts of testing right now, so it's really going well. Our best belief is November 30th, I mean they can slide a week or two or whatever but the unknown is unknown as what we've always said to you. Assuming everything works our best gas at November 30th. Close on, we'll file essentially in accounting order that will us to defer cost from COD to final rates in place. It will defer cost and essentially create and accounting, we will do that with a commission. And then we want to demonstrate unlike some other kind of circumstances, we actually want to demonstrate performance on these units. So that when we do file and when we finally get an outcome, we can show that this thing works, used and useful. I think it's really important and I think we are going to be able to demonstrate that. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Tom Fanning : That's about all I want to go into. I don\u2019t want to firm on rate case but whoever. Ali Agha : Ali Agha of SunTrust. Tom, two questions, first, when I look at your CapEx forecast for 2021, it comes down in the last few years, is it fair to say that the 5% EPS growth rate kind of follows that packing so it's more front end load and then slows down in the last couple of years? Tom Fanning : It's really pretty way below overtime and that\u2019s what gives us great confidence about this. It's about 5% growth rate all the way through. Ali Agha : Okay. Tom Fanning : And here it's interesting about that growth rate when you look at that CapEx recall, whenever I just say about that are flattening EPS growth rate there was the debit I talked about all that\u2019s gone, we have eliminated the debits, we have lose the curve off by investing in a growth business in gas and growth business in Southern Power, we have an newly especially in Sonat and we have growth opportunities on top of that. Anything material beyond what we are saying is in this plan and that was low response to the clean power plant at there. That\u2019s amazing stuff. No kind of big assessment on some brand new environmental regulation which could occur depending on what administration comes in. We have got Southern Power at 1.5 billion. We just did a 4.5 billion. I actually feel good about where we are and would incorporate the slowing growth factor the CapEx is anything other than the absence of the response between power plant wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all and in the future 2021, who know that we have a cleaning power plant and that was going to have to start adding from gas particularly in response of that. But it's not in the plan. Ali Agha : Okay. And my second question 2016 was a very active year for you in terms of acquisitions. As you plan your outlook through 2021, our acquisitions contemplated, you look at the state of the industry, you expect more consolidation, is Southern a player or are you distinct out of that and just executing on your current portfolio? Tom Fanning : Yes, you know I have answered the M&A question, things like for 100 years and the M&A question remains the same, what fundament of this plan is it doesn\u2019t depend on anything like that. And so as we have said before we are big easier shop and then order for us to do any sort of acquisition is got to make sense from cost of capital and return on capital. This plan doesn\u2019t need anything new now, we have suggested around the Sonat acquisition and our specific assets that we are considering we will see how that goes, we haven't really talked about that much ourselves. But that\u2019s not an enormous big deal at least a size that we think is easily adjust and if it doesn\u2019t happens we are still okay. In terms of other new deals, I think all we have done when you look at that asset, we created optionality. We are no more or less interested in M&A than we were before. And when you think about 2016 it looks like that there was a flurry of activity, it\u2019s just so happen the opportunities arriving and down there they were. The one little bit of quick mover was AGL, the pipeline we\u2019ve been talking about for about two years, and really it was interesting we could have continued on that course, but when AGL happen that gave us even a better set of cards in which to deal with pipeline transactions because now we move from the third or fourth largest consumer natural gas, now to the most important natural gas company in the United States I think. Now, PowerSecure is another one, in this PowerSecure again was not material in my sense excepted with strategically was important because when we started again looking at these kind of slowing and flagging sales of electricity, we can either just let it happen or try and play it off it. And I swear to you, I think our business model will make perfect sense on the customer premises, the customer don\u2019t want to get involve in our business we think there is terrific capital deployment opportunity by marrying with these guys is, with customer reach oh and by the way when we did AGL natural set of company gas we doubled our customer reach. So, now we\u2019re 4.5 million to 9 million. And they procure natural gas. You know what balloon uses natural gas and so have Southern Power, you have synergy with gas and then you have the reputation of financial and integrity of Southern Company. And channel count reach, there is tremendous synergies potential. Southern PowerSecure is no big right now, but it is a terrific valuable option. Yes, Andy. Andy Levi : Hi, good morning. It's Andy Levi from Avon Capital. Just on the gas side, the 8% to 10% growth rate that you put out there and that\u2019s earnings per share or net income or income? We just break that down a little bit like for Sonat kind of where the starting point is on net income and how much that could grow on an annual basis. And then for AGL, does that growth rate of net income also include cost synergies from Georgia operations in just general in that 8% to 10% growth? Tom Fanning : Let me hit the simple. Andy Levi : I want to double count the cost savings. Tom Fanning : Remember I describe Sonat as an annuity, what it looks like. But remember I said it\u2019s an annuity that has an option for future growth that\u2019s how I alluded to Sonat. So, most of the otherwise intrinsic growth is coming out of safety related pipeline replacement program. Drew Evans : Yes. Andy it\u2019s like -- it\u2019s all in there, okay. So, to the degree that they get any cost savings from the merger that they could fall between Georgia Power and really Georgia, AGL and Southern Gas enjoys it. That\u2019s only the opportunity is where we have any overlap. Two degree Georgia Power yes those savings are Southern Gas gets those savings those get reflected in those numbers. I can give you any specific number there because we\u2019re still under process or determining what those could be. Andy Levi : And can you talk about the level of cost savings on even it's kind of a broad level how much should we kind of incorporated over the next two years to three years. And then Sonat what is the starting point of that income? Drew Evans : I\u2019m sorry. Andy Levi : For Sonat what is the starting point of net income? Drew Evans : So, I think either Mark Lantrip or -- can talk more ratably about potential savings here or even Ron himself. Mark Lantrip : So, the savings that we expect to get from the merger for AGL are baked into the numbers now were midway I would say we're about third way through the integration process and so we will go run it will run through 2018 we're just now beginning to work for some integration issues around the systems we are integrating as much as we can operationally realize this is gas company not a electric company so you don\u2019t have the same benefit but you would have by bringing in the same kind of operational characteristics but they are some in Georgia and we are going through holiday and lows right now and figuring out how to do those things better and we will enjoying. And there is really to variable to synergies one is just as straight over old related synergy and Mark those are going as expected or we did better. The second is top line synergies and those are going a little bit better and I think about bloom and other things. I don\u2019t remember the number on that so it sounds about that. Art Beattie : Little less than that. Unidentified Analyst : [Indiscernible] Mark Lantrip : Yes, that's right I mean most of the synergies for AGL and Southern it will be on a shared services really and things like IT, some HR, some of accounting beyond there. There will be some small synergies in the Georgia territories. Michael Lapides : All right, Tom. Thank you for taking the question and hosting the day. Michael Lapides with Goldman here. You've given pretty robust net income guidance for Southern Power and Southern Gas. Just kind of back of the on blow map when implied given your 5% overall in EPS growth pretty low growth that the electric utility. Can you just talk about how you expect EPS growth and rate base growth at the electric subsidiaries? What you're formally expecting proposed as a percentage growth. Do you think rate base growth and EPS growth moved up more step with each other or there are any differentiation there, and if so what? Mark Lantrip : Rate base growth I believe is certainly going to be lower obviously. We are going to quit adding the year ago complete the global projects by 19 and 20 so the curve on that goes down the other items in the budget would be normal transmission distribution maintenance project improvements for customer service around that. The additional environmental projects most of that related to ash pond, it's included in there some of those are still preliminary in terms of their estimate so it reflects what we know today in terms of those dollars. But those could move around a bit but that's really where there growth rate is coming from in the electric outflows. What they are trying to do is to offset that capital program they put in place in electric operating companies to mitigate that would cost and flows so that they can hold the price down to customers at a reasonable level at or below inflation. Tom Fanning : But it is pretty clear the operating headers are going at much slower rate and math is really pretty simple if you backend in the manner they are going slower now what is excellent is this response to the clean power plant Clean Power Plan. Pretty clear to me that the generation portfolio of America will change and we\u2019ll just see how that goes, don\u2019t want to front run how that\u2019s going to happen certainly not in front of this political season. But there again, if you start seeing things like cash generation showing up in the 20s at this place otherwise either eroding or slow growing base load or CTs necessary to meet intermittency, it appears to me gas is going to have to grow. That\u2019s not in the plan. Paul Patterson : Paul Patterson, I wanted to ask you about Kemper. One of the commissioners in Mississippi is asking whether it might dispatch or not production costs look like they are higher and what have you. Can you give us a flavor for what you think the production cost, just pure production costs for saving gas will be? And then number two, you mentioned I think a demonstration for used and useful. It seems like there\u2019s substantial ramp, when should we think about that what your plan in terms of being able to show that it is used and useful? What time I guess, time period? Tom Fanning : Look, I think as we move through the start-up process, as we not over dominate normally expected to start-up process, we think it moves beautifully. Like for example when A went through the asset gas cleanout system, remember that was one of the big issue went through it right away, went through it first time. Look, I think we\u2019re going to be able to demonstrate using useful very easily. This plant is going to work, it is working. And so now we get B on and we integrate. Remember what we always said the first things hasn\u2019t been as much as an issue, we\u2019re only talk this is years ago and how one of the big risk with enormous plan was the integration of a whole lot of different systems. Now we were combined segment three different systems, this one has something like \u201914. So they\u2019re being integrated, actually that\u2019s going very well expected. I think the used and useful collection is going to be demonstrated in between DOD and when we file the rate case and actually through the rate case. It will continue to improve it performance, I think pretty dramatically over the year, we\u2019ll be able to demonstrate that this during that time frame. I think we\u2019ll be able to demonstrate that, I think we follow data around availability and other things. Kim could tell you more about that. But if you want, you look at the file and we just made an informational filing, Anthony here a couple weeks ago, we\u2019ll be able to demonstrate. Now with respect to the energy, the energy is variable and it depends on whole host of factors included in the off take of what is CO2 valued at, remember that valued at index of the price of oil. And I think in the past and other earnings call, I don\u2019t see any reason why this is change. But at 100 bucks of barrel, I think this thing was ordered, I think we produced energy in the low $1, $1.25 something like that. With oil at around 50 bucks, I seem to remember was about 260, 270 per million BTU. Now natural gas, so here the other thing, the energy that comes off of Kemper is going to be much more stable. It\u2019s not going to be as volatile as natural gas. We are already seeing natural gas pop up. What\u2019s the latest? So you tell me, there is the host of factors selling forward. Steve Fleishman : Hi Tom, Steve Fleishman, Just one question, I guess just following on the Kemper who has couple of reports, updates and has something about improvement projects that you'd like to do, could you talk a little about what those are? Tom Fanning : Sure, engineer thing engineers. There's really kind of two things. Along the vein and in fact a lot of, a lot of, many of the cost increases we've had along the way through construction which improved on the original design. Or I would say put a valve here or I would say had another duplicative system over here. So, along the way we had added to the process. They've identified things right now that we believe we will add even after COD and before filing or even into the next year. It's just different things and really the idea is kind of two fold, one is to improve the immediate performance of the plant, really going to Paul's question, that goes to what would be the availability out of the box and how can we perform it? And the second point really goes to a sustainable question. Whenever you have a prop for example we tripped the gas turbine over the weekend, well it wasn't because it wasn't running well, and since here we're going through a bunch of regime of tests, that we switched between -- remember this could be a dual field plan, and we switched between syngas and natural gas, blah, blah, blah, blah, and when we switched to natural gas, it trips some logic and the computer code, okay, so we take it down, fix it and improve it. Other things we can do along the way that less than the frequency of those kinds of events. That's what we're talking about. Steve Fleishman : And then I guess is there any kind of scale size of those or it is just to be\u2026. Tom Fanning : Haven't disclosed them, but I wouldn't now. Art Beattie : we have not put any numbers add on that Steve, we're still evaluating what those could be and certainly it has to go towards operational improvement of the plan, safety of the plan, those are the priorities that we're putting forward at this time. Steve Fleishman : [Indiscernible] Art Beattie : I'm not going to comment. Tom Fanning : We have included we think reasonable estimates around all these things in our plant and we think our plan is robust to any reasonable outcome that we can see. Steve Fleishman : And then just one following up question on the Southern Power kind of part of the investment plan, so with a 1.5 billion a year, just can you give us -- I think you said Tom that you think it's a conservative number and it could be a lot higher but it's really hard to know what that number is going to be so maybe just a little more color on how we should think about that number being reasonable number over the period? Tom Fanning : I think it's a reasonable number. The ebbs and flows around that number, the pluses and minuses. So, in the last two years, we did 2.5 billion and 4.5 billion round numbers and now we're going to down to 1.5 billion, well. Could we do more? Sure. It kind of goes to some of the other questions people raised and that is, what is the IRR that's available out there? Under what conditions can you do it? Will there be opportunities, bigger than a 1.5 billion? Sure. Which ones do we want to do? We're in a carry forward position on tax credits, that's no secret. And so we always have to assess our IRRs for any project based on the time weighted value of cash flow. We think the best estimate we have right now is a 1.5 billion per year going forward. And that's what we've got in the model. If there's something upside to that, yes, potentially we'll see. Are there downsides to that? Sure. But that's what we think is a right number. Jim von Riesemann : Tom, Jim von Riesemann from Mizuho. Can you talk a little bit about your thinking around ESCOs and how that business model has evolved from the late '90s, early 2000s to today, energy service companies? Tom Fanning : Yes. Okay. Okay now what makes sure what kind of things start there. Jim von Riesemann : PowerSecure what's different today versus back in the late 90s early? Tom Fanning : Absolutely, okay this is not the -- we are do about this a little bit. Who was it somebody in summer we got to recapture the word service, okay. But when we take it my having had the scarves of the SO energy services business that is not what we are doing. Now PowerSecure provides terrific service to customers, all right. I am down plating services but these are not split to say is deal. This is not some crazy variable boy I hope it works kind of same. This is return on and return of capital we covered over the life of the contract with minimal to know few risk. It's not the old ESCOs of the 80s, and 90s, okay, not what it is. This is a program that we are putting place that will replicate what we are doing in Southern Power, it is energy infrastructure in this case it is distributed energy infrastructure. Unidentified Analyst : Where is the IP? Sidney Hinton : We own the IP this infrastructure that we are doing today is we are not assimilating other people solutions and driving out some alternative financing package. We only happy around that these are our solutions reengineered gone out long this Fortune 500 accounts with, so we are really in rich position to bring value to the table. Tom Fanning : Sidney, give us just a quick dimensioning of how many Fortune whatever, whatever, whatever\u2026 Sidney Hinton : We are five of the top 25 Fortune 500 accounts and that may not sound impressive because we have had no balance sheet. So we had to have a lot of happy, where in the just as accounting -- when Southern Company instantly solve that issue first, we sort of eight of the top 25 a grocery change and again goes back, as a counterparty we want to get credit for us. But very, very rich in IP and that's how we won so many large accounts. So the top data centers, it's should be stunning, we're not allowed to disclose, we'll be stunning the number one they were in with. Tom Fanning : And I know we are talking a lot of that that show it's a strategic option, this is now a big player right now in Southern Company's earnings. But we think with the way of technology is revolving, we think the way customers behaving, energy infrastructure on their premises we think maybe particularly important, this is our small bid, our options on playing more and more offset otherwise low sale. Mike Weinstein : Thanks Tom. Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. While back to Georgia regulators had always expressed interest in new nuclear beyond [indiscernible], I am just wondering in light of the settlement they came out, how was that settlement shifted or how is it shifted, what's the new thinking now on following new peer? Tom Fanning : I think the answer to that question really centers on what untimely come down from congress with respect to any sort of price or cost of carbon implied into the nation's future generation portfolio. If you believe there will be a price or cost of carbon implied in the United States, nuclear immediately becomes really important I mean really important, because all of that said total starts to erode faster. Gas has a really important place, but it has a little bit of feeling. You are going to have build new in the future, now is it in the 20, probably in the 30s and beyond. As an option to becomes really important, but I think you\u2019re talking probably in the third. Did I get your question? Mike Weinstein : Regulators in Georgia, as a result of segment process to be indicated or thinking at all. Tom Fanning : I don\u2019t think, so I think, the State of Georgia has been terrific through this whole process. Really I have Obama Administration and Congress for haven\u2019t say. Department of energy have our new that Ernie Moniz who is the best Energy Statutory we\u2019ve ever had. They have been resolute in supporting Vogtle through with construction and I think we\u2019ll continue to have a good showing there. I think whether it is Clinton or Trump going forward, you will still see support out of the administration, America needs nuclear they all stop. Now, we have terrific track record to talk about on Vogtle 3 and 4 the fact that number one, we've settled the litigation. We\u2019ve improved the performance of the contractors on the site and now we have pending commission approval, a resolution on prudence at Vogtle, terrific positive stuff. All that does is solidify, what has always been a constructed posture by the state, the commission, the governor, the general assembly anything else in Georgia. Does that change their view on the future? No. Art Beattie : The one thing on the question, go back to that. Through this integrated resource plan, they've preserved to option at Stuart County, allowing us to collect $99 million over the next three to five years and perfecting that option. So, they have preserve given an outcome that happens on see clean power plant and/or calls to carbon. I preserve that option for State of Georgia. Tom Fanning : Yes. All it did is it just made it more real. You got here. Let\u2019s get some as ask question first. Paul Debbas : Paul Debbas from Value Line. How much re-contracting risk is there a Southern Power and what happens if you get to the point, where you can renew or extent the contract? Tom Fanning : Well, the data point, we try to use to eliminate that question, we watch that right hawk -- is this notion of 90% of our capacity is covered over, it was about 10 years. So that\u2019s how much re-contracting risk there is. We believe the contract that are expiring our largely gas higher contract. So we think there will be a market there. The variance with respect to this plan is not significant. Just make sure, I got you too guys, anyone else, so I just want to other folk\u2019s person. Unidentified Analyst : Tom, this is a follow up on that. Are your Southern Power plants fully paid for by the time initial contract rose up. Tom Fanning : I\u2019m sorry. Unidentified Analyst : Are your Southern Power plants fully paid for by the time the first contract goes up or do you relay on some other contractor? Unidentified Company Representative : I would say the significant amount of the original investment is paid off or PPA period conditional but this fully paid off here some level of free cash flow, it goes back to pay that investment maybe the renewal asset a lot of that. Tom Fanning : Renewal is a really reach cash flow going forward. Unidentified Analyst : You\u2019ve initially Vogtle will be going to be 12% rate increase, now it\u2019s 6 to 7, where is the delta there that\u2019s kind of time decide just interest rates? Tom Fanning : Sure, we disclose, it's actually a number of things, production tax credits, we are giving a full allocation before it was going to be split up. We've got loan guarantees that weren\u2019t assured and actually our performance on the loan guarantees has been much better than we expected. There were significant parts of the first contract if you remember when we first entered into this contract there was some expectation of inflation and in fact some expectations may have been in excess of 4% to 5% as inflation did not show its head, as measured by certainly index, it defused us both between the contractor and Georgia Power to fit. What was otherwise a variable index and so we fix them to our advantage. That's what the delta is. Unidentified Analyst : My question is on ratings, do you know how long would you forgive you to covere as a negative outlook and also see operating targets for the whole co and Southern Company Gas? Tom Fanning : I didn\u2019t hear your question. Can you ask again? Unidentified Analyst : How long it will take or how long will you get you through the get rid of the negative outlook? Tom Fanning : I'm sorry I'm absolutely not understanding you. Unidentified Analyst : Alright, what's the negative outlook on reduce. Tom Fanning : The negative outlook I think you want to ask. I don\u2019t know we need to work with that. Unidentified Company Representative : Well, we've always been founds up of those gas and retailers and everything which is going on and every new transaction that we go through we've hopped all the agencies about it and so we are in constant communication about what our strategies are and where we are going so again it's up to them to evaluate that we're certainly pushing to get the changes put in place but that's certainly up to them. We think fundamentally over the past year our risk posture has changed for the better. For the questions I might go please repeat to them in it. I'll go Julien, then Andy and then Mike here we go. Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just going back to Mike's question from before a little bit on Georgia. SCANA opted to pursue a new tax election recently why not follows to given that it seems like it reduces burden of the backend? And then separately and probably more importantly Fleur [ph] talked about our hiring ramp broadly. Should we expect the update going aforementioned of the schedules at a certain point in time again this is more of a procedural kind of issue? Tom Fanning : So the 174 is a really an excess thing while let me hit that one first it is the 174 tax deduction. You are we've been very clear about our belief that Camper County is absolutely eligible for the deductions. And so that's where our primary focused has to the extent SCANA is successful on making that claim we certainly will follow through on global but we believe I'm not going to comment on summer that's their business. We absolutely believe that the structure of those research and experimental tax deductions are certainly suitable for Kemper and that is where we have focused. Steve, do you want to hit the schedule or Paul or either one of you? Steve Kuczynski : I think comments with regard to schedule, there is always ongoing evaluation of the schedule we don\u2019t not anticipate any changes any way, but certainly there will be variations on some milestones between here and there and it\u2019s normal part of construction? Tom Fanning : There you talk a little bit about the learning curve, the benefits of going 2, 3 and then 4, the placement we just made. Steve Kuczynski : So just to give an anecdote on what\u2019s been realize as you go from what is for the next our largest module CA20 which was set few years back and unit three, I think is about 16 hours or so from lift to actually sets and it took 58 minutes do it on unit four. And it\u2019s just remarkable improvements just in quality and doing things in second time and so we\u2019re trying to leverage that and pretty much everything that we go do, so unit four is actually staffed with less people and getting higher productivity based on that. Tom Fanning : And then one more comment on balance of the plant. Steve Kuczynski : Yes, balance of the plan is going very, very well. So cooling towers are in, turbine building is going to start to show to be close here soon, all the structures stills in and focused just remains on Nuclear Island but feel really good about the progress. But particularly the learnings that we see from three to four and SCANA sees the same learnings. Tom Fanning : You made a comment about ramping up. We have already got a thousand people more this year at Vogtle 3 and 4, so that ramping up already occurred for us. Unidentified Analyst : One quick, a little detail on the ROE from the Southern Power piece, if I look just the guidance, I need 10% and 12% net income or what have you about 40 million a year growth rate top of the range 12%. If I think about 1.5 billion if we\u2019re talking about, is it right to assume about a 40% equity layer there because when I trying you that math, it comes out somewhat less than a 13% ROE. That is why I\u2019m trying to get at is it IRR or an ROE that we are getting like a 6% to 7% number? Tom Fanning : Bill, do want to go after that. I think it just some of the tax impacts that impact Southern Power specifically. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. Okay. I think actually a question for earlier. We are talking about an average ROE overtime exceeding the retail businesses. I tend to think about that really an hour, a couple of two hour. Both return in any given year of the business, it\u2019s going to be a function of the types of capacity technology and so on. That premium over retail isn\u2019t overtime return, I average already in time in IRR. So I think the front in the new investments maybe we\u2019ll less than that, let me greater that later on and that\u2019s give us some mixture of the project technology to bring added. So that\u2019s the quick answer why your math has come in a little bit les. Unidentified Company Representative : From a leverage perspective 40% is a good number use still. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. I mean, we\u2019re not levering up Southern Power to achieve a result if that is the question. Andy? Andy Levi : Andy Levi from Avon Capital. Just a few financial questions, so Southern Power is growing 8% to 12%, I know 12% a year, excuse me. The gas companies are growing 8% to 10% a year. But I don\u2019t see for the core utility, electric utility, how much should that be growing here? Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, there is on slide in my group where due to the percentage of the 5% that those range, those concentric ranges. So you can back into it that way. I believe what you're seeing the net income growth over that timeframe would be just a bit above 2%. Andy Levi : And then on the financing plan, I see, I guess that'll be [indiscernible] lease up equity that's you're going to put out there, what is the target equity ratio at Southern Company that you're targeting? Unidentified Company Representative : Well right now we're in the mid-30s and by the '21 timeframe it'll creep up a bit little taller between 35 and 40. Andy Levi : And at Southern Company. Unidentified Company Representative : Southern Company. Michael Lapides : Michael Lapides with Goldman. Two questions, one are we seeing a structural shift in the ability to build significant gas pipelines from this country for nimbi regions, good old fashioned Nimbi citing, permeating etc. what do we do about that and how do you manage through that as you think about Southern Company gas growth rate? That's first kind of question although it probably has subsets. The other one is the one place we don't really see Southern involved is in independent electric transmission outside of the traditional operating companies, can you just talk about that business in general. Tom Fanning : Two very interesting questions. And you know what, I would -- let's differentiate pipe. Look, we make it our business especially since I've been in this role to engage constructively with the environmental community. So I'm talking about Sierra Club and NRDC, and ADF, Union of Concerned Scientists and States and everybody else. They have had an important voice and how America is thinking about evolving its generation fleet. And I think we've had very constructive conversations. And I think listening to them is important because I think that does help drive a lot of positivity that comes out of the administration, certainly depending on who wins and all that. So, it's kind of important to not only use our own lands but look to the lands of others and how that may impact where this future is going because it certainly has had an effect on coal. It has an effect I think on gas going forward in a more important way. But I think it is irrefutable that we need gas today more importantly as coal wind down and it's hard to build nuclear and we add more intermittent resources in form of renewable. I'd make that point. So, from the challenge of building pipes, I want to break that into two different ideas, one is pipes required to support what I think will be the natural evolution of the generation fleet of America is going to be easier to do, then pipes required to export gas through LNG facilities. So, totally different ballgame I think on part of the environmentalist community because at one hand pipes require to build new gas plant that will enhance the retirement of coal or sub plant what is otherwise a slow growing nuclear fleet America or perhaps the case of some other companies, that are disappearing nuclear fleet, they're going to need more pipes. We can't do it all with energy efficiency in just renewable. So, we're going to need those pipes in order to handle this transition, very clear. The question on pipes for export, totally different question, So as it's a terrific question and may we have been very -- we try to be very thoughtful about that, I mean when go this believe you should think about as our believe are grounded this is one of the believe that we didn\u2019t showed you. But there is a difference between price of export price to require to enhance transition of the fleet. Did I hit that one for you? Andy Levi : Yes. Tom Fanning : The other question was? Andy Levi : Independent electric transmission, just it's a one thing we don\u2019t see Southern Company. Unidentified Company Representative : So here is the -- and I think there is a generally well-known I am going to stay away from anything confidential, but you must know that there are lots of win deals particularly, one of the challenge of the win, I said this before is that when requires -- when this best located where they are few people and therefore you need to move the win resource necessary to where the load centers are, okay. Solar not like that so we can wave where the people are, generally speaking. When we think about there are lots of potential deals in the United States that depend on long haul contracted transmission systems in order to comfort the development of big scale win resources the United States. If there was a contract or transmission which gave us our degree of certainty when we think about merchant's model, Southern Company does not like the merchant model. But if there was a long term contract that supported the development of transmission that probably goes hand-in-hand with the development of large scale win resources, yes we would be open to that. But it's a chicken and the egg thing. So this is very difficult business, number one in order to develop long halt contracted transmission, not merchant transmission contracted transmission you got to make sure your line up at the same time, this big scale that you need big scale win in order to justify building a transmission line. You need a lineup that win resources would a thing for the energy and when you need to be able to handle all other different state issues that you tried to build that transmission lock. Are we open to it, sure, it would happen to built consistent where our business model. Okay. There are lots of proposals out there and we talk all the time, hard to do with deal though. Unidentified Analyst : I will just throw this one out there so if Trump does win, any thoughts on kind of energy policy aspects anything that would matter to you guys? Tom Fanning : Well, listen we have made it point to be involved in both campaigns in terms of just breathing them on what we believe the correct energy policy is and I think that will be a little careful. I am cheering EEI, so I want to -- I am talking specifically from my book right now, not EEI, okay. One of the most important guys in developing energy policy right now in the Trump campaign, it's been representative from the State of North, Kevin Cramer. We have made our business to have a relationship with Kevin Cramer before. He got into this role in the Trump campaign. Kevin also visited as did a Clinton's representative, the business round table recently. And I think, Kevin is right on the money. He is the guy that is faithful to the Southern dogma of all the above. I think he is reasonable and I think he is the guy we absolutely can work with, he is a great public survey, very thoughtful and understand the importance of all the above in Americas future, he is a terrific guy. Unidentified Analyst : I believe that Southern Company was ones the first or second largest consumer full among utilities. So you probably have a significant ash ponds issue. Could you elaborate a little bit more about that in terms of how you recovering that, how many years you\u2019re thinking about and maybe also where you are on the learning curve and dealing with this? Tom Fanning : And Paul, I'll get you to comment. Paul is -- because of the Georgia jurisdiction kind of the most advanced on this issue. All of our companies, Alabama Power, Mississippi Power, Gulf Power Georgia have all been very proactive on this issue and dealing with each of our commission. And the best way to kind of talk this through is with Paul. But I\u2019ll say, in fact, I said two years ago in Annual Meeting that we would effectively close all of our ash ponds in a proactive way. Paul going forward and I\u2019ll just start off with two kind of again principle or part of our dogma and that is any ash pond near water system or river or something like that we would remove. Otherwise, we will use advance technology and he can talk better than technology to close in place. It\u2019s not just cash it\u2019s advanced technology. And you just got rolling about APB at Georgia that he'll think about. Paul Bowers : So, Barry, when you look at the ash pond programs specifically for Georgia. We had a 29 ash ponds of which all want be regulated by the state EPD, which gives more stringent regulation regime and they have on the national level. National level what is that 18 of our ash ponds have been regulated now it\u2019s not. Our regulatory standpoint think about cost compliance, you have stay through that\u2019s allow you to comply or you have to comply an allocate costs back in turn to recovery. It is Federal Trade Commission for those things or happening. We are removing all the ash located next upon in rivers or one away from rivers and we also or putting the advance engineering technology to ensure no ground source water to go down strain, so we\u2019re contain from an advance engineering. Tom Fanning : For example, subterranean barriers things like that. Paul Bowers : And that is also cover in the new role coming out of Georgia. But all those advance technology is going to be influent. Art, did you want to comment on that recovery? Arthur Beattie : Yes, Barry, a lot of these assets or part of asset retirement obligations. So the customer speaks for them over the life of the assets. So those are accelerate reductions to rate based overtime originally begin to accelerate pay the cash out to do this, it\u2019s actually an increase to rate base. We call a capital investment rather than CapEx because that\u2019s distinguished with this try to make that they both active same and better. Tom Fanning : You should understand that am I try to coming out when I did, as I did. With really granted and nothing more than looking after the customer first, they can sure the community is better off, because where there, we take the obligation of safety and environmental the extremely seriously and we\u2019re proactive on that. That\u2019s why I came out way for anybody has become a hot topic. We always put the community for us and we think this is an important obligation. We take it seriously and we have a great constructive relationship in our states. Mark, you would be the next biggest. Do you have anything you want to say or is that covered? Unidentified Analyst : From padding, how are you thinking about the 5% growth rate projection in terms of sensitivity to the loan growth projections 1% was a 100 just higher moreover you see. Mark Crosswhite : Yes, and that's part of our resilient fleet comment. Basically we know that the Opcos [ph] are going to have trouble in top line growth and see over to 1% industrials will pay a large role in there because they move around so much at least in the negative fashion this year but as we look at it the companies are going to exercise additional capital investments to serve their customers better and try to offset that with cost management to keep a price under control. So we believe our 5% growth rate is true to that scenario. Tom Fanning : You ask the question about its higher. Yes, what here again I'll go back to my comment and it's kind of hard to knock about the balance seen here what is really translates to would be the kind of an acceleration of new generation, kind of where you would see it first. Otherwise it would be an effect on O&M that would be how two effects would be I still think there is upside and downsides around this 5% that's why we didn\u2019t say 4 to 6 and else we said 5 and would kind of hang with that. Yes there is some upside there. What else you want to talk about. I saw the Atlanta Falcon beat the Green Bay Packers yesterday. Matt Ryan, he was awesome anything else? Okay, will listen let me disclose like this we know that was an investment of time on your part. Thank you so much and thank you for being loyal shareholders. Those of you that aren\u2019t I hope you are now I think it's a heck of a story and I'm so proud to represent this team that's team in the industry so many opportunities to go forward in the path and look forward in the future in a positive way. Thank you very much. I think we've got one stead up at here it's being stead up. Yes, stay for lunch we'll all hang around. Aaron Abramovitz : Thanks everyone.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 22, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Suzy. Welcome to Southern Company's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information and slides we released this morning and are available at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. We have a long list of outstanding accomplishments for 2016 and we are well positioned for continued success in 2017 and beyond. We shared many of our 2016 successes at our Analyst Day, but I'd like to recap just a few. Our longest standing strength is the operation of premier state-regulated utilities. The addition of Southern Company Gas broadens our opportunity to leverage our customer-focused business model, which has long supported constructive regulatory relationships, world-class customer satisfaction and regular predictable and sustainable returns on investment. As evidenced by the efficient merger approval processes that were completed in the first half of 2016, all of these newly added LDCs have constructive regulatory framework and well-established regulatory relationships. Recall that one of the key rationales for our acquisition of Southern Company Gas was to create a platform for future growth in gas infrastructure. On the heels of completing the AGL Resources merger, we acquired 50% of Southern Natural Gas which serves the vast majority of our state regulated utilities in the Southeast and is arguably the crown jewel of the interstate natural gas pipelines in the southeastern United States. Not only does our ownership provide for stable long-term earnings and cash flows, it is also expected to provide growth opportunities in the future. At Southern Power, we invested nearly $5 billion in 2016 and began a shift towards wind. At the very end of the year, Southern Power signed an agreement with RES to jointly develop 3,000 megawatts of wind projects with an in-service date of 2018 through 2020. Southern Power will co-originate the PPA's for this pipeline of projects and will procure turbines through two supply agreements with Vestas and Siemens. Our initial turbine purchases in 2016 provide a safe harbor for 100% of the 2016 production tax credit value for the full development pipeline. We plan to invest approximately $1.5 billion per year to grow Southern Power over the next five years and the pipeline of projects under our joint development agreement accounts for most of the expected investments in 2018 through 2020 timeframe. The addition of PowerSecure early last year provides Southern Company with another important option for the future. PowerSecure is well aligned with our customer-focused business model, providing customers with the energy infrastructure solutions they increasingly demand. With the slowing of electricity usage, we've positioned Southern Company to serve a nationwide base of customers on both sides of the meter. This strategy includes opportunities under the alliance we announced with Bloom in late 2016. Much like Southern Power and our interstate natural gas pipeline investments, PowerSecure is positioned to build and own distributed energy infrastructure under long-term contracts in a manner that should provide for regular, predictable and sustainable results. At Vogtle 3 and 4, we continue to make progress on construction. In addition, in December, as another example of constructive regulatory environments that are key to our overall success, the Georgia PSC approved the prudence agreement we announced in October. As a reminder, the Georgia PSC approved our 2015 litigation settlement with Westinghouse. In addition, the PSC either deemed or presumed prudent costs aggregating $5.68 billion while providing contingencies for both cost and schedule. The schedule contingencies provided in the prudence agreement consolidate the project timeline to allow for completion of both units 3 and 4 by December 31, 2020. This PSC action provided more certainty concerning the prudence and collection of project costs for both the company and investors. At Southern Power, we've already announced the acquisition of the Bethel Wind Energy Center. This 276 megawatt facility is now in service and places Southern Power's ownership in renewable generation resources north of 3,200 megawatts. In addition to wind project, natural gas generation under long-term contract remains a priority for Southern Power. As you recall, we acquired the Mankato combined cycle facility last year. The Bethel Wind project and the expansion of Mankato represent approximately $600 million of Southern Power's $1.5 billion growth capital for 2017. At Southern Company Gas, yesterday's approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM rate, that's GRAM rate structure by the Georgia PSC is yet another example of a constructive regulatory framework for our premier state-regulated utilities. This forward-looking mechanism will provide timely recovery of important infrastructure and growth investments in Georgia over the long term. In addition, Southern Natural Gas recently filed a proposal with FERC for expansion of the natural gas lateral that serves Plant McDonough-Atkinson in Georgia with an estimated investment of $240 million. Our 50% share of this investment, $120 million, is part of the $300 million placeholder CapEx we included for pipelines in our Analyst Day materials. In 2016, by expanding our premier state-regulated utility portfolio, continuing to invest in energy infrastructure projects under long-term contract and financing our 2016 growth on very favorable terms, we were able to extend our EPS outlook to five years with an EPS growth rate of approximately 5%. Our EPS outlook is resilient to a variety of different outcomes and supports our regular, predictable, and sustainable objectives. And subject to board approval, that should enable us to follow-through on the dividend policy we outlined at our Analyst Day in October. I'll turn the call over now to Art for a financial and economic review. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, the adjusted results for the fourth quarter met our estimates and we exceeded our guidance on an adjusted basis for the full year of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we had reported earnings of $197 million or $0.20 per share compared with $271 million or $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year of 2016, reported earnings were $2.45 billion or $2.57 per share compared with $2.37 billion or $2.60 per share in 2015. On an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter of 2016, consistent with our estimate provided at our Analyst Day, Southern Company earned $235 million or $0.24 a share during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $403 million or $0.44 per share during the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year of 2016, on an adjusted basis, Southern Company earned $2.73 billion, or $2.89 a share compared with earnings of $2.63 billion, or $2.89 a share for the same period in 2015. A reconciliation of our as-reported and as-adjusted results is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted annual result of $2.89 per share was just above the top of the 2016 guidance range we established a year ago. The major earnings drivers when compared to our $2.89 per share adjusted results for 2015 were retail revenue effects of our regulated electric utilities, weather and continued growth at Southern Power. These positive drivers were offset by the issuance of additional shares, higher non-fuel O&M expense, higher depreciation and lower weather-adjusted retail electric usage. A more comprehensive list of drivers is included in the materials we released this morning. We continue to see retail electricity customers using less. This trend is true for all classes, especially commercial. Industrial sales are lower due to persistent strength in the dollar, weaker demand for domestic manufactured products and lower oil prices, hitting three of our largest industrial segments in 2016, chemicals, paper and primary metals. However, the outlook is somewhat brighter in 2017 with prospects of potential infrastructure spending, lower tax rates and higher levels of confidence as reflected by the ISM Manufacturing Index, which rose to 56 in January, a two-year high. Residential sales are flat, influenced by increased levels of efficiency and a continued trend from single-family homes to multifamily housing. Commercial sales trends are reflective of similar moves to more efficient lighting and HVAC systems as well as an increase in ecommerce, putting pressure on the growth of bricks and mortar retail stores. Our expectation for retail electric sales growth over the next several years, as we outlined at our Analyst Day, are between zero and 1%. In the near term, we expect 2017 electric sales growth to be towards the lower end of that range. Somewhat offsetting declining retail electric sales is strong customer growth, especially in Georgia and Florida. As we look across our state-regulated footprint, which now covers nine states, we are seeing employment and population growth consistent with national trends, with slightly stronger growth in Georgia where we serve both gas and electric markets. Southern Company Gas has experienced strong customer growth in its gas distribution territories especially in Georgia, Florida and Tennessee. This reflects an increase in migration to these states and strong employment growth. In our gas and electric markets, our economic development pipeline remains robust as most of our states are well positioned to create jobs over the next several years and we expect to support continued customer growth and infrastructure investment. Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I'd like to cover a few final items. First, our earnings estimate for the first quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.57 per share in the first quarter of 2017. We are also reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance from our Analyst Day of $2.90 to $3.02 per share for the full year 2017 and an EPS growth rate of approximately 5% for the next five years. Secondly, I'd like to touch on potential tax reform legislation. No doubt we will all be keeping a close eye on this issue, but we also know predicting the outcome is impossible. There are two very public proposals garnering attention, one, from the Trump administration and one from House Republicans. Both proposals focus on three primary elements : reducing the corporate tax rate, expensing of capital expenditures and eliminating the interest deduction. Each of these elements impacts customers and shareholders in different ways and it is far too early to know exactly how these proposals might be implemented, or exactly what, if any, transition rules would be established. Having acknowledged that uncertainty, let me share some potential impacts of the major tax reform proposals under a few different scenarios. We estimate that the administration's proposal would be slightly accretive to EPS through 2021. When considering the three major elements of the Republican \u2013 House Republican proposal, the impacts could range from slightly accretive to approximately 5% dilutive through 2021 depending on the underlying assumptions. In all of our House Republican plan scenarios, we have assumed a 20% tax rate. However, there are a wide range of assumptions related to capital and interest deductibility. Our worst-case scenario assumes no interest is deductible and there are no incremental investments to offset potential rate-based reductions relating to deducting 100% of capital. Our best case assumes interest on existing debt is grandfathered and that incremental capital projects offset reductions in rate base. We are engaged with policymakers regarding tax reform on several fronts. Our priorities are preserving both the interest deduction and current tax treatment on CapEx as well as ensuring fair and comprehensive transition rules. I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Art. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to briefly address our two major generation projects. Progress at Vogtle 3 and 4 construction site continues and the actions of our contractor are indicative of a focused commitment to improve productivity in critical path areas of construction and to complete projects in a timely manner. We are closely monitoring the status of Toshiba and Westinghouse. Our fixed-price contract continues to protect customers and shareholders alike. Westinghouse has provided us with an updated schedule that reflects commercial operations date of December 2019 for Unit 3 and September 2020 for Unit 4. The company is currently reviewing this schedule in an effort to confirm that these projected dates align with our expectation. The prudent settlement approved by the Georgia PSC in December provides flexibility to accommodate these schedule changes. You will recall that the PSC order prescribes the completion of both units by year end 2020. And we are seeing improvements in productivity and believe this momentum will be sustained given the recent announcements by Toshiba and WEC. At the Kemper Project, we achieved integrated operations of both gasifier trains and combustion turbines in late January. Following a short outage in early February to make modifications and improvements to clean the gas cleanup systems, the plant returned to integrated operations of both trains including the capture of CO2 and the production of sulfuric acid and ammonia, all of acceptable quality under the related off-take agreements. On Monday; however, Mississippi Power determined that an outage to remove ash deposits from gasifier B's ash removal system was necessary. Gasifier B has been producing syngas 60% of the time since November of last year. During the outage, gasifier A and combustion turbine A are expected to remain in operation, producing electricity from syngas as well as producing chemical byproducts. As a result of this latest outage work, we are currently expected to reach sustained operation and place the full IGCC facility into service by middle of March. Mississippi Power expects to file for an accounting order from the Mississippi PSC that will allow deferral of depreciation and operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $25 million per month pre-tax for the assets placed in service until rates are in place. Our 2017 EPS guidance assumes receipt of this accounting order. In the coming months, Mississippi Power expects to file for cost recovery with the Mississippi PSC. We plan to file both a traditional rate case and an alternative multiyear rate mitigation plan, as provided for under Mississippi legislation passed in 2013. Our goal is to achieve an outcome that balances the interests of customers and investors alike, an objective which often presents challenges. Our commitment to the financial integrity of Mississippi Power and Southern Company has not changed. As we have done to-date, Southern Company expects to maintain a capital structure and credit metrics for Mississippi Power supportive of investment grade ratings. Likewise, we plan to continue targeting a minimum 16% FFO to debt metric over the long term at The Southern Company level. Moreover, our overall objectives as a company remain constant. We continue to believe that focusing on the customer, operating premier state-regulated utilities and investing in energy infrastructure projects under long-term contracts will continue to support regular, predictable, sustainable, long-term earnings and dividend growth for our investors. Our tremendous successes in 2016 provided the foundation for a resilient financial outlook, including approximately 5% growth in earnings per share. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Our first question coming from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I had a question on Kemper. And I guess in your last Form 8-K, you referenced the economic viability analysis that you were going to update and I believe the Form 8-K says that this has been negatively affected by cost and the lower gas price forecast. Can you give us any more specifics on what negatively affected means? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, sure. So let me first give the context. I guess we've been filing these economic viability analyses since about 2009, somewhere around there, did it annually as a requirement through 2014. In 2015, I guess the Commission of the staff asked us to file another and we did. And then the idea was to update that whenever we saw a major change. We didn't see a major change in 2015, so we didn't file one there. And then in 2016, the predominant change that we saw really related to a lower long-term gas price forecast. That was kind of by far the major effect. And it resulted in a reduction of gas price forecasts of 25% to 30%. Now, when you look at the outcome of the so-called 3x3 matrix, so there's nine boxes, essentially what you're able to see is that throughout time, this project has been somewhere between six to nine boxes that are green. That means that as currently formulated, the plan is economic relative to variances in high, low and medium gas prices and some spread of what carbon costs or price may be. The latest especially result of a new gas price forecast reduced the number of green boxes to three. If you had not had the reduction of long-term gas price forecast in this current edition, we would have been back to around six green boxes. So, Jonathan, I guess my advice to people looking at that is kind of this : the real result is due to the reduction in the long-term gas price forecast. That's the overwhelming change, the big change. Obviously, there are others. It is a point in time. When we had this plant certificated, we all thought that gas prices were going to be double digits and there was some spread that were way higher than where we are now. And recall again, and it was interesting. I actually went back in conjunction with this last board meeting we just had, as I started to think about the whole regulatory situation and recovery. And going back to 2008 when this plant was first filed for in Mississippi, it was really structured as a gas-price hedge. In other words, we saw volatile and high gas prices and nobody figured that gas prices will fall this low. But at the time Mississippi was looking at being exposed to 70% gas generation and 30% coal, adding Plant Ratcliffe, Kemper County to the mix gave us kind of a third exposure to gas prices, a third Kemper and a third coal prices. Interestingly, Mississippi's customers have been able to benefit from the dropping gas prices along the way because, as you know, our combined cycle gas turbine has been in service and has been having an operations profile much better than what you typically find in the United States; so all that to say is it's an input. The big change is really related to gas prices. Obviously, operating costs did go up since 2015 about $40 million a year, but it'll just be part of the input that goes into the evaluation of recovery. I'm very happy to say that once we achieve in-service, we will be able to give the regulators and the customers of Mississippi essentially what was certificated back in 2010. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Tom, let's follow up on that. Is there a scenario where the sort of lack of green boxes causes someone \u2013 is there a determination to be made that it would be better for customers just to run this as a gas plant? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Jonathan, I suppose there's a million different scenarios we could evaluate. The good news is and you folks know as well as we do and it's been a painful process. Getting to this point, we certainly have taken our lumps, but we have delivered what was certificated back in 2010, I think we will, and we'll see how that goes, based on the order, we're going to give them what was required for us to build and we'll see how that discussion goes. Certainly there's a lot of different ways the regulatory process could unfold from there, but that's our starting point. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, Tom, thank you for the full answer. I appreciate it. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Always appreciate you calling in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: How are you doing? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Quite well. Thank you very much. So perhaps just to kick it off where Jonathan left it. Can you elaborate a little bit more on this filing in Mississippi around the $25 million a month? What's the timeframe for that to kick into effect, what should we be tracking there... (28:27) Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, exactly, sorry, apologies. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. That's all right. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Is that a good leading indicator on thinking about ultimate recovery of Kemper in a future rate case? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I really don't think it is, to be honest with you. It's interesting. So once we go in-service, we think on a pre-tax basis, the run rate's about $25 million a month. What it will be \u2013 when we file for tax and accounting in-service is essentially prescribed by accounting and tax rules. So when we hit that level, we think that four or five days of continuous integrated operation will make that determination. We're having some conversations with the Mississippi staff about what the kind of threshold for our operation will be in order to get the accounting order, but everybody should understand that whether these costs fall inside an accounting order or outside, until we get an accounting order, they will all be subject to review and recovery under the rate filings. So really just has to do with the accounting presentation in the meantime. I think the general thrust of the staff is that they want to see more sustained operation as yet undefined beyond what's required in order to call this thing in-service for tax and accounting purposes. We're having those discussions now. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Awesome. And then moving back to the other side of major project. You discussed productivity trends going well thus far. Where are we in that kind of hiring process ramping up? Are we almost done with that? And then just to be clear about what you said earlier, I assume that between any kind of liquidated damages from the consortium and the fixed price guarantee that ultimately, there's fairly limited changes to your or customer-incurred costs as a result? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I think there's almost no changes to incurred costs. I mean, it's pretty clear. We've been meeting with management. In fact, Steve Kuczynski, our CEO of Nuclear and I met with, I want to say Westinghouse's Chairman, Toshiba's Chairman, I think the President of Westinghouse in D.C. in December, Paul Bowers and the team there. He's our CEO of Georgia Power, have been meeting with management all along the way. So you should view us as having a reasonably continuous contact with management. It's very clear to us. I think it's clear to the contractor that all these issues, especially issues related to productivity at the site are for their account. In all the media releases that you have seen, there has never been a dispute raised to that effect. The predicate of your question was just a wee bit off, though. One of our predicates of the question was that staffing wasn't where it needs to be. Really, staffing is, Julien, I think the bigger issue there is productivity of the staffing that exists. And interestingly and I think we have a slide in the deck \u2013 did we find a slide in the deck? It's page 23 that \u2013 and it's in the appendix. It shows the productivity, if you will. It's a productivity-looking slide, anyway, of various activities that were accomplished in Unit 3 and then the duration of those activities later for Unit 4. And what you can see by that chart is effectively true that broadly, productivity at Unit 4 is a lot better and we're learning a lot from having undertaken activities at Unit 3. So that's why you see the difference in the change in schedule from six months and three months. It really has nothing to do with the amount of staffing on site. The amount of people we need are on site. Further, we believe Westinghouse is pulling in the best nuclear construction people and project management talent from all over the country to augment their efforts on site particularly in the nuclear island. And so, they are all about trying to improve their productivity and improve their own financial results. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. That's fair. And then, yeah, just confirming that there is no \u2013 it changed for consumers, right, and yourselves, more importantly. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. No. In fact, what you should \u2013 the way I think about LDs (33:12) is they really offset owners' costs for any delay. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. So I just wanted to confirm that I guess V.C. Summer is going to be, looks like a few months behind you, right, so you're ahead of them by about three to four months; is that right? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You ought to ask them that. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Do you think that \u2013 all right. So you don't have any opinion as to why you guys might be a few months ahead of them or whether... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We really try to stay away from those things. I think we're much better served paying attention to our own project at this point. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And there's no change to the cost of the projects as far as you can see... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Not to us, not cost to our customers, no. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Okay. And... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And the schedule remains within the prescription that we settled that was agreed to by the Public Service Commission in the settlement and the prudence hearings. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. Has there been in any movement on the IRS review of tax credits or anything like that at this point? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: We're waiting on the Congressional tax committee, joint committee of Congress, and we believe that sometime in the first half of this year that we should hear something from them. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And you're referring to the Section 174 deduction? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, that's the Section 174. I assume, Michael, that's what you're asking about. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right, right. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: For Kemper. Okay. Not for Vogtle, right? Kemper? Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Okay. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. And I guess that's about it for now. Thanks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks buddy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Anthony, how are you? Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Another way in sell-side paradise. How about yourself? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Absolutely, my friend. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: How are you doing Frank? Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey, it's better. The last call, I got called Steven, so Frank's not that bad. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Or Bill or whatever. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Just obviously everyone's hoping for a great outcome at Kemper, the company's been making progress. But is there a scenario that happens at Kemper where Southern, the parent, no longer supports the operating company? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We've been over that a lot. We try to evaluate every potential card that could get turned up on the table here. It's our belief that we will maintain our support from Mississippi Power in the manner that we have described. It's just not in anybody's interest to consider in any serious way something other than that. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Congrats on a good end of 2016 and nice start to 2017. Real quick on Vogtle and then I'm going to turn to Southern Natural Gas for a second. On Vogtle, the projects are getting closer, meaning the Unit 4's in-service date is, I think, you said September 2020. What happens if this pushes out another couple of months into 2021? How should we think about the risk to things like production tax credits or \u2013 meaning the ability to qualify for them or for things like bonus depreciation treatment for Vogtle 3 and 4 if they come on line after 2020? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, so I'll hit production tax credits and let you do bonus, but, listen, our team in Washington is working really hard to get an extension for the two projects that are under construction. And so we're working that angle and we think actually there is a good vehicle, good circumstances in which to make that happen. The second thing that I would say to you is this six-month and three-month kind of extension to the schedule. If something we're reviewing, when you look at that slide that I showed you, our \u2013 that I talked about before, yeah, page 23, Vogtle Unit 3 versus Unit 4 duration. Our position has been that, gosh, we ought to be able to hit Unit 4 really pretty well on \u2013 without any kind of three-month schedule extension. I think the schedule extension there may do more with staging work among or between the different units rather than the productivity we're seeing at Unit 4. So I think Unit 4's schedule remains absolutely under discussion and we'll see where that goes. Over the next month or so, we're kind of tying the proposed schedule change to what the lower-level schedules would indicate right now. We have to make sure those things all gee-haw, if you will. So that'll be the topic of a lot of review over the next four to six weeks. Art, do you want to talk about bonus? I'm sorry, go ahead, yeah. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, just on the PTC, is the goal to try and get an extension in the PTC date kind of as part \u2013 a part and parcel or an amendment to some broader tax package or is this going to try and get this done in some separate type of legislation? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We've actually had a lot of different kind of ways to do this. We'll see. And then \u2013 let me just tell you there's a lot of support in Congress for this. This is not an adversarial or any kind of controversial thing. Getting stuff done in Congress, as we all know, is hard, so \u2013 but it's got a lot of support. But my... Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Mike. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, Art, yeah. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Do you want to know about bonus? Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: What happens if the plants come on line post 2020, what's the treatment for bonus D&A if they don't meet an end of year 2020 in-service? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I believe it's zero. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Of course, all that's subject to change under what's being proposed, so we'll see what happens. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. And then finally, Southern Natural Gas, you introduced the new lateral off of the pipeline where you're a 50% owner with a large midstream company. Do you see a lot of other opportunities like that and do you see those coming to fruition over the next three to five years, meaning bolt-on projects, bolt-on laterals or even storage, or is the growth, kind of the bigger growth off of that pipeline, off of that position more longer term than that? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah we \u2013 I think we did at our Analyst Day, we outlined $300 million of opportunity and this is a piece of that $300 million. And we're looking at other opportunities jointly with Kinder Morgan on opportunities just like this. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Beyond the $300 million placeholder, if you go back to Rich Kinder's analyst call after we announced the acquisition of 50% of Sonat, he referred to a lot more growth opportunities. We support those things. We're aware of them. We're working with him where it makes sense. None of those additional growth opportunities are in our financial plan. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thanks, Art. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: You bet, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Ali, welcome. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question, Tom, just wanted to clarify your earlier comments, this economic viability test at Kemper, so just to understand, is this one of the tools that the Commission is going to use to determine what investment gets recovered as part of the rate case filing? And this last test where you had the three in green boxes, is that really what goes in front of them when they're doing that analysis or will there be any updates to this? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, I mean it's just another piece of input that goes into the process. It's nothing more than that. We know that gas forecasts have changed a lot over time. And with respect to whether we should recover it or not, I don't think \u2013 I mean as a matter of fairness, I cannot imagine that the company is going to be held accountable for changing gas price forecasts. We all entered into this certificate, this order from the Commission in 2010 with the understanding that this was a gas hedge and, in fact, it remains a gas hedge. There are still green boxes on the economic viability analysis which would indicate that under certain scenarios, this is a very economic thing to do. And let me remind you, if you had 2015's gas forecast instead of 2016/2017 gas forecast, you would have six green boxes. So, just because you have this more recent snapshot of what we believe about the future, which we all know has changed dramatically over time, that does not mean anything about the imprudency of costs incurred. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then switching to Vogtle, as you said, you've been, obviously, closely in contact with Toshiba, Westinghouse. Just remind us in the scenario that for whatever reason Toshiba's financial health implodes further or they are no longer committed, what are the backstops and what would be the scenario if they cannot complete the rest of their obligations? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, Ali, some of that is public, but they are \u2013 we have every reason to believe that Toshiba is going to remain viable. They have recognized the fact that they do have an obligation as a parental guarantee under these contracts. We believe it's in their best interests from an economic perspective to complete these projects and our expectation is that they will and that's what we've been communicated to by them. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And if you think about it, when you look at the credit banks that support Toshiba and the government, they own about 20% of the stock. Further, there's about 170,000 employees in Japan and elsewhere that are impacted by the viability of Toshiba. Further, the nuclear renaissance in Japan, such as it may be, the cleanup from Fukushima and then restarting other nuclear reactors, Toshiba has a central part of that role for Japan. They're just an important player in the economy and we continue to get feedback that Abe's administration supports Toshiba. Two other financial facts; one financial fact. We have and we've disclosed this I think a lot, almost $1 billion, $920 million of letters of credit and further we have a multibillion-dollar guarantee to Toshiba the parent. So there's a lot of reasons why we believe, including Toshiba's own statements and moves that are now in the press that I should just let you look at in the press rather than me comment them that Toshiba's taken hard steps necessary to improve their financial viability and that they remain committed to these two projects. Ultimately, success on Vogtle will inure to the success of Toshiba long-term. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Fair enough. And last question we've been seeing consistently, Tom, the weather-normalized sales have remained negative, in fact got a little worse in the fourth quarter, negative 1.5%. I know you alluded to some of this, Art, perhaps in your commentary, but what is causing this consistent negativity and what's the optimism that we see, at least flat, if not slightly better as we look at 2017 and beyond? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. It's really this and we're seeing it at the Fed, too. I'm not going to mix (46:21) the data for you, but the strength of the dollar has slowed exports, number one. Number two, low oil prices have slowed things like expansion of pipelines and a variety of other things. So we have seen already those effects weigh on industrial sales. In the commercial sector, we've seen real improvement in terms of office occupancy and a variety of other measures. But there is a secular change, we think, going on in the commercial sector really related to ecommerce that is changing the nature of big-box department stores particularly. Further, we are seeing things like energy efficiency take a lot bigger share, particularly lighting and HVAC, from the commercial sector. On the residential sector, we're seeing, we think, at least for now \u2013 of course, that sounds kind of weird, for now a secular change, but a secular change away from kind of primary housing in the 70%-30% to multifamily more to primary 60%, multifamily 40%. We think those things may be generational, in other words, the younger generation not wanting to get tied down under a mortgage and home ownership and actually prefer the flexibility of apartments. It could be still people under recovery. It could be people not wanting to extend their credit risk from a household standpoint and we have seen at the Federal level larger savings rates in the household income level. All of those things would suggest that the residential buying power isn't what people had hoped it would be in the past, say, three years. The good news is that we still see an influx of customers into the Southeast. And when you think about it, not just the Southeast; if you add together Southern Company Gas and the traditional electric operating companies at Southern Company, you're talking about 70,000 new customers. We went from 4.5 million customers to 9 million customers. And one of the things we're definitely looking at is how do we increase the margin, how can we increase more sales and more value associated with having a customer, whether we sell either therms or electrons in front of the meter or whether we put energy infrastructure on the other side of the meter. Fortunately, this thrust on the other side of the meter is happening outside our territory, high price, low reliability, low customer satisfaction areas. The Southeast remains a bastion of strength in that regard, low prices, great service, great customer satisfaction. So, look, what we're trying to do is take advantage of all of our natural resources to improve our own organic growth, but where we're losing organic growth to things like beyond the meter sales or energy efficiency, we're playing offense where we can to improve our posture and gaining value from customers there, whether they're inside our territory or not. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it, one last clarification. The 5% growth over the next five years, that's pretty straight line, it's not front end or back end loaded, is that the way we should think about? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah it's pretty straight line, yeah. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Just take the bottom of the range and the top of the range and grow them by time; that's what we showed you in October and we stand behind that. And that permits, assuming the board continues to agree, our dividend policy that we outlined in October as well. I think that should show everybody in the investment community great strength and belief in our future. And remember, this is not just lengthen, it's strengthen. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenmark (sic) [Glenrock]. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hey, how is it going? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. How are you? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I'm managing. I wanted to touch base on Vogtle. So I hear you on the confidence and all the good points you're bringing up on Toshiba and its economic needs, but your partner to the North, SCANA, not your partner, but whatever, the guys who got the nuclear plants as well, they seem to be taking some potential contingency planning with respect to whether or not Westinghouse can complete the project from seeing potentially other contractors or even themselves taking a role. And I was wondering are you guys looking at anything like that or... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Sure. Look, and again, I don't want to compare to SCANA. I will not do that. I will just tell you about what we're doing and that is, I hope I get these numbers right. We have about 400 people on site involved in oversight and have had that and recall that we've had people all over the world in the supply chain. I would argue that Southern Company, unlike anybody else in the United States, has the technical depth to be able to step in if we need to and finish the project. Further, we have all the contractual rights with respect to getting IP to make sure that we can run the project successfully, et cetera. We've been through every one of those contingencies. I think those are way more tail risk than they are substantive, but if they ever become substantive, we are primed and ready to go. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, great. And then with respect to Kemper, looking through this 2017 economic viability analysis, for some reason, I'm not sure if it's redacted, it just doesn't appear to be there, the actual gas price assumptions. And I was wondering if you guys could tell us on the high end what those gas price assumptions are, the ones with the green boxes. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I'll give you a point estimate. At 2020, the hygas forecast is a wee bit over $5 per million Btu. So think about volatility and gas prices, could you be at $5 by 2020 conceivably? And then beyond 2020, there's obviously a trend that continues to grow in that manner. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Now, you guys are clearly in sort of the testing phase and what have you; so you guys want the gasifiers and everything to work. But in the current environment, it sounds like you probably \u2013 it would be more economic to run the plant just simply on natural gas and not run the gasifier. Is that correct or I mean how long would this testing phase sort of go through \u2013 would you expect the phase in which you'd have to sort of run the gasifiers just to show that it's working okay? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet, man. Yeah, Paul I got you. I got you. So here we go. So, actually, when we've had the gasifiers kind of ready to go, they've actually been performing pretty well. Like I say, we've been able to demonstrate once they're ready to go, they're in the 50% to 60% availability. Remember, all we talk about during this first year is something like 35% availability. So who knows what it will be over a year, so I don't want to guarantee anything, but we're actually happy once we get the things up and running and look at the way A is running right now. The other issue that I think is important and inherent in your question is this notion of what is the energy value of the plant to Mississippi's customers. And I've talked about this a lot in the past and, actually, I've been reasonably conservative in how I've postured that. I've used, I think, the range of numbers with you all on a gas-price equivalent at about a, I don't know, $2.75 to $3 per million Btu equivalent. That didn't include all of the value of the by-product sales and it really probably hived off more O&M than what our people would traditionally use in a dispatch assessment. And we have run this thing back through our system planning people. If you do the traditional dispatch assessment and you include the value of all the by-product sales, we believe this thing will dispatch out at about $1.75 per million Btu. So from a used and useful standpoint, this plant has tremendous energy value. Now, would you rather run the plant, keep it going \u2013 it has a rather large fixed O&M component and get the benefit of the energy or would you rather convert and just run on natural gas is kind of the question you'd get to and that underlies, I think, your point. But these are things that we will discuss with the Commission as we file the rate case. The other thing that that analysis still ignores is what's the value of the plant as a gas hedge? So there is absolute value there. It'll be interesting to see how all that assessment goes forward. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Welcome. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Hey, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks, guys. So first question on the tax reform side, the slide you provided was helpful, but wanted to get a little bit more context more specifically at the holding company level. Could you give us some color on the earnings impact at the holding company level if the interest deduction went away? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, that's included in our worst-case scenario. Obviously, the holding company would be a heavyweight on the downside for tax deductibility and so it's incorporated into that scenario. All we've really tried to do, Praful, is just to outline the top and the bottom scenarios, but there roughly is about $0.5 million a year... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: ...$0.5 billion. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: ...$0.5 billion a year of interest expense that's exposed, so, what we've done is project that out to 2021. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's helpful. And then as you think about the commercial segment and the additional CapEx at the commercial segment, clearly that is funded with CapEx at the holding company. So wanted to understand with the tax reform, not just the interest deductibility, but broadly tax reform, how does the commercial segment growth get exposed both from the economics associated with holding company leverage and other tax reform that might impact economics at the project level for the commercial segment? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Praful, when we talk about commercial, we're talking about the commercial class in our regulated business. We're not talking about the unregulated businesses which I think that you're referring to. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: If you're talking about... Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, my question is more directed at the unregulated investment. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's correct. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, if you're talking Southern Power, they finance off their own balance sheet. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's correct. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Not at the parent level. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's right. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right, but interest deductibility will still impact the economics; so will other tax reforms. So what I'm trying to get at is how do those projects and the growth of those projects get impacted by the tax reform? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, listen, I mean I've been walking around the hill on this. I chair EEI and I have a finance background and we kind of go through all these things with all the people that we should, both in the White House administration and Congress, both on the House and the Senate. And I can just tell you there's interesting nomenclature up there and this notion of eliminating interest deductibility is a grand experiment and has the ability in a very near term to radically change. Of course, this depends on how this thing is factored in over time, transitional, but radically change how America finances long-term capital. And if we're trying to stimulate long-term capital, I'm not sure that that's the right way to go. On the flipside, you say, well, how can we help on the national income statement? There's this idea about expensing capital. I understand some people like that. But given the long-term nature of the kind of capital that this industry commits to, whether you give bonus depreciation or not has very little influence on our spending habits. We really do, for example, Vogtle, Kemper transmission lines, these are long-term trending capital commitments and varying tax treatment over time has very little influence on our behavior. We always do what's right for customers. So when you think about it, it makes much more sense and these things in scoring are really pretty close. Keeping interest deductibility is about equal to keeping the current tax depreciation and not expensing CapEx. The government is purporting to give us a benefit that really has very little value. So that's kind of where we are on all that. With respect of Southern Power and what the incremental effect may be, I think we've been awfully famous over the years and enormously successful. We've done this for the Board, Art, our ex post review of the performance of the portfolio at Southern Power and it even exceeded ex post our review of what was required by our own disciplined IRR approach. The other thing that you just have to understand is there's a lot of people around those deals right now, particularly tax equity, projects without tax credits. There's all sorts of uncertainty going forward. Just rest assured we'll use the same discipline and my sense is the market will react to that as well. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful context. So just to understand, the Southern Power CapEx, like the $8 billion that you have from 2017 to 2021, do you see any risk with that spend depending on what happens on tax reform? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, there's uncertainty with respect to tax reform. But you should know that by virtue of the agreement that we signed with RES and then ultimately with the turbine suppliers that we have safe harbored our PTCs in the 100%. And you show me, but I am not aware of any tax law change in which they unwound commercial decisions once entered into. So my sense is from the value of the PTC that we just entered into with that arrangement last December, we think that will persist under any tax reform. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's really helpful. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Andy. Great to have you with us. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Thanks, Tom. I appreciate it. I hope everything is good with you all. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Just a couple questions. Maybe just \u2013 I just have some questions on Kemper and on Vogtle. So on Kemper, the only thing I think that I have left is, in your 10-K, you talk about $105 million of increased O&M annually, possibly I guess on the disclosure here. Could you just describe that and who would pay for that? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, we have already \u2013 are you talking about the 20 \u2013 first year O&M, is that what you're referring to? Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : It says operations, main expenses have increased an average of $105 million annually and maintenance capital has increased by $44 million... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : ...for the first full five years of... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, we talked about, at the Analyst Day, I think, the fact that we had an additional $68 million in the first year and that we were going to expense those in the first year of operations, so that is included. As we go through, and I think Tom talked about it already, and look at the fixed O&M cost associated with the asset, that is part of the negotiation that we'll go through with the regulator around what's best option for customers. So it is part of the equation that we're going to through and it's incorporated. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Andy. Yeah. And you may be referring to O&M that was in place, estimated way back in 2000. It actually probably first got filed around 2008, was subject to review in 2009. Part of the order in early 2010 and that dealt with a level of O&M that was estimated at that time. That since has been updated; in 2015, it was updated to $100 million and then most recently in October, again revised in November of last year, was updated to around $140 million. So the increase over, say, 2015 till now is about $40 million a year. So I think what you're reading is probably from the certificate level. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Right. Okay. So the bottom line is that... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You can't get the benefit.... Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : ...renegotiated... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. You can't get the benefit of the plant \u2013 all those energy savings I mentioned without that O&M, you can't separate the two. And recall also, in 2012 the Commission specified the operational parameters that we're going to have to stand up to. We believe we can hit those parameters. O&M is not part of those parameters. Those things deal like with availability, heat rate and by-product sales and something else. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. And then I guess this issue about removing ash deposits has kind of plagued, maybe I'm inaccurate, but have plagued both gasifiers. Can you maybe just describe kind of what that issue is, again not in a long way? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I'll do it in a short way, the very short way. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : How does that get resolved? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, sure there were really two different kinds of issues. But one of the things we've always said about this was, if you remember one of the big technical risks was lignite in, ash out, that was kind of one. And then the other one you may remember from years past and you've been around us for a few years is this notion of the instrumentation and getting all the digital controls synchronized. Remember this is a pretty complex plant. I'm happy to say all the instrumentation has, even though it's complex, has really performed terrific, so we haven't had hardly any problems with that. With respect to lignite in and ash out, I think we've \u2013 part of regular start-up practice is to iron out all the bumps in the roads. And I think you may remember from all the conversation in the past about lignite dryers and all those other stuff, we solved lignite in. Ash out, we've kind of had two different kinds of problems. This one recently is a really different one. Okay. The outages that we took in the fall were related to clinkers and what they dealt with was ash that was melted due to some temperature excursions as we brought the plants into and out of service. We think we've solved all of those problems. This latest problem really dealt with the notion that on Train B, I guess, we started and stopped it about 7 or 8 times and this is \u2013 they use the word agglomeration. But if you can imagine, there are vertical and horizontal pipes in this plant. And what we have seen is, when you turn the plant on and off, the fluidization inside the circulating fluidized bed boiler stops. And whatever ash is in there will sit on a horizontal pipe. And what they think happened in this latest run was that some of the ash just started sticking to each other. When a plant is running and the velocity of the ash is going through the plant, it doesn't stick and it performs exactly the way you want it to. They think it just stuck together, so they're going to take the plant out of service, get it out, start it up, and they think it'll run fine. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : So is that like more of a \u2013 I guess, obviously it's an engineering issue, but it's trying to predict kind of the right heat to use? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. But we've done that. That's the early problem and they've solved it. And one of the advantages \u2013 just to remind you, this thing runs at a lower temperature, therefore less O&M. You don't have clinking and scaling and its operational performance should be better than a conventional boiler. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. I think I understand it. I guess we can talk more about it next week. And then \u2013 up in Boston and then up... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, great. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Yeah, that was exciting. And then... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Although we don't want to go to Boston, you know. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. It's all right; I wish the Giants got that far. And then on the Vogtle side, so just to understand, I guess you have this letter of credit. And I have gone over it with IR, but I just want to make sure that I'm clear on it. This letter of credit which is $920 million or $930 million and your portion of that is 45% of that. That expires every July, is that right, and then needs to be renewed? Is that correct or is that incorrect? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I believe that the banks are in the position to renew it automatically every year. If they fail to renew it, there's a 60-day notice on the bank's part to let them know they're not going to renew. We have an option if they do that and that Toshiba can't replace the LOC to draw on a 30-day notice. So we're in \u2013 we think we're in good shape around all that. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : So there doesn't have to be a default, which is right now why \u2013 when you would draw that if it... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: It's kind of one of the conditions. I wouldn't call that a default, but if the... Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : No, no, that wouldn't be a default. But if they fail to, so obviously, you know, forget them pulling it, right, the bottom line is if there's a default or something like that, you obviously could draw on it. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And just recall the reason they had to post these letters of credit is because their financial condition fell below a certain level. So long as their financial condition is at that level, they have to provide LCs or they're in default. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Right, but if the banks decide to pull it, you within that 30 to 60-day window of when you're informed, you can actually draw on that letter of credit; is that correct? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's it. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Correct. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Right, okay. And then do the banks I mean, I guess who's money is it? Is it Toshiba's money or the bank's money that is that 900 and whatever million dollars? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It's our money at that point, pal. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : No, no I get that part, I'm saying but right now. It's a bank guarantee, right? Right the banks go over Toshiba, right? You get the money. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It's the bank's money. It's the bank's money and Toshiba is a creditor to the bank. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Right. And is there a scenario where the banks just decide not to pay you or is that kind of out there farfetched type thing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's pretty farfetched, my friend. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. Okay. And I think that's it. I actually \u2013 in a bankruptcy situation for Toshiba, how does your fixed cost contract kind of work? And I guess the letter of credit stands; so that's fine, but do you just become a creditor or is there any type of backstop in that type of scenario? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We have the LCs and other than that we're an unsecured creditor. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Got it. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We just think that's really unlikely. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : The bankruptcy or the unsecured creditor part? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: The bankruptcy part. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Andy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hello, Tom, how are you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome, hope you're well. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: You got that Hinkley yet? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, man, I'm working on it. I'm working on it. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: You're working on a few things I guess? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. No kidding. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: One of the Form 8-Ks a few months back talked about sustainability of nitrogen with Train A and Train B simultaneously. I assume that's been fixed or you wouldn't be this far? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Here is the deal; we need supplemental nitrogen in order to basically start up both trains. But we have the technical performance profile that once we are in operation, we don't need to supplement nitrogen that we are able to run the process and the nitrogen on site is sufficient. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And back to energy efficiency. You keep seeing usage per customer decline. Does that plateau or is technology kind of keep moving the bar on you enough that this can go on for several more years? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's an interesting question. And I think you'd have to talk about different markets. In the commercial market, we think it may have a little ways to go. In the residential market, it's just a matter of change-out of appliances and how many new multifamily units are in place versus single-family homes. So that ebbs and flows over time. And I think we're seeing a slowdown in construction of apartments at this point. And whether that morphs into more single-family homes, we'll just have to wait and see. But there is kind of a natural slowing down of this effect as you replace out HVAC and lighting, particularly in the commercial sector. So my sense is the rate of decline would slow to zero eventually. It will approach a limit as inefficient equipment is replaced with efficient equipment. And then your profile of growth really goes to two things. One is adding more customers and the other really goes to things that relate to electrification. Whether that's electric transportation or whether it's feeding the digital economy, I think there's lots of reasons why we should expect organic growth of electricity to be reasonably resilient going forward once we account for energy efficiency. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I think another driver, Paul, would be the fact that bonus \u2013 remember, 50% bonus was passed at the end of 2015 and companies are seeing low interest rates. They're using bonus. The payback on these kinds of improvements get to be pretty quick and so that may be driving some of it in the near term. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So bonus is \u2013 has acted to accelerate the swap-out? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, that's a theory. Whether they're actually doing that or not, I'd just say that it certainly would be a piece of low-hanging fruit. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And just to contrast with my earlier comments about tax benefits like that impacting capital decisions, Art's right. Bonus and those kinds of things typically impact short-term flexible investment decisions, discretionary capital as opposed to long-term committed capital that we would incur with a plant or a transmission line. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Big Dan, how are you? Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Good. How about you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : So, have a couple questions; first around Vogtle. The CapEx schedule that you lay out on slide 17 for new generation there, does that reflect the updated schedule you got from Westinghouse or did you not have time to reflect that yet? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: No, no change for that yet. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Remember, we're still reviewing what they're doing and it's going to be a month and a half or so before we kind of get to the bottom of what they're suggesting right now. So there is a lot of uncertainty with respect to their schedule right now in terms of our agreement to it. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. I assumed that, but I just wanted to verify that that was the case. In terms of Units 3 and 4, I was wondering if you could let us know what the current critical path items are for each of those units. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, still the critical path goes through the nuclear island, so on Unit 3, we are now morphing beyond just concrete and rebar. And we're moving into installation of equipment. We installed the reactor vessel. I guess in the near term on Unit 3, we're looking at steam generator installation, at least the first of two. We'll begin the reactor coolant piping. And then I guess a little later this year, we'll get the second steam generator in and then the initial energization of Unit 3 site is a big deal and that should be on the horizon as well. Unit 4, we're still putting module walls into the reactor vessel of Unit 4. They're still pouring concrete in certain areas and setting those last modules inside the containment vessels or containment buildings so that that's just part of the process of where they are, and I think Tom showed you the productivity of that unit compared to Unit 3. So we're well along our way in Unit 4. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Are there any of those key components that have yet to be delivered on site or do you still have some that are being fabricated off site? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: No. No, no, no. Everything is on site as part of \u2013 as well as I'm aware and I believe it's just getting concrete to a certain level and making sure that you're doing things in an orderly manner to support the new placements. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. One other issue I was wondering about is I know SCANA in one of their filings mentioned a concern they had with the ITAAC submittal process and the amount of support they were getting from Westinghouse related to the timeliness of that. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. I mean, we love our brothers and sisters in SCANA. I would argue that our perspective on that is a wee bit different. We have led the charge in working cooperatively with the NRC to put in place something called UIN, Uncompleted ITAAC Notices. If you can imagine what an ITAAC is, it's a checkout of a system in the plant. And what we've done is essentially when you finish a system like in your house, the HVAC, you'd submit it, the test and the test results, so it's the process of the test and the result of the test and it would be checked off as completed. We saw \u2013 this is some years ago in ICU, (79:33) this is one of our big risk factors. We saw a bow wave, if you will, of these ITAACs going forward. And so, what we did was worked with the NRC to develop this UIN, Uncompleted ITAAC Notice procedure, where we will essentially outline and get the NRC to agree to the process, leaving a blank for the ultimate result of the test. Now, what that does is take an enormous amount of review off the forward calendar and puts it right here, so that when we get the test, fill in the blank, boom, check the box and move forward. The other thing that we have been working on lately is consolidating some of the ITAAC. So what's the number, 892 or 75 per unit? We think we have a way forward to knock off 200 of those per unit, just by consolidating some things that otherwise look duplicative. So I think we've made a lot of headway there. If you go back and listen to what I've said now in these past few earnings calls, if ITAAC is one risk factor and productivity is the other, I would put the productivity risk factor at this point as much more important than the ITAAC risk factor. Still bears watching; we're still all over it. I would just pay more attention to productivity than ITAACs at this point. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Good. Then the last thing I wondered is, if you could just give us a feel for on your financing for 2017 that you have on page... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes, I believe there's a slide in the appendix, Dan, that outlines our 2017 financing plan. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Yeah. Just wondering, though, for those numbers, are those pretty much spread throughout the year for the various units or if it's some more front loaded or back loaded? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I don't have the schedule in front of me, but we can get that information to you. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. That's all I had, thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Dan, always good to talk with you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question coming from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello again. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, just one last question. With the liquidated damages being triggered by nuclear fueling at the end of the year for 2018 for Unit 3, 2019 for Unit 4, has the proposed delay from Westinghouse, do they exceed that? Is this something that's going to be negotiated as you review whether to accept or reject the changes that they've proposed? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I suppose you could negotiate anything, but right now, that schedule would trigger liquidated damages. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: It would. Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: If you believe that schedule, sure. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. I just wanted to make sure about that. All right. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We've made no contract amendments at all. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. And then liquidated damages was specifically applied to the owners' cost, right, the $6 million a month plus $30 million of financing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, it's just one way to think about it. It's not applied to anything; it's just cash to us. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just in general, okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Thanks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question coming from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Ashar. Great to hear from you. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Hi, how are you doing? I just wanted to \u2013 one thing that was written in the 10-K, if I can just read it out and if you can just help me a little bit on the definition of one of the words. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, please do, yeah. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Mississippi Power has evaluated various scenarios in connection with its process to prepare the 2017 rate case. And Southern Company and Mississippi Power have recognized an additional $80 million charged to income, which is estimated minimum probable amount of the $3.31 billion of Kemper IGC costs not currently in rates. That would be recovered under the probable rate mitigation plan to be filed on June 3, 2017. Tom, can you tell me \u2013 I don't know, can you guide us a little bit? What is this minimum? Is it 10% or 15%? I was trying to get a better sense of this minimum language that you used, which corresponds to this $80 million write-off. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me tag team it. The first thing is let me make sure you get the context right. So the traditional rate plan is something that we will file. The rate mitigation plan is designed for us to hit as precisely as we can the revenue requirements that were contemplated under the original certificate. And I've said it to you all before, not only does the rate mitigation plan give us the economics that the Commission thought they were getting when they certificated the plant, they will have a plant that operates under this original certificate, so that's kind of the big picture. Part of that rate mitigation plan assumed essentially not asking for recovery of depreciation, amortization on the 15% uncovered portion of the plant. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's correct. Ashar, you'll remember the plant was certified at a 100% level to be entered into agreement to sell 15% of it. That was undone since, but the rate mitigation plan that we will file basically does what Tom outlined, it recognizes that we won't charge Mississippi for the depreciation/amortization of the 15% of the asset for five years. And that's what the $80 million represents. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Okay. Thank you so much. That clarifies it. Thank you so much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Always great having you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.: Just want to say this. I know we have Vogtle and we have Kemper, but if you kind of look past these headline items, we're at a really important point here, so we tried to stress in our October presentation. You think about our earnings that we're forecasting forward as we said in October, $290 million to $302 million with a midpoint of $296 million, when you look at the operating companies that are state-regulated, something like $278 million of earnings of the $296 million are coming from those entities. And that does not account for the long-term contracted bilateral contract that has served us so well for so long and have a risk profile similar to those state-regulated entities. I think from a risk-return standpoint and therefore a value accretion standpoint, Southern Company has lengthened, strengthened and improved its value position going forward. We'll get Kemper started up. We'll go through the regulatory process. We'll continue to make progress on Vogtle. And I think from an investor's standpoint, we're as good as we've been in many, many years. We appreciate your attention today and we look forward to talking with you soon. Take care. Operator, that's all I have. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Carlos, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Wednesday, May 3, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Carlos. Welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Each of our major business units had a great start to the year. Despite headwinds from unseasonably warm weather during the first two months of the year, our traditional electric and gas operating companies performed well and they are on track to deliver on their targets for 2017 and beyond. Southern Company Gas, including its seven premier state-regulated gas utilities, performed exactly as expected. Art will update you on our financial results in just a minute, but I'd like to first provide brief updates on the status of the Vogtle and Kemper projects. First, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As you know, Westinghouse, the primary contractor for the Vogtle expansion, declared bankruptcy on March 29. Georgia Power and the co-owners of Vogtle were well prepared for this event. The owners immediately entered into a 30-day interim agreement, which was, as announced last week, extended through May 12. The Interim Assessment Agreement allows work to continue and maintains momentum on the site while we develop comprehensive schedule and cost assessments for the project. Thanks to the Interim Assessment Agreement and close coordination between Georgia Power, the co-owners, Southern Nuclear, Westinghouse and Fluor, approximately 6,000 workers have remained on site, safely completing multiple concrete placements and other work within the two nuclear islands in the balance of the plant. In fact, we've seen meaningful improvements in productivity since our last earnings call in late February. Currently, we are working on an agreement with Westinghouse that will allow work to continue even if current EPC agreement is rejected as a part of the bankruptcy proceeding. Westinghouse has indicated its intention to reject the EPC contract. The limitations on Westinghouse's execution of the project imposed by the bankruptcy creates uncertainties that are not good for the project, especially over an extended period of time. If Westinghouse is not committed to perform under the EPC contract, Southern Nuclear is well positioned to manage the site. The agreement we are negotiating is intended to ensure a smooth transition and continued access to Westinghouse resources. This should put us in the best possible position, whether the ultimate decision is to complete the project or not. Separately, we are seeking to add structure to Toshiba's payment obligations under the $3.68 billion parent company guarantee. Ultimately, Georgia Power's objective is to be positioned with sufficient information to make a fully informed recommendation to its regulators within the next month or two. It is possible that we will need more time to ensure that we have the best information possible and to reach consensus with the co-owners regarding the best path forward for customers and all other stakeholders. More importantly, the conclusion of our assessment and development of a recommendation will merely begin a regulatory process that does not yet have a definitive timeframe. An important consideration as we move forward will be ensuring that the regulatory recovery framework for the project continues to support the financial integrity and strong credit ratings of Georgia Power. Now let's turn to an update on the Kemper County project. Over the past two months, Mississippi Power has continued its efforts to improve gasification reliability as we work towards reaching sustained operations using both gasifiers in the production of electricity. As we discussed earlier this week, the ongoing challenges with various systems had led to extending the estimated in-service date to the end of May. Mississippi Power expects to file its Kemper rate case with the Mississippi PSC by the June 3 deadline. In connection with this filing, Mississippi Power expects to request an accounting order to defer all costs incurred after in-service that cannot be capitalized, are not subject to the cost cap and are not already included in rates. As a reminder, Mississippi Power's current strategy is to file both a traditional rate case and an alternative multi-year rate mitigation plan as provided for under Mississippi law. A negotiated settlement with interested parties that would be subject to PSC approval is an acceptable outcome. We don't want to get ahead of that process on today's call. Our goal remains to achieve an outcome that balances the interests of customers and other stakeholders. I'll turn the call now over to Art for a financial and economic overview. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2017, reporting earnings of $658 million or $0.66 per share compared with earnings of $489 million or $0.53 per share in the first quarter of last year. First quarter results for 2017 include after-tax charges of $67 million related to increased cost estimates for work at Mississippi Power's Kemper County integrated gasification combined cycle project. First quarter results for 2016 included after-tax charges of $33 million for the Kemper Project. First quarter results for 2017 also include after-tax charges of $20 million associated with Plant Scherer Unit 3 as a part of Gulf Power rate case settlement, approved by the Florida PSC. This settlement resulted in Gulf Power's remaining $240 million investment in Plant Scherer being placed into retail rate base. Additionally, the settlement provided for an increase in the equity ratio from 46% to 52.5% while preserving the 9.25% to 11.25% allowed ROE range. Overall, it was a very constructive result. Excluding these and adjusting for other items described in our earnings materials, Southern Company earned $652 million or $0.66 per share during the first quarter of 2017 compared to $536 million or $0.58 per share in the first quarter of 2016. The major earnings drivers year-over-year for the first quarter of 2017 included results for Southern Company Gas and improved performance at Southern Power, offset by increased shares and interest expense. Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Collectively, the economies of Southern Company's regulated electric and gas markets continued to enjoy increased population and employment growth in the first quarter of 2017. While consumer spending is tepid, measures of consumer confidence are at record high. Similarly, leading indicators of industrial activity are improving and suggest that the U.S. economy should continue to expand in the first half of 2017 with real GDP projected at 2.4% for the year. The ISM Manufacturer's Index remains in a solid expansion mode at 54.8 in April. The increase in this index mirrors the jump in consumer confidence seen since the election last November and bodes well for improving industrial sales throughout the year. Year-over-year, weather-normal retail electric sales in the first quarter of 2017 were down 1.1%. Customer growth remained strong in both our regulated electric and gas markets. We added 13,500 new electric customers on the residential side and 7,500 new residential gas customers in the first quarter of 2017. This strong growth was offset by expected declines in use per customer in our electric, residential and commercial classes, driven by energy efficiency and increase in multifamily housing, e-commerce and the closing of brick-and-mortar retail store. Overall, we continue to believe our forecast of retail electric sales growth in 2017 of 0% to 0.5% is achievable. Before turning the call back to Tom, I want to provide our earnings estimate for the second quarter and share a brief reminder on our financing plans for this year. First, we estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Second, our various equity plans continue to operate throughout the first four months of this year and our current plans are to continue issuing new shares consistent with the outlook we've provided at our Analyst Day. We remain steadfastly committed to the financial integrity of Southern Company and our major subsidiaries. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Art. Following an eventful 2016, Southern Company has entered 2017 with strong momentum. Our franchise businesses performed at a high level, solidifying our position as an industry leader as our customer-focused business model continues to serve us well. Finally, I'd like to highlight that our Board of Directors recently approved an $0.08 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.32 per share. This is our 16th consecutive annual increase and for 69 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company's paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. But more importantly, the Board's decision to increase the rate of growth of the dividend speaks to the resilience of our long-term plan, which is underpinned by a firm foundation of premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities. Moreover, it supports our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long term. In conclusion, we believe Southern Company is well positioned for continued success in 2017 and for years to come. Now, 32,000 employees strong, we remain committed to providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve. We're now ready to take your questions. Operator, we'll now take the first question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Good afternoon. So if I'm thinking about the timeline here, you have the next month or two, to make a what you consider a fully informed decision, get all the stakeholders involved. And at that juncture, you'll then proceed with the dialogue with the Georgia PSC, is that right? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. You should view our relationship with the staff. You know, they have independent monitors. They're commissioned. It's kind of real-time, so it's continuous, not discrete. The notion of the 1.5 months or 2 months or whatever it is, is really this idea of getting consensus among us, our co-owners, our Board and the Commission staff as to how to proceed. Based on what our assessment is at that point, we will work constructively as we have, gosh, since, I don't know, 1992 or so, to develop a constructive approach. The reason why we're kind of vague as to what that approach is, it may change based on what our recommendation to the Commission is. So until we kind of get a better feeling within this next month or two, we really won't have very much to say about what the continuing process of the Commission will be and what timeframe it will occur over. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Understood. I'm just trying to get a sense of the milestones, Tom. And so at some point, there'll be a path that you've decided to... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Recommend. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : ...go down which you're going to file with the Commission or a menu of paths. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's it. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : That you want to potentially go down, with you filing with the Commission in a formal proceeding, correct or incorrect? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, that's right and I was just picking on a couple of words, you said a decision before. This is going to be a collaborative dialogue, I think, between the co-owners, us and the Commission about how to proceed. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay, and then \u2013 but you will continue, and I may be presuming incorrectly. It sounds like you will continue to build the plants, continue to keep construction moving forward until you get to an end of that process. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's exactly right. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Because you may continue to build all the units. You may continue to build one unit. You may continue to build no units, but until you know the path you're taking, you'll continue to construct as on the front schedule? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Because that preserves the option. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's exactly right. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Well, my last question, because I'm sure you've got a ton. You have the $920 million letters of credit that were posted. Have you requested from the banks to pull down on those letters of credit and at this juncture, have you actually received any cash as a result of those requests to draw down on the letters of credit? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Greg, there is a process under which you propose to draw under those letters, and we're following that process to the letter. So as of today, we've not drawn on those LCs, but we're following the process. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : But you've requested to draw, but you've not yet received. Is that what you're saying? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: There's a period in which you provide a notice to draw. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So, you've provided that notice? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks, Tom. Sorry to be a stickler. Take care. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, no problem. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. On the Vogtle subject, I noticed in the 10-Q, there's a number of aggregate liability under the Interim Assessment Agreement of $470 million, of which your share is $215 million. Is that a current, like through right today number, or is it \u2013 because it also says that $245 million was paid or accrued at the end of March. Just trying to get a sense of the pace at which that number's increasing during this period. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So that would be an assessment as to the first 30-day period plus any liens that have been placed on the property in order to clear the liens, so we can continue to progress the work. It really represents kind of how much we've spent. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But it seems to imply couple of hundred million a month is sort of the spending rate. Is that about right? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It's a decent guess, yeah. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just on the other, I mean obviously you made the disclosure as well this morning that your current assessment is that the cost to finish the plant would exceed the value of the parent guarantee. Can you give us any more sort of indication of by how much or is that a close-to-call currently or how do we think about that in the...? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, but I wouldn't view that as a conclusion at this point. Let us do our work and we'll figure out kind of what we believe the hours remaining to complete, the costs remaining to complete. And certainly along the way, we will evaluate the $3.7 billion in round numbers guarantee and what remains, and whether that all looks like a good deal for our co-owners and certainly for our customers and we'll be \u2013 I can assure you in ongoing dialogue with the Commission about that. So let us continue to progress over the next 30 to 60 days and we'll figure it out. And certainly, we'll absolutely use the LCs to offset damages we've incurred and will incur going forward. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But you're not \u2013 it is that you have disclosed though that you already think it's more than the guarantee, right? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It might be, that's a possibility and we'll just assess it when we get to the end. We're not in a position to say what that amount is. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I get it. And then can I just quickly on Kemper, if the plant hasn't entered service by the June date for filing, do you still file? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Anthony. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : How are you doing, Tom? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Super. How are you? Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Another day in sell-side paradise. In the Q, it stated that I guess the owners of Vogtle do not believe the revised in-service dates are achievable. If, I guess, we think of a best case option through this interim period, what do you think your new in-service dates are? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We really haven't reached that conclusion, that's the whole point. So if you recall the process from back, I guess, earlier this year, it was that we were going to review all the documentation and all the schedule and all the cost information associated with that schedule. And then along the way, before we complete that, Westinghouse files bankruptcy. Now as part of our agreement in working through the bankruptcy, Westinghouse has completely opened their books to our valuation of time and costs remaining to complete, that's what we're in right now. So it's almost as if we're in one track and now we're in another track of evaluation because now, we can't rely on them. We have to look at an option other than Westinghouse finishing here. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : What \u2013 if we think about it, is the option of a fixed-price contract, the next stage of Vogtle even likely? Or should we all be thinking that the type of contract to finish this project is going to be more of a, like a cost-plus type contract? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It could take a variety of different forms. Certainly, we could find a third party to kind of give you a fixed-price. That would be most likely a Fluor, Bechtel kind of thing. We could certainly take over the project ourselves and act as general contractor. And all this really has to do with what we think is the best way to most economically complete the plant and in concert with our regulator, an equitable kind of division of risk and return as to how we intend to proceed. So all of that is part of an ongoing discussion. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : And just lastly, do you get that feeling at all that Westinghouse, even through this bankruptcy, would like to continue on the project, or there's no sense in that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I think, they pretty well signaled the reason they went into bankruptcy was to insulate themselves and so we'll see. As we said I think in the comments, in the script that we believe their intent is to reject the contract. They'll do that once we conclude these interim agreements. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. And hey, Anthony, let me just be very clear what we're referring to, you and I were both referring to there, were their obligations as a general contractor in the construction. They still have the obligations to play ball on things like intellectual property and whatever else they're going to do to finish the plant. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Bud. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Wanted to discuss the Department of Energy and approaches that the DOE could take in support of Vogtle. What sort of the range of possible options and the range of types of support that we could potentially see? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. And let me just be \u2013 I'm going to be a wee bit coy here, because there's lots of conversation going on. Let me first say that the most obvious thing the United States government can do is to lend support to extend the in-service or the timeframe on the production tax credits. My assessment is, they are absolutely willing to do that. This is an issue that is bigger, I think, at the United States government level, certainly bigger than Vogtle and Summer. This is a national security issue and it follows on the heels of what, by all accounts, is a very successful visit with Abe and Trump, and recall that as a result of those successful meetings, I guess the Prime Minister and the President instructed Deputy Prime Minister As\u014d, along with Vice President Pence to set up essentially a commission, an effort to evaluate lengthening and strengthening the kind of infrastructure investment opportunities that we could collaborate on between our two great nations. There were three segments of activity. One of those segments was energy infrastructure and then some weeks following that, we have a bankruptcy in Westinghouse. And so I think this is something that has taken the attention of our elected officials. I would assess the support of the Trump administration and the relevant Cabinet officers as A-plus. They had given us all kinds of support and we have constructive dialogues underway with them ongoing. Likewise, in Congress. I think we have tremendous support because I said before, this is bigger than Vogtle and Summer. This is a national security issue. If the United States wants nuclear in its portfolio for the future, we've got to figure out a way to be successful here. I'd rather kind of leave it there, if you don't mind, Stephen, rather than go through and explore specific options. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very much appreciate that given where we are. We'll wait for the.... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Thanks. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: ...study outcome and recommendations. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, sir. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: If I could shift gears over to just philosophically, thinking about how you think about the risk of further cost overruns and the regulatory treatment for that, assuming again that you decide to continue to move forward, are there certain sort of philosophical guideposts that you would want to secure in terms of how you think about addressing and sort of allocating for that (27:21) further overruns? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, right now, I mean, we have an agreement that was entered into in 2016 that essentially doesn't have a cost cap. So theoretically, one approach is that we could live with the prudent stipulation; that addresses return levels during construction. And then following construction, presumably, the amounts of capital will revert back to GPC base rates. And even when you think about Georgia law, it really has been very consistent over the years and this is now decades for the recovery of all reasonably and prudently incurred costs for a certified IRP resource, regardless of the original certified cost and let me also remind you of the math, when this thing was originally certified, the amount of price increase we thought we would have would be about 12%. Now we estimate it will be in the 6s to 8%. So we feel that we have at least the structure to begin a dialogue. Certainly as we have to make a recommendation. Once Westinghouse decides to reject the contract, which they'd given us every intent of doing so, then we, Georgia Power and the co-owners have to make a recommendation as to whether to proceed or to recommend not completing the plant. We have structures available for both of those. Certainly, it's a different risk posture and that will be part of the conversation with the Commission. And certainly, all of this, as we have in the past and we've demonstrated it over with Mississippi and others, Southern Company has always been committed to supporting the ratings of our subsidiaries and I think we've shown our hand and that we are faithful in that resolution. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Tom. Thank you for taking my questions. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Turning to Mississippi. If I read the detail in your SEC filings correctly, you've got $25 million per month or so of costs, including the depreciation that are not in rates once the plant goes online and that doesn't necessarily include a return on capital of the plant, the PP&E that's not in rate base or that's not in customer rate. So $25 million, 12 months, that's $300 million a year, plus the return on capital of, pick a number, but it's not a small one. On a utility this size, that's a pretty big rate increase. Are you having conversations in Mississippi with the legislature, the governor or others about potentially expanding the use of things like securitization, which I think you need a legal change to do to be able to mitigate some of that rate impact? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, look. I think we've said this in the past, but remember what we said in the script here is that we're going to file traditional rate case and then we had, as provided by law, a rate mitigation plan, the notion of the rate mitigation plan is to essentially put in place revenue requirements that are similar to the revenue requirements associated with the original order. So if we provide the plant and the plant is operational consistent with the original owner, and we have revenue requirements that are similar to the original owner, that's kind of a way to approach. Of course, there are a host of other opportunities that we can engage in beyond those two things, and that's really what we were pointing to when we started talking in the script about the settlement conversation as an acceptable outcome. So rest assured that we're working constructively, being very mindful of the total rate impact in Mississippi's customers and the way, the best way to structure a regulatory outcome that meets everybody's needs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Are other folks within the state outside it, meaning are other legislative or folks in the governor's office involved in this process? And do you need legislation to implement some of the things that might come across the table in these talks? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: In terms of need, probably not, but we don't want to, again, get ahead of the process that we're going to be following through here as we approach any court settlement or as we approach the filing. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. One or two for Art, and these are just kind of housekeeping types. Southern Power recognized a pretty big benefit \u2013 tax benefit in the quarter, a little over $50 million, just curious what is in your guidance for the tax benefit at Southern Power this full year? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Are you referring to production tax credits and investment tax credits or? Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm looking at the whole kit, kat and caboodle. I'm looking at Southern Power's income statement in your Q. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: In the Q. Okay. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Sir. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Let me address that first. There was a couple of timing things that went on in the first quarter. One of them related to the manner in which we recognize PTCs. When we gave our estimate for the quarter, it was $0.57. We assume that we would recognize production tax credits under a earnings before tax perspective for Southern Power. We actually changed that methodology during the quarter and went to an as-production basis. So we recognized more income at Southern Power related to production tax credits in the first quarter, but we merely accelerated them out of the second and third quarter and you'll see that flip back around during the year. So we don't expect that to occur throughout the year and it won't have an impact on income. For the entire year, it's all based into our guidance. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, so your guidance, I'm just trying to think about how much renewable tax-related items is embedded within your full-year guidance. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Okay, so $53 million of one-time of those PTCs, ITCs and $178 million of ongoing PTCs. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And I think it's interesting to point out that when you look at the one-time events as compared to 2016 and 2017, something like, 50%, what was it, 51%, something like that were one-time events and 2016 and 2017, it's down to about what, 17% or something? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes, I think quarter, for the year, between PTCs and ITCs, we'll end up with $16 million less in total year-over-year. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, and last question... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: What you're losing on ITCs, you're picking up on PTCs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right. It seems pretty flattish year-over-year. And one last one, also a housekeeping one. At Southern Gas, if I \u2013 and I know you didn't own it in the first quarter of last year. But if I were to back out the mark-to-market in both periods, how significant of a change was net income at Southern Gas and what were the biggest drivers? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes, hold on just a sec. It was pretty flattish. You look at four distinct segments, the Gas Distribution operations was pretty flat. Gas Marketing Services was down a little, maybe $9 million in net income. Midstream Operations were bigger, mostly due to Southern Natural Gas being added and the other, there was some other mishmash of some couple million, so $13 million year-over-year increase. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And that fell within what you expected even after you considered things like rate base growth and O&M synergies, those type of items? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Every thing's in, yes. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It was amazing. It hit it exactly on the nose for the Fluor, what we expected and that's after backing out a really big positive in Sequent, which we will regularly do. We will not include Sequent as our ongoing earnings. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey, how are you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: My first question is if you were to go the abandonment route, is it reasonable for us to assume that it seems like through March of 2017, the total Vogtle investment is $5.4 billion including financing? Is that sort of a reasonable starting point in terms of a number to assume? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then I think the Georgia legislation provides for recovery of your investment plus a return. In a proceeding to determine what that return would be, would that be the Georgia Public Service Commission who would decide that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, and the law provides for all prudently incurred costs. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And I guess the other question that I have is, it looks as if the banks financing Westinghouse took a collateral interest in the intellectual property or the, I guess, it's the EPC plan. How does that affect your situation if you decide to continue with construction? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, man, so that's exactly this filing that we've made with the bankruptcy court. Potentially, the debt financing wanted to have essentially access to everything. However, the funds used in the debt financing only applied to the so-called GoodCo , which is kind of the nuclear fuel processing business, their services business, O&M, decommissioning and others and don't flow to the benefit of our project. And so we don't believe they should have lien rights on the IP or anything to do with our project. And frankly the Creditors Committee agrees with our position. There will be a hearing on that on May 10, but I think we're on pretty firm ground there. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: And then it would be up to the bankruptcy judge to decide how to resolve that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. It would be odd for the debt financing to only apply to some of Westinghouse and not others, and then to get the benefit of \u2013 and then to get the benefit of all of the security potential to the debt financing. So it seems like an awfully logical position here. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Hey, let me just make sure that we clarify something. I think it was Michael \u2013 it was Paul that raised the issue. In the scenario for abandonment, the only amount at risk for the abandonment charge is $4.1 billion, not $5.4 billion. The delta is the financing cost, and that's already under recovery. So just want to make sure everybody understands that. Math was right, $5.4 billion, but the amount at risk for recovery under the abandonment scenario was $4.1 billion. Okay? Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Welcome. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Go ahead. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So most of my questions have been answered, but just wanted to clarify on a couple of points, coming back to Vogtle. If you don't find \u2013 if Westinghouse steps out and you don't find anybody who's willing to accept a fixed price contract and so Southern steps in to complete the project. Is there any sense of what that \u2013 how much overrun, firstly, that could entail given Southern's going to do it? And secondly, what does that actually mean operationally? Are you hiring all the people? Like, what will that actually mean practically to kind of complete that project by Southern itself? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Sure, okay. So let's kind of take it step-by-step. There's already been a tremendous amount of work that's been complete on the site. And then what you have to do is evaluate what is left, okay? So that would be time to complete, cost to complete. It is our intention that absent any kind of smaller changes in management, that the people that we need are already present on-site. We've been able to do that with these interim agreements to keep people working, and that's really important. So we evaluate what's been spent, we evaluate what needs to be spent. Recall, we have the Toshiba Guarantee, so that would be round numbers again, $3.7 billion, that would offset those future payments. So then, we would evaluate if there was \u2013 if that was sufficient or if there was anything in excess even of the $3.7 billion in addition to the normal budgeted costs and we'll evaluate that in terms of schedule and potential costs within the construct of whatever our co-owners need and what we need via our regulatory regime at Georgia. Recall also that I think we've got a great deal of flexibility in how we think about this. You must realize that Southern is pretty well unique in being able to fulfill these kinds of obligations. We have been involved uniquely in the supply chain efforts throughout the project. We have been involved uniquely in terms of the scope of presence on our site. I think we have roughly 400 people that have been engaged in oversight work even with Westinghouse and with Fluor. And now, we have provided for, as we started to see Westinghouse get under duress, a transition plan even before Westinghouse has filed bankruptcy. So we have a transition plan in place. The people are turned on. They're on-site. We won't have to go grab bodies if in fact, that's the course that we decide to take. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I think it's important to add that we've got stepping rights to all the subcontracts, so we choose to do so, we can step in and contract with Fluor and any other subcontractor that has a primary contract with Westinghouse at this time. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's very helpful color. And just quickly on the $3.7 billion parent guarantee, that \u2013 there is no risk to it at this point as I understand. The only risk being if Toshiba files for bankruptcy, then you become just unsecured creditor, but apart from that, there isn't any other risk, is that correct? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, I mean, we're trying to be very rigorous in our approach here for all these things. When we think about the guarantee, we don't want to get into a position where there's an argument about the amount We don't want to get into a position whether that amount is available, whether we finish or don't finish the plant if Westinghouse rejects it and then we're in that position. We don't want to get into a position of arguing how the draws under the guarantee might be available and we want to have some assurance as to the security of those draws. So we're working through a lot of issues there. Likewise, with Westinghouse, I never want to get into a position, look at them; they're in bankruptcy of relying on Westinghouse's efforts. I want to have clear, commercial agreements set forth for the IP that currently is under development and you know all the IP is not finished. There's some related to instrumentation and control that is currently under development. That's not a surprise to anybody, but we want to make sure that there is a commercial obligation for Westinghouse to finish that IP, to make available the skills and resources necessary to carry it forward. Also, you should note too that there will always kind of be, along the way, some opportunity to change the intellectual property as design changes are manifested on the site. Further, you should know that this notion of transition is a critically important issue. It sounds like a detail, but getting all the clearances, getting the transfer of contract, the transfer of personnel, et cetera. We want to be very clear about all that, so we're taking a very rigorous approach to all these issues. So these two big issues, the certainty around the structure of the guarantee and certainty as to the commercial relationship we have with Westinghouse, I think, are really important in order for us to even consider moving ahead should Westinghouse ultimately reject the contract. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's really helpful color, so you do expect to continue to update as you have further color on these discussions, I'm assuming. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Oh, absolutely. If there's material information, we'll put it out in an 8-K. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you so much, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Ashar. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Hi, Tom. How are you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Fantastic. I hope, you're well. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : I just \u2013 what I can't understand is you guys, as you are spending on these projects, as we're going through this analysis, right, and you mentioned, you're spending at a run rate of about $200 million or so a month. So I guess by the time the decision takes place, it might be eight to nine months into the year, and that would imply another, I don't know, whether the $200 million was for the whole and your share is $100 million, but could be another $1 billion spent on the project by the time you make the decision. Doesn't that make it \u2013 the real decision is going forward and how to recover the cost, how can you \u2013 I just don't get the chance of abandonment. If there was any chance of abandonment or anything like that, you should have slowed down and not let spend more on the project, because in the end, the customer has to pay for it and it would be really bad for the customer to be given a bill of another $1 billion that you make the decision. So am I missing something? To me, the chances of abandonment are really low. If they were a little bit higher, then you should have slowed down the process and kind of like thought of it and that would kind of indicate the options are more there, or am I thinking through this wrongly? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. No, no, Ashar, you're raising a good point. Let's just kind of walk through it a bit though. As this next 30 to 60 days, we're working with our co-owners and, of course, with our board, and in conjunction with the staff, the independent monitors and the Commission. I think we'll reach a point where we're in a position to start making a recommendation and also as we finish the resolution of these commercial contracts I just talked about. I think then we'll kind of be in a position to say, yeah, I think it looks likely that we're going to recommend going forward. Otherwise, if it looks likely, the best thing for customers is to not complete these plants. I think at that point, you may take a totally different posture on-site. So long as it is viable for us to complete the plant, it is absolutely, I think, important for us to not only maintain, but improve productivity on the site so that the ultimate long-term cost is as attractive as it can be. Were we to start sending people home, the chances of us getting those people back on site would be awfully difficult. The other thing \u2013 hey, the other thing is recall some of these first amounts that we've been talking about were amounts that were already owed, okay, so this is really just fulfilling the contract as it exists. And yeah, I think we said this before, but if we didn't, let me just be very clear that $200 million or so a month, it could be a wee bit less than that, but that's a decent conservative number, is 100%. So Georgia's share of that would be $45.7 million (49:59). Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Okay. That's what I thought. Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Tom. Good afternoon, Tom. It's been a long day. The $3.7 billion, is that inclusive of the $920 million? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And the $3.7 billion is for 100% of the project, both units? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Right. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just switching gears, a big driver in the quarter was O&M. How much of that is sustainable? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Paul, some of that is certainly timing that will be spent later in the year. There were some outages pushed out of the quarter into the second, so you're going to see some of that, but a lot of that is going to be sustained as we move through the year. As you know, the third quarter of each year is our big quarter and will determine how much O&M is spent between then and end of the year. So we still believe that we can hit our targets in light of the under-run on O&M in the first quarter. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: The other thing though that we're doing, Art and I have been kind of pushing it at the Southern Company Management Council level is to approve the growth profile of the operating companies. And one of the things that we're looking at is are there some things that we can do that can maybe do capital investment, technology investment, a variety of other things that will actually improve the reliability, customer service and price of our product, associated with those investments, may be, some permanent reductions in O&M. So we're pushing very hard to make the grid more resilient, to really understand and right-size the amount of investment in our fossil/hydro fleet to automate what otherwise are some administrative processes. I think we have the opportunity to improve the organic growth profile of our operating companies and reduce O&M at the same time. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And is the permanent piece of the O&M, does that push you to one end of guidance, the top end there, or is it just one of the gives and takes that we're seeing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. You know, Paul, we don't even mess with that until the end of the third quarter. We just keep our guidance where it is. What I'm really doing with that initiative though is not worrying about the tactics of where we are within a range in a year, but rather make even more resilient the 5% long-term growth rate that we referred you to. I said before in October, I thought October 16, I know it was hard to knock us off the balance beam. We've been talking hard about resilience and how well-founded, I think, our long-term plan is. And remember I said back then, if you want to really see proof of where our board sees that and where we see it for heaven's sake, is let's watch and see what the board does on the dividend. And sure enough, they increased their growth rate and the dividend as we thought they may this April. I think that was a big vote of confidence in our long-term ability to hit the growth rate. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Understood. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you, guys. So just could you quantify how much the change in accounting for PTCs benefited the quarter versus what you had in your guidance for the quarter? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: About $0.05. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Art. That was it. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Hey, Tom. Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Just a couple technical questions on Vogtle. If it's going to take a month or two, you think, to decide why was the interim assessment only moved to May 12 and not further and why shorter than, let's say, what SCANA did? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I think it's very clear. We're working very hard on these agreements related to the Toshiba Guarantee and related to the ability for us to effectively transition the plant away from Westinghouse, should Westinghouse reject the contract, it is, I think, clear to us that once we reach that point, making the transition at the management on the site is really important as to the effectiveness. So keeping a short leash on the relationship with Toshiba and Westinghouse, and ultimately, should Westinghouse reject the contract, having us take over the site, if that's what we choose to do, in a shorter timeframe is good for the project. Keeping Westinghouse in this kind of limbo role under bankruptcy is not good for the project for any period of time. We want to keep that as short as we can. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That makes sense. Second question is just I know you're kind of keeping the Commission staff apprised. I guess when we ultimately get your decision in a couple, a month or two, whatever it is, how should we think about how much they are onboard with it already or not? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I mean, Steve, you know us. I mean, we've been working with collaboratively with the Commission. I guess we had the original Vogtle decision back in 1992 with the last one there and then in 1995, we reached the agreement on these three-year accounting orders and every three years, we've put in place a series of interesting accounting orders. It seems like every 30 years, we had a unique set of challenges in which to handle. We just have this track record of constructive regulation here in the south. And Georgia has been a tremendous kind of example of how an integrated, regulated system meets the needs of customers. We have the best reliability, prices significantly below national averages, the best customer service. It works. And so our evaluation is we'll be able to work constructively with the Commission to handle these very challenging issues. And I think that with our no-surprises way of working with the Commission, I think when we reach the point of beginning a filing process, I would assume we have a decent degree of consensus around that approach. I would be surprised if we reached that and there were a lot of surprises on either side. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then last question, just on the nuclear PTC, unless something happens quickly in Congress, we're probably not going to have an extension to that prior to you making the decision. Should we just assume that your confidence level is high enough in that that you're going to assume in your analysis that that is going to get extended if needed for delayed dates? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, that's an important variable in all of this and I can tell you that the conversations we've had and it's just going to be broadly across government, whether it's Congress or the administration, have been very constructive and supportive. They understand that this is kind of bigger than Vogtle. This is a national security issue and that frankly, the cost of extending this timeframe is almost nothing as they scored in Congress. So we've experienced a tremendous amount of support. We could come up with a variety of ways to evidence that support, but I'm just going to assure you that as we reach the end of our deliberations and make a recommendation, this will be central to that recommendation. And if we decide to go forward, it would be because we believe, and we may have evidence at that time of our belief that we'll be able to manage it. There may be ways we can demonstrate their support even without the law or the tax reform building path is my point. Hello, Steve? Operator? Operator : His line is still open, sir. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Okay. Steve, you still there? I don't know what happened. Operator, you want to go to the next question? Steve, I hope that answered your question. Certainly if it doesn't, call us back. Sorry you got cut off. Operator, you want to go to the next question? Operator : Yes, Sir. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Ali. How are you? Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good, thanks, Tom. Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question, Art, I may have missed this, but if I were to bridge the gap in the first quarter between your $0.57 original guidance and the $0.66 you reported, was that all coming from that change in accounting for the tax or what's causing that $0.09 delta? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: No, I think what you're seeing is a lot of it was from the PTC recognition of Southern Power. The vast majority of that, $0.05, the other $0.04 really came by better O&M management across the fronts of all operating companies to do a little better than what we had buried into our $0.57 estimate. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see, got it. And then, Tom, on Kemper, do you see at all any scenario in which the plant ultimately just ends up being a CCGT? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So I mean, the way you asked that question, sure, I mean there's that possibility, but that's going to be taking into account the deliberations in the state of Mississippi. Recall the nine cell (1:00:58) kind of red, green diagram they use in order to assess the viability of the plant, still under high gas scenarios, we still get green cells in there. And certainly, it remains a hedge. And along the way, as we have built into the technology the ability to operate under dual fuels, we've been able to demonstrate the ability to deliver whatever energy is the cheapest. So there is a possibility you could do that, we'll just have to see. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Would that be part of sort of the rate case and prudency review or will that be outside of that scope? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, it's all part of the conversation. So the conversation is kind of underway and we don't want to ever get in front of that conversation. So Ali, whenever you ask a question, is it possible, there's a lot of stuff that's possible. Let the process run and we'll give you illumination when we get it. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, and then a different topic. As you pointed out, electric sales, weather-normalized, were negative 1% this quarter. In fact, if I'm right; I think that's the fourth consecutive quarter we've seen negative weather-normalized sales. I'm just wondering how you square that with the economic growth profile that you're seeing out there and how should we think about that going forward. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. Ali, we got a couple things going on in both commercial and industrial classes. We began to see a reduction in use per customer in the commercial class in the second quarter of last year, if you go back and look at our history. And so when you're looking at the first quarter year-over-year, that trend continues in 2017, but it wasn't in 2016. So you still have the effect of that showing up. And in the industrial market, it was kind of the same thing. We had some industrial customers who had announced that they were shuddering portions of their process or operating processes, mid-year, last year, that were in process for the first quarter of last year. So year-over-year, you're going to see some effects of that as well. More importantly, I think if you look at our sales compared on a weather-normal basis compared to what we estimated they would be, we were only down 4.3%. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, and let me throw in the other stuff, you probably heard this. But leap year, February of 2016 as compared to February 2017, that matters in the numbers. The other thing, and our numbers have been very consistent with what I'm seeing in my work at the Fed, and I said this on Squawk Box this morning, but January was kind of a bad month. February was an awful month year-over-year in comparison. But then, holy smokes, March, especially the end of March, turned around and I would do not only a year-over-year comparison, but a momentum comparison. The momentum comparison for March as compared to the quarter showed that of the 10 largest industrial sectors, in March, nine of them were positive and one of them was reasonably flat. So it's fascinating to me that we saw a big turn. The Fed saw that also for the nation. So very, very fascinating stuff. We're a little bit stronger than the rest of the nation in terms of our economic growth, job creation, 1.9% versus 1.5%. Listen, I think there is reason for us to hang with our annual projection of between 0% and 0.5% growth this year. Let's see what happens on the sustainability of that March performance. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And last question. Tom, if I recall, in your legacy regulated business, when we looked at the long-term growth, the expectation was that at the back half of the decade, environmental CapEx would likely pick up and drive rate base and earnings. That probably won't materialize currently in this scenario. What takes the place of that? What can you use to offset that growth in the future? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Sure, man, absolutely. In fact, boy, I remember showing this to my board almost day one I got on, and everything else. But we went through a period there where we were kind of at the end of David Radcliffe's timeframe. For a while there, I was CFO and then Paul Bowers took over I went over to COO where we were talking about really healthy EPS growth rates. That's where we were spending capital like crazy as compared to a rather modest net committed capital base. And so our earnings per share growth rate was going off the charts. And then as we started winding down on a lot of environmental construction, as I took over, and then as we saw the riskiness of Kemper and Vogtle at one time, our long-term growth rate got real flat. And I started saying that to you all and started saying that well, it may flatten out through the last half of the decade, but as you remember correctly, it should turn back up with environmental CapEx and then with new capital associated with new generation coming back in. What we were able to do in 2016 was execute on a growth strategy. You may remember too, I had been talking for some time about the wisdom of natural gas infrastructure and getting ahead of natural gas being a primary source of fuel for the future, a bridge, if you will, between now and 2050. And we recognized early on in our strategy deliberations here under my tenure that I get gas, but boy, you know what, the gas resource isn't where the load is. And so there needs to be a new rethinking of natural gas infrastructure. And that's where we started pursuing ideas that ultimately became realized with Southern Company Gas. That is AGL Resources and the Kinder Morgan, 50% of the Southern Natural Gas pipeline. And now, we're adding to that a little bit. So the last thing is just a tiny little thing, but PowerSecure is really an option for the future. It doesn't add meaningfully to earnings in the near term. But Ali, if you think about it, we have added to our growth rate, as I suggested, we drop down to, I forget where we were, 3% to 4%. And then when we went to AGL, it became 4% to 5%. And then when we added on the rest of Sonat plus everything else plus Southern Power, man, we jumped all the way up to 5%. And what we've been able to demonstrate, I think, is the resilience of that 5%. In other words, we stress-tested that against a variety of scenarios and really put it through some tail risk and we believe our 5% long-term growth rate is, in fact, resilient against a variety of outcomes. So we're very happy with that. And I think frankly, we've accomplished through those series of transactions and through the strategy we play, and now for the future, what I'm suggesting is there may be a way to rethink the growth rate of the organic business in the electric companies that frankly has been a wee bit lackluster to improve that and really improve service to our customers at the same time. All of those things lead me to believe that we don't need new generation in the future until, say, the low 20s. We think we have a reasonable estimate as to environmental expenditures. I think we're in terrific shape to achieve the 5%. We've done that work last year and the work we're doing continuing. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Mike. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, Tom. How are you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking the call. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, thank you. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, in the event of abandonment for Vogtle, what's the possibility that prudence prior to 2016, through VCM number 16? What's the possibility that they could be revisited in light of the fact that the project would not be online, used and useful and as anticipated? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, the notion of prudence presumes we build the plant. And so I mean, it's a fair question. We believe that the costs were prudent, but it's a fair question. But anyway, we believe they were prudently incurred. I think you go through the process thinking you're going to build a plant. Who could have predicted that Westinghouse would have had the difficulty it had? So I actually think we're in reasonably good shape. But I mean, it's a fair question. I think it's a tail risk kind of question, in my opinion. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Do you think prudence includes a full return on capital though? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Prudence under the Georgia law, that basically puts it in a rate base. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I mean, even though the current deal for everything above $5.44 billion, you only get a debt return through construction. I mean, could we see something like that? Is it possible that they could go back and say that you only get a debt return on an unfinished plant? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: When you say is it possible? I guess anything's possible, but recall, even under abandonment, what you would do is take the Toshiba Guarantee against those amounts. So kind of use that in your thinking. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, that's true. Also, is there a possibility that you could be held, I guess, in any way responsible for not achieving the production tax credits, if the plant schedule goes beyond 2021 and there is no extension? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's conceivable also. I just \u2013 we're dealing with little hypothetics. I think it's going to happen though. I think even if you don't get tax reform this year, I feel reasonably confident given the importance of this issue, given the fact that it doesn't cost anything in the OMB scoring that I think we'll get support to figure out a way to get it done, that's just my belief. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And just to follow up on Steve's question about those credits. Is that, is the $800 million that you're expecting to get in value, is that included in the comparison analysis that's in the back of the VCM reports when you compared with CCGT? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I believe that's true. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Part of that, right? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes, but you need to remember, it's $400 million per each, so it's Unit 3 and Unit 4 split. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So I mean \u2013 basically, everything is assuming those credits are coming in and that's \u2013 yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: The only thing I would just add is that remember that the certificate assumes we only got 50% of those credits and we think we're going to get 100% now. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right, right. Okay. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah man. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with Citadel (01:12:49). Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Hey guys. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Ken (01:12:54). How are you? Unknown Speaker : I am good. Thanks. Could you guys provide some color on the decision-making process amongst the co-owners at Vogtle? And in particular, have your co-owners designated Southern to act as their agent on the decision whether to go forward or not go forward? Or does each individual owner make their own discrete decision? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, we act as agent in the execution of the EPC contract and all that stuff, but there are also provision for everybody to make their independent assessment as to how to proceed and if those assessments are different, what happens. But in general, the way you should think about that is we all generally agree on how to proceed. We've got a great working relationship. We've got a great working relationship with the co-ops and the munis in the city of Dalton. So I think I would just say that there are \u2013 we are the agent in executing the contract. We have ongoing conversations. And generally, I think almost exclusively, we reach consensus on how to approach these things. We have a really good relationship with those folks. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And the parental guarantee from Toshiba, does that stay with the project? Or does that travel pro rata with the co-owners, if they choose differently? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, probably we'll choose the same, okay? I mean, there are scenarios where they could be different, but no, it would be a pro rata guarantee. Unknown Speaker : The individual owners would have the right to their percentage of the guarantee individual of all the other parties? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. But it would be \u2013 I mean, I'm trying to think of an example that would fit your hypothesis. For example, that we only finish one unit and we decide not to do another unit, and somebody steps out and the other people stay in. The $3.7 billion would be divvied up based on the final arrangement that we enter into in this commercial agreement. We think that the draw schedule would be reasonably fixed and that they would access that guarantee on that basis, on a pro rata basis. Unknown Speaker : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Dan. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi. Good afternoon. My question kind of relates to when you talked about your Vogtle update, you mentioned that you have seen some meaningful improvements in productivity. I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on what you've been able to achieve and then of \u2013 related to that, how do you incorporate assumptions around productivity into your assessment, both of the scheduled length and costs because obviously those would be key inputs. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Oh, absolutely, man. In fact it's a great, it's a great question. What we've seen since the last call is a productivity improvement of around 20%, from 20% to about 30%. Use those as round numbers and we don't know whether they can be sustained or not. But productivity on the site since the last call has improved by that amount, okay? We want to get that number up to more like 40%. So Dan, in the evaluation of time to complete, cost to complete, we absolutely vary scenarios based on what we think we can sustain, from a productivity level. It's a very good question you're asking. And so what we do is take different cuts, okay? If it's 40%, it's this. If it's 30%, it's this. That's exactly how we're looking at it. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. So can you give me a little more detail on what kind of improvements you're seeing \u2013 like has it just been the amount of time that's taken to do things or the number of people that's taken to do things or what are the kind of... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, the key in improving productivity on the site is to reduce dead time. In other words, transit time from check-in to workplace, to have more effective management on-site, so that they do their job site briefings and then get work done. It's really that kind of thing. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then just on the details of the project. I just wondered \u2013 I know last time you mentioned that the steam generator installs were a key path item in that \u2013 for Unit 3. And then you mentioned the last CA modules for Unit 4. Are those upcoming? And I noticed they're still kind of in the same location on the slide that you included, so I just wonder if you can give us some updates on the critical path. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Dan, this is Art. Those things are constantly in motion around what gets prioritized. The steam generators had been moved back a little bit, but that doesn't mean that they were on the critical path to begin with. And so the critical path itself is in the nuclear island, but just those have now been put on the horizon rather than in the near term, but doesn't mean that we're not staying on schedule and improving the productivity within the nuclear island itself. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : How about on Unit 4? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Unit 4 is maintaining. You still have some modules yet to be placed, CA02 and CA03, but those are smaller modules compared to, say, CA01, which is already in place. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then, in terms of equipment on-site, what's the status of that and...? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, I think we've got 90%-plus of the equipment on-site already. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I think all major equipment is on-site, what you're really lacking now are commodities. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. How about the shield panels? Are those onsite (1:19:21)? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. That's doing \u2013 we're very well on the shield panels. I think on Unit 3, we're at the \u2013 at level or course 5 or 6, and on Unit 4, I'm not sure that we've started the shield panels yet, but we have. It's going to be much lower. But that's all on schedule. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Dan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead, sir. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Julien. Welcome. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Thank you very much, team. I appreciate it. So let's hopefully wrap this up perhaps with a little bit of a question on the resiliency, you guys have talked about in the past. I'd just be curious, what are the positive drivers that you're thinking about that you'd like to flag, to kind of offset any potential risks whatever they may be across either Kemper or Vogtle? And then a second specific question on the Kemper side of things, obviously, the previous conversations had suggested that you would get this thing in time for a June rate case. What does it mean if you don't necessarily trigger that? Is that all that meaningful? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, so let's hit the resiliency thing first. I think when we started talking about the balance beam and resiliency and all that early on, I know there were some questions about the ability of Southern Power to hit its numbers. Southern Power, I believe, has already done about half its CapEx round numbers this year and Southern Power already has the ability, I think, to hit its number this year as per our plan, which I think we flagged $300 million to $330 million last October. $315 million is a working number and they're going to hit that number unless the wheels fall off somehow. And then from 2018 to 2000 \u2013 what is it, 2021, we struck the agreement with RES and others and I think they've basically spoken for the CapEx that may show up there. So to the extent we do more than what we've already signaled, there's upside there. Further, I think there is a plan underway to improve the growth profile of the operating company further from October, there, I think, has the ability to improve the pace of pipeline replacement programs that are associated with safety elements and the \u2013 all the AGL Resources jurisdictions. We've expanded that and hopefully we've expanded the pace of investment there. So I think we have plenty of opportunity to do a little better. The other thing that you should know, you've followed us for 100 years or so, is that we are reasonably conservative in our estimates. When we say we're going to do something good or bad, that's kind of what we believe. We don't just throw about billions of dollars of CapEx filler; we really kind of know what we're going to do and we do that in concert with long-term regulatory relationships. When we put out a starting point, we do it with the notion of a no-regrets strategy. That is, we've already stress-tested against downside scenarios. So what you should know is that even within our 5% long-term growth rate, we have stress-tested against negative outcomes, and we're still confident in saying that we believe our 5% growth rate long-term is viable. So for all those reasons, we're sticking with it and I think the evidence of that is the board's decision to increase, even with Vogtle and Kemper, the rate of growth of our dividends per share. Second issue, was what? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Kemper. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, certainly would have been helpful. Let's not kid ourselves, to have Kemper up and running before the filing of the rate case. But you know, the rate case will take some period of time and so our expectation is that we will resolve the issues between now and then and be able to demonstrate performance. Recall though that the evaluation of performance in terms of reasonable period is 2018 and so that's kind of the first time we have to step up to some disclosed performance. And I think we've already disclosed that in 2018, our expected availability was around 30% to 35%. So that's a 2018 number, okay? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Excellent. So basically, bottom-line, you could file a rate case nonetheless or is this more about just shifting the rate case timing irrespective and... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. We will file the rate case. The law in Mississippi basically says within a reasonable period of time before the asset is in service, we could certainly do that. So the asset's in service in Jan 1, 2018, I think this is easy. So June 3 is the deadline to get that done. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, all right, so yeah, you'll just prove it up at some point during the pendency of the rate case. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. Thank you all gentlemen. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, and actually our performance criteria really goes to the year of 2018. Okay. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Excellent. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Appreciate you being on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : How are you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So just \u2013 most of my questions have been answered, but there was a comment by one of the Georgia Commissioners that he was sort of looking into the idea of a Kemper type of cap for Vogtle. And I just was wondering if you could sort of address how we should think \u2013 I know you guys are very risk knowledgeable and what have you. How we should think about your ability \u2013 obviously, it's early, but how you think about that kind of an idea? That's number one. And then number two, I was wondering if you could just address this Reuters story that seemed to be pretty critical of Westinghouse management, and whether you think the issues that were addressed in that article have been resolved, is that old history? Or just how you view that rather \u2013 that article, which seems kind of negative if you follow me in terms of Westinghouse. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, let's hit the first one. I think I've kind of gone through this at length a little bit. The relationship between Georgia and its Commission in terms of putting into place effective regulation for the benefit of customers and reliability and price and service, has served us all so well for so long. There is nothing out there to me that indicates that that constructive relationship \u2013 I mean, they're tough regulators, don't get us wrong, but that constructive relationship will remain in place. And certainly, any sort of regime we consider in the future will be central to our belief as to whether it is appropriate should Westinghouse reject the contract for us to proceed with construction or not. All of that is integral into how we intend to proceed. So my best advice to you guys is to believe that we will continue to have a constructive relationship. And certainly, anything that seems to go away from that would also seem to inhibit us from going forward with a commitment to build. With respect to the Westinghouse thing, that's really a question for Westinghouse. I'll just say this. Steve Kuczynski is one of the best nuclear people in America today. He's come \u2013 I hired him away from Exelon, Steve, I mean, Steve. Christopher Crane is just a great guy, the CEO of Exelon. I think he might be the best nuclear guy in America, but he, I mean, Steve Kuczynski learned under his leadership, and Steve's brought a lot of those concepts to us and improved dramatically, I think, the whole performance of our nuclear fleet. I believe that even with the short period of time where we had been a lot more intrusive, we've seen some improvement. I think our ability is rather unique in this regard in order for us to take over as general contractor as apart from Westinghouse. Commenting on Westinghouse's own shortfalls is really not productive at this point. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Well, and I'm not asking you necessarily to comment or to pile on them or anything like that. But the reason why I asked the question is because you guys may end up taking over the project. And if you do, I guess it's kind of \u2013 I guess, the idea obviously would be, what are you sort of taking over? Do you follow me? I mean. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's \u2013 yeah. I'm sorry, bud. Go ahead. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : No, that's basically. I think you understand what I'm saying. I mean, in other words, my concern is what one's concern could be is that if you take this thing over and it's been \u2013 what exactly are you taking over? Do you follow what I'm saying? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Are we taking over a bag of bones? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, yeah. No, thanks for the question and then it's a very fair question. Look, we have had \u2013 and just kind of to mention this. We had about 400 people on active oversight here and you can imagine there has been a lot of give-and-take as to our evaluation of what was going on first between Westinghouse and Shaw and then Westinghouse and CBI and then Westinghouse by themselves. And we have always had suggestions for improvement and we didn't want to interfere with the fixed price contract that we had because that would limit our ability to collect under that contract and take away the liability of Westinghouse. So from a commercial standpoint, we had to be reasonably careful about how intrusive we were. But you should know that we have, I think, great transparency into what we think it will be required in order to finish from an hours and cost standpoint. We'll have a darn good idea of what we're taking over and I think a darn good idea as to our ability to execute successfully given the different levels of productivity we may see. I don't think we're going to go into this blindly. Steve Kuczynski is leading the effort to evaluate those issues. And I think given his background, given his performance with us, I think we'll reach an effective recommendation for go, no-go, sometime after Westinghouse rejects and within the 30- to 60-day timeframe we've suggested. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Andrew Levi with Avon Capital. Please go ahead. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Hey, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Andrew, how are you? Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: I'm all right. 100 years for Julien, as for me and Paul and you too. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I guess it seems like 100 years. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Julien is just a puppy, smart puppy, very smart puppy. I guess, I just wanted to get back to a question that was answered \u2013 that was asked earlier... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: And I don't know if you can kind of answer it, but just kind of how we should think about this because you do have two other partners, it's Oglethorpe and MEAG and I've kind of discussed this with some people internally, your company. And I'll be honest with you, I try always to be honest, but I guess that's like kind of my next concern is that they're much smaller companies than you, especially MEAG and so their ability to kind of absorb these incremental costs may become an issue. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. And then since I guess I wasn't always realizing that you are working as the agent and I don't know if that's kind of written in the contract or the agreement, partners agreement. But I guess at some point, can they come after you in a legal aspect? Kind of what happened I think happened years ago with Vogtle 1 and Vogtle 2, not with these entities, but just kind of your thoughts on that and how you're protected in the agreement from that actually occurring beyond you guys having a good relationship. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. So Andy thanks, bud, don't forget about Dalton, they're in there, I forget what it is, 1.5% or something like that. So the city of Dalton is part of this also. Look, we have a terrific relationship with these guys. We have had \u2013 remember, they're part of Vogtle 1 and Vogtle 2. And so we've just had an ongoing relationship. It works exceedingly well, that's not to say we don't have discussions from time to time about issues, but we always seem to be able to work our way through them. I think their ownership shares are commensurate with their size. And so yeah, they are a different size, but I think they have the wherewithal to be able to follow through on their obligations. They are certainly different. They're not regulated by a public utilities commission like we have, but they have their own ability to manage rates and make sure that they are viable. So I mean here again, it's certainly a fair question. But I think you should assume, as a working assumption that they're going to be fine and that we'll work constructively with each other. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: And then just the legal aspect of it too? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You know what... Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's kind of a technical issue. Here's the thing. If you want a briefing on kind of the legal aspects of lawsuits among or between the co-owners, let's do that offline and I'll get a lawyer on the phone and he'll... Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. That's fair. Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, the only thing I just want to say, I probably should have said this earlier when I was talking about the resiliency of our long-term growth rate of 5%. I think what we've been able to do is demonstrate that we can operate that long-term growth rate at 5% within a similar risk profile. Recall that 95% of our earnings are associated with super-high quality, state-regulated integrated businesses. And even of the 5%, you have things in there or they're under long-term contract, and even with the 5%, gosh, some of that is exceedingly consistent, for example, the Georgia Natural Gas Marketing business. That just doesn't vary from year over year over year, and they don't have much weather risk because they hedge most of it. So the beta associated with our ability to deliver on the 5% on an ongoing manner is really good within the similar risk profile that we've demonstrated for decades. And I'm very proud of that. I know there's a lot of headline risk out there with Southern right now. If you peel the onion, what you see, especially with the ash that the board took with the (01:35:59) dividend, you find a super successful company, one of the icons in our industry and a company that has demonstrated year over year over year. Look at a chart of our dividend, of being able to deliver on behalf of its shareholders. We intend to continue to do that and we look forward to talking about it in the future. Thank you for joining us today and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude The Southern Company First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.

Operator : Southern Company's Second Quarter Earnings Call will feature slides that are available on our Investor Relations website. You can access the slides at www.investor.southerncompany.com/webcast. Good afternoon. My name is Beatrice, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everybody to the Southern Company Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 2, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Beatrice. Welcome to Southern Company's second quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call may be reviewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Our premier state-regulated electric and gas operating companies performed well during the second quarter and it remain on track to deliver on their targets for 2017 on an adjusted basis. Art will provide a complete overview of our financial results in just a moment, but I'd like to first provide updates on the status of the Kemper and Vogtle projects. First, Kemper. Let me provide you with a brief review of key events over the past 12 months. In July 2016, as we worked to fulfill our obligation under the PSC certificate order, we fully transitioned out of construction with the first production of syngas from the gasifiers. While the start up of the gasifiers and gas cleanup systems took longer than anticipated, substantial progress was made towards in-service. Along the way, we demonstrated every major facet of the TRIG technology at a commercial scale, including the gasification of lignite, the capture and sale of carbon dioxide and the production of electricity with syngas. This past February, Mississippi Power filed an updated economic viability study, which indicated that operating the IGCC on lignite would be less economic than operating the combined cycle on natural gas in most future scenarios. The primary factor driving this result was an updated natural gas price forecast reflecting lower sustained prices of almost 25% over the long term. Recall, Kemper was conceived at a time when natural gas prices were approximately $10 per million Btu and had significant market volatility. In May of this year, it was determined that a critical component, the superheater section of the syngas coolers would need redesign and replacement over the next two to three years. Replacement of the superheaters would require significant lead time for design, fabrication and installation and add significantly to cost above the cost cap. Even though we all felt we could achieve commercial operations in the near-term, this issue hurt the sustainable operating profile of the plan. On June 21, the Mississippi Public Service Commission made its expectations clear with public statements and a subsequent order on July 6, establishing a docket to encourage a settlement reflecting no gasifier-related customer rate increases and operation of the Kemper plant as a natural gas combined cycle. During this period, Mississippi Power suspended operations and startup activities for the gasifier. Recall that since 2014 in August, operation of the Kemper combined cycle has provided Mississippi Power customers with clean, safe and reliable low-cost energy. The plant has operated at availabilities, well surpassing industry norms. While operating the Kemper facility solely on natural gas for the long-term is far from ideal, however, consistent with current and long-term projections of natural gas, we believe it is in the best long-term interest of our customers, investors and other stakeholders. Mississippi Power continues to actively negotiate with the Public Utility Staff and other intervening parties with the intent to have a proposal filed that meets the conditions of the PSC's July 6 order, on or before August 21. Our second quarter financial statements reflect a pre-tax charge of $2.8 billion to write-down the remaining investment in the gasification portion of the facility that is no longer improbable of rate recovery. Not included in the charge are any future cancellation costs, which are currently estimated to range between $100 million and $200 million. There is $500 million of the combined cycle investment, not currently in rate, which is subject to recovery through the Settlement Docket established on July 6. We will provide update as appropriate as the settlement process continues. And now, for an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the Vogtle Owners have made great progress since our last earnings call in preserving all available options and Georgia Power is in the final stages of forming its recommendation to the Georgia PSC. As a reminder, Georgia owns 45.7% of this project with the rest, owned by MEAG, Oglethorpe Power and the City of Dalton. Combined, our ownership group represents a state-wide partnership that has served Georgia electricity customers for decades. As we contemplate the future of this project, our interest must remain aligned to ensure that the best overall answer for the customers, communities and economy of the State of Georgia. Ultimately, the final decision will rest with the Georgia Public Service Commission. Georgia Power has kept the PSC informed of the process related to estimating the cost to complete Vogtle 3 and 4 and other related activities over the past several months. We expect to file our recommendation in late August. Before providing a summary of our cost to complete the estimate, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss the agreements we have reached with Toshiba on the parent company guarantee and with Westinghouse to provide ongoing services to the project. First, we finalized an agreement with Toshiba in June regarding their Guarantee Obligations under our original EPC contract. The agreement fixes Toshiba's obligation to the project owners whether the project is completed or not at $3.68 billion or approximately $1.7 billion to Georgia Power Company. There is a monthly payment schedule, which begins in August of 2017 and ends in July 2021. The $920 million letter-of-credit or $420 million to Georgia Power remain outstanding as collateral. Payment of the Guarantee Obligation could be accelerated as Toshiba also agreed to contribute a portion of the proceeds from its claims in the Westinghouse bankruptcy to the Vogtle Owners. This could include proceeds from international subsidiaries if those entities are part of a combined sale of Westinghouse and Toshiba's energy services business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Ultimately, while Toshiba's financial condition is uncertain, the Toshiba Guarantee agreement puts the Vogtle Owners in a better position. The first payment in October, totaling $300 million is the largest individual payment and will be an important signal regarding Toshiba's financial viability. The Vogtle Owners also recently finalized the Services Agreement with Westinghouse. This agreement took effect on July 27, having been approved by the bankruptcy court and the Department of Energy. While this agreement reduces the project scope for Westinghouse, they will continue as an important partner providing engineering, licensing support, procurement services and access to intellectual property. This contract extends until the units are operational or it can be cancelled after a 30-day notice that the project does not move forward. The effectiveness of the Westinghouse Services Agreement also officially signaled the orderly transition of the project sites to the control of Southern Nuclear. Southern Nuclear, which operates all of Southern Company's nuclear plants is the licensee for Vogtle 3 and 4. Southern Nuclear has held significant presence on-site from the beginning of the project with a focus on safety, compliance and oversight. Over the past several months, Southern Nuclear has moved personnel into key Westinghouse in subcontractor roles and in anticipation of taking the lead role on-site, which has allowed for a smooth transition and for construction momentum, to continue. Productivity on-site has improved significantly over the first half of 2017. This improvement can be attributed to several factors including improved leadership in the field, improved work package management and continuous monitoring and communication of performance. Southern Nuclear expects further improvement in these areas if the decision is made to complete the project. In that event, Southern Nuclear will hire a prime construction contractor, which could be a single firm or a combination of firms. With all major equipment on-site, with the engineering nearly complete, the primary success factor going forward would be productivity. The prime construction contractor will be provided with appropriate incentives and rigorous oversight to drive achievement of the construction milestone. Let's turn now to our estimate to complete. The process to get to this point has been robust. Our team was granted access to all the work that Westinghouse and its subcontractors have previously done on costs and schedule. Our own personnel combed through the information, went out into the field to verify quantities firsthand and confirm work reflected as completed. We also brought in external expertise, including individuals with recent nuclear construction experience and multiple consulting firms to vet our scheduled assumptions and uptake and validate our inputs. Our current assessment results in a range of potential schedule to complete both units with Unit 3 expected to be placed in service between February 2021 and March 2022, and Unit 4, between February 2022 and March 2023. Net of the Toshiba Guarantee Obligation, the schedule is estimated to result in $1 billion to $1.7 billion above the previous cost estimate of $5.68 billion, which included contingency of $240 million. Based on the preliminary spending curbs, Georgia Power is not projected to exceed $5.68 billion until 2019. Assuming proceeds for claims in the Westinghouse bankruptcy proceeding are received by 2019, this crossover point could extend into 2020. Through June 30, Georgia Power has invested approximately $4.5 billion in the project and has recovered approximately $1.4 billion of financing costs under the NCCR tariffs. If a decision is made to cancel the project, we have estimated Georgia Power's cancellation cost at approximately $400 million. The PSC will determine the appropriate process in which they consider our upcoming recommendation. We will continue to work with our co-owners and the PSC to reach the decision that is best for all stakeholders. In the meantime, Southern Nuclear will maintain momentum at the site. I'll turn the call over now to Art for our financial and economic overview. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, including the charges associated with Mississippi Power's Kemper project, we reported a loss for the second quarter of 2017 of $1.38 per share, compared to earnings of $0.67 per share in the second quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, we reported a loss of $0.73 per share, compared with earnings of $1.20 per share for the same period in 2016. Excluding the charges associated with the Kemper project, Wholesale Gas Services and other items described in our earnings materials, earnings for the second quarter of 2017 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 were $0.73 per share and $1.39 per share respectively. This compares with $0.75 per share and $1.34 per share for the same periods in 2016. Major earnings drivers to our adjusted results for the second quarter of 2017 included retail revenue effects at Southern Company's state-regulated electric businesses, offset by milder weather, increased interest expense and increased shares. As for our earnings estimate for the next quarter, we estimate that we will earn $1.06 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Moving now to an economic review for the second quarter. The U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, real GDP rose by 2.6% in the second quarter of 2017, driven primarily by consumer spending and fixed investment. Real GDP growth is expected to be 2.3% in 2017 and our service territories generally deflect these economic trends. Weather-normal retail electric sales for the quarter and year-to-date periods were down year-over-year by 0.4% and 0.8% respectively. These results were primarily attributable to lower sales in our industrial class with paper, primary metals and transportation segments, accounting for the biggest negative year-over-year results. However, a number of our industrial customers are pointing to stronger orders in the second half of this year. Economic development activity in our territory remains reasonably strong and forward-looking indicators suggest that energy demand should be within expectations of being flat to slightly positive for the remainder of this year. Within our service territories, we are encouraged by a variety of positive indicators. Year-to-date residential customer growth continues to exceed expectations with 15,000 new customers added in our gas service areas and almost 25,000 added in our electric territories. Employment and population growth in our combined electric and gas territories remains solid. Total nonfarm employment is up by 1.6% year-on-year in May, and we continue to see faster population growth in the rest of the nation, boosted by net in migration to Georgia and Florida. Let me now update you on our financing plans. In late June, Southern Company contributed $1 billion to Mississippi Power in anticipation of potential charges associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper project. Consistent with our commitment to preserving financial integrity on a consolidated basis, Southern Company has an equity need of approximately $1 billion. There are several moving parts in our business, which also impact funding needs that are still under development. The Vogtle Go/No Go decision certainly has potential implications to our long-term financing plans. Under a Go decision, we would require more debt and equity to maintain Georgia Power's regulatory capital structure. Considering potential proceeds under the Toshiba Guarantee agreement and the proceeds from a Westinghouse reorganization or sale, this is primarily a longer-term need. Under a No Go decision, our financing needs would be greatly reduced. Under either scenario, we do not anticipate Vogtle further changing our equity needs in 2017. As we alluded to in our last earnings call, we are actively evaluating opportunities to modernize our basic business operations as our customers' needs evolve. Our objective, as always, is to improve the way we serve our customers while maintaining affordable prices. These initiatives would have the benefit of strengthening our longer-term EPS growth, contribution from our state-regulated utility. While these modernization opportunities could increase our long-term funding requirements, we do not anticipate any changes this year, 2017. Another moving part is Southern Power. As we continue to evaluate and develop our pipeline of opportunities at Southern Power, we are evaluating the use of third-party tax equity to fund renewable projects. Southern Power is working to secure tax equity for the Cactus Flats wind project announced this week and will likely explore the same for projects in its 3,000 megawatt joint development pipeline. While our CapEx forecast for Southern Power is unchanged, the use of third-party tax equity could significantly reduce the amount of debt and equity deployed over our five-year forecast horizon. We plan to refine our long-term capital and financing plans over the next several months and provide an update on our third quarter earnings call. Our slide deck for this call includes an updated financing plan for 2017, which reflects the previously mentioned need for approximately $1 billion of additional equity. We remain committed to a high level of financial integrity, strong investment grade credit ratings and our objective of a longer-term 16% funds from operation to debt ratio. Now for an update on our EPS and our growth rate, and our dividend. We have accounted for probable outcomes of the Kemper project, which assumes no return on or return of gasification-related investments. Recognizing that we don't yet have a final regulatory solution for the Kemper project, we forecast an ongoing reduction to annual EPS of approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per share. The resulting long-term trajectory still reflects growth of approximately 5%, beginning in 2018. We will formally update our long-term EPS guidance after we have a Go/No Go decision for Vogtle. The base financing plan was developed before the Westinghouse bankruptcy and essentially reflects a Go scenario and approximately a 5% long-term EPS growth rate. Most importantly, our dividend trajectory remains intact under either a Vogtle Go/No Go scenario. The Southern Company board of directors has increased the dividend every year for the past 16 years. And for nearly 70 years, the company has paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter. Our dividend objective is to provide regular, predictable and sustainable growth. In turn, the board's dividend decisions had been predicated on a robust review of our long-term financial plan including risks, assessments for a variety of different outcomes. While purview over the dividend decision remains with our board, we believe annual dividend increases of $0.08 per share are sustainable. Our strong operating cash flows provide additional support to this belief. Over the next several years, we expect that cash flow from operations will average over three times the size of our common dividends and this ratio is approximately 10% higher than the past 16 years as a result of our current tax position. I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Art. July 1 marks the one-year anniversary of our merger with the former AGL Resources, now, Southern Company Gas. As you know, this acquisition was a major step in a broader strategy to further expand our business in a meaningful way across the energy value chain. In fact, earlier this week, the Southern Company Gas placed the Dalton Pipeline in service. With all of its capacity under contract for 25 years, Dalton represents one-third of Southern Company Gas's newbuild mainstream infrastructure and is expected to contribute approximately $10 million per year to income. The integration of Southern Company Gas into our business has gone extremely well and the combined companies now serve more than 9 million customers nationwide, with a portfolio of premier, state-regulated utilities. Southern Company Gas is a great addition to our company and should contribute positively towards fulfilling our shareholder value proposition for a very long time. Before we open the call to your questions, I would like to respectfully remind everyone that we do not want to get ahead of the regulatory processes in any of our states, including the ongoing negotiations in Mississippi and the filing and consideration of our Vogtle Go/No Go recommendation in Georgia. Thank you in advance for your understanding. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Hey good afternoon guys. A couple of questions. First, I just want to make sure I've got the baseline cost estimate to complete the plant sort of right as I know \u2013 I'm sure people are trying to benchmark that against the $18 billion cost that SCANA articulated in their decision not to move forward. If I take your $8.4 billion to $9.1 billion range, which is obviously before the guarantees and I gross that up, that gives me sort of $18.3 billion to $19.8 billion total plant cost? But I also know that, that might not be apples-to-apples because you have included in your cost estimate, costs in excess of what the Westinghouse was obligated to deliver the plant for that was like a little over $2.6 billion. So, am I right that the apples-to-apples cost is somewhere between $15.6 billion and $17.2 billion? Those are a lot of numbers, I apologize if that's not clear. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Let's first do this. And I know people are going to be interested in comparing our situation to SCANA's. There are a host of differences between our project and the Summer project that SCANA and Santee Cooper recently canceled. It really is apples and oranges. For example, the commercial terms for the projects were very different, the EPC cost, the guarantee, the different regulatory processes they went through, the cost cap over there. So, it's really \u2013 I really want to resist kind of a reconciliation of where SCANA is relative to where we are. Stick with our numbers. The other thing that's important about our numbers, I really don't know the process SCANA went through in developing their estimate. I can tell you that not only did our on-site people work very hard to develop estimates, we brought in a variety of external parties including folks that had been involved in the recent nuclear completion projects at TVA as well as estimates from both Bechtel and Fluor. We feel confident in our estimates. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So I should just stop with knowing that I grossed it up, the total plant cost? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. I think that's a... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : That is $18.3 billion to $19.8 billion, and not try to read through further from that. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. The second is, I heard you on your \u2013 what you said about the regulatory process, but can we just... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: However. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : However, I'm going to ask you a question. When are you going to file your plan? What do we think the time horizon is going to be until we get some sense of where the Commission is leaning? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : And should we assume that the plan will lay out options such as, and I'm theorizing here, we either abandon, we build two units, we build one unit, these are the different costs associated with each of these choices, which choice do you think is the right choice? Is that \u2013 or you normally didn't go that far? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Greg, I think what we're doing is working very closely collaboratively. I've often said in past years that our relationships with the staff, the Commissions is a continuous rather than discrete kind of relationship, so they've been briefed along the way. Further, we've been working hand-in-glove with our co-owners as we evaluate the different scenarios that we will consider. You should assume that we have considered the entire waterfront of options available to us and we've been pretty creative in pushing a lot of different ideas. I would expect that the results will converge on a single idea and we will provide that idea as a recommendation to the Georgia Public Service Commission sometime this month. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. And then is there any sense how long the process might take to come to a mutual decision? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. That's part of the process I'd rather not get into. Let the Commission decide how they want to handle that. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Fair enough. And then one quick question. The base case forecast as revised take into account the Kemper costs, again, that assumes the 5% growth off the lower base, assumes a Go decision as the base case? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. The base case assumes that we're building Vogtle. That's the case that was provided back in October. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Final question. If you were theoretically in a no-go posture, the amount of dollars that you would seek to recover under the Georgia legal framework would be whatever the quick balance is as of that point in time? Or would it be the quick balance plus the cancellation costs? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Both of those, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : But the financing costs are not, those are costs that have already been recovered, so would be... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's correct. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And of course, we wouldn't have the Toshiba Guarantee against that. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Right. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Right. And whatever tax benefits you got from in abandonment, correct? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Correct. That's it. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You got it. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. I know those were a ton of questions. I'll go to the back of the queue. Thanks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks Greg. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Anthony. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Good afternoon Tom. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hope you are well? Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : I just wanted to follow-up with Greg on slide 8 you talk about go and No Go decisions. Just one of the footnotes or the only footnote there was allowed recovery should you go no-go. And I know, just what is carrying cost mean, I guess is my question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Full cost of capital. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : So, both in equity and a debt return? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Has there been any other like a project or something that have already gone through this procedure? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Not to my knowledge. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then just lastly, the timing I guess with Greg, the decision, the utility is going to make a decision in August of a contractor? And then also in August, make a decision on what they believe and then that gets pushed to the Commission and then October, is the first payment from Toshiba and then some time after that, the Commission will make a decision. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. I mean, you should view the Commission to decide how and when it wants to make a decision, so let's be flexible there. I mean conceivably, they could make it really quickly or it could take time. The October payment, I think from Toshiba is an important milestone. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Angie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Super. I hope you're well. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I'm doing well today. Okay, so I think, you know, look we all saw the estimates from SCANA and then we're trying to compare them to yours, but from the perspective of your shareholders and the potential for the multiple expansion on your stocks, so we're talking about spending additional $1 billion to $1.7 billion over the next couple of years. This is your best estimate right now, but you never know what this final amount will be, and then for a similar amount, if not much less, you could build a gas plant. So how do you try to appease investors about the risks that you are undertaking by continuing the project if you continue versus just building a gas plant instead, especially as the load growth numbers seem to becoming below the prior expectations? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, there's a variety of issues underlying that and you should know that we evaluated building gas on the site relative or instead of finishing the new. So there's a whole host of issues. For example, it's not clear to me that where we did not go and pursue gas, that you would build gas at that site. We would need to build a rather lengthy pipeline and maybe other sites around Georgia that maybe more suitable for that. Adding the nuclear units give a much desired quality to the state's integrated resource plan that is fuel diversity. It is resilience to future carbon potential outcomes. I think there's a host of factors that would cause us to consider, if we decide to go forward, building new can feel very good about it. It's an important process to follow. I think the Commission has been very vocal about their desire for a reasonable outcome on nuclear. We already have a strong framework for recovery. We entered into that when we had the settlement agreement in the prudence proceeding. So we have a process that works, that process does not provide a cost cap to the extent that the capital costs are prudent. It only addresses return levels, cash, AFUDC. And then of course, once we clear those plants into service, they would leave that kind of settlement regime and revert back to the Georgia Power base rates. A lot of these things have been contemplated already. And I think from a political standpoint, from an operational standpoint, fuel diversity, a variety of other things, I believe that the state planning process is as evidenced by the integrated resource plans, that was discussed in 2016, I guess, approved in July, believe from the state of Georgia that nuclear is important. So while it is an option to build gas, I think on a lot of scenarios going forward with nuclear may make sense. Of course, we may decide not to and we'll see, but don't think about replacing the units with gas there. And one last point and this is a point frankly, I want to throw some kudos out to the current administration and Congress, boy, people don't say that very often these days. But let me tell you, as we have traveled around the globe, making sure that we get the best outcomes possible associated with the Toshiba Guarantee, with the Westinghouse portion, scope of the project, the Trump administration cabinet has been fantastic, whether it's been Rick Perry, Wilbur Ross, Mike Pence, any of those guys and their staffs have been exceedingly helpful in having us prosecute our interest here. Further in Congress, I'll say very clearly, folks like Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady were very helpful in getting a bill, Bipartisan Bill; Jim Clyburn, Nancy Pelosi and getting a bill out of Congress, out of the house anyway and we'll see where we'll go elsewhere in the Senate. So look, I'm sorry, Angie, I kind of rambled around on you. I think the issue really goes to, besides just straight economics and we think economics still favor \u2013 at least the economics we present will favor whatever we decide to do. Don't consider gas at the site as the right replacement. If we do a no-go, you'll build gas, but it'll be elsewhere. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Understood. I'm just, again, I'm just trying to understand, you're adding two years of the nuclear construction risk and yes, I understand regulators want the plant to be finished, that these steps what it seem like to me from their public statements, but I'm just trying to see if there's a way to get some additional assurances for shareholders, just in case, this is now two years, let's say three years and if that original estimate turns out to be too low. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. I would argue that what investors, owners should look towards is number one, the generally constructive environment in Georgia. Number two, we have a framework in place that will provide for rates of return during the construction period, however long it is, and assuming you have a prolonged scenario, as you suggest, that once you finally complete that these assets will return to the normal Georgia rate regime for decades to come. It's interesting, you could make a short-term decision or you could make a long-term decision here. I think we're all trying to balance those two things and coming up with a recommendation with the Commission. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Angie, it's Art. I think it's also important to remember and Tom addressed this a little bit in his script, was that this is going to be an owner-led process through one or two major contractors where we're going to control the metrics of performance and we'll have immediate responsiveness to however that performance is going around the productivity of the asset. It's also important to remember where we are in the construction, the scope going forward is very clear. All the equipment and most major equipment is on-site already and so it's a matter of constructing the equipment that's already there on-site, so it merely becomes an instruction performance metric as we move forward. And that gives us a little more confidence as we look forward as to these timeframes. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And the data supports that we have been hitting just about the targets we want on a constant schedule here very recently as we've taken over the site. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Tom. Good afternoon. So just to clarify the, in terms of the growth rate and the earnings, you could just take $0.08 to $0.10 off of the base and grow 5%? Is it as simple as that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, virtually it's the same math. I would have grown it 5% and then reduce that $0.08 to $0.10 and that's where you are and then grow 5% there on. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. And then in terms of the Toshiba Guarantee, couple of questions there; first, as you get the money, how should we think about it being applied? Is it effectively applied as an offset to the investment and not needing the recovery in rates? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then I assume the October date is important just to make sure Toshiba actually pays it. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right, and recall, the way we've structured this agreement with Toshiba with respect to their Guarantee, when you think about this draw schedule, we think the riskiest payments are the ones further out, right? So what we've done is provided for the normal draw of the LC to backstop the furthest draws away from us right now to the extent they defaulted on this $300 million payment in October, we could accelerate the draw on the LC and take care of it that way. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then on the equity needs, you mentioned, Art, a lot of factors. Most of those you talked to them being equity beyond 2017. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Right. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : The one I'm not sure was clear was on the Southern Power, changing and how you're financing things there would. Could that impact the 2017 equity or is that also further beyond 2017? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: We don't think so, Steve. The $1 billion that we've outlined we think will cover the waterfront including all the businesses and use of third party tax equity for Southern Power. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It could have an impact beyond that. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And one last question is, does the Summer abandonment have any kind of practical impacts, good or bad, on kind of the workforce availability, just all \u2013 I assume there's a lot of resources up there that might be applicable for your site. PTCs, does it do anything there? Is there any just high-end for your project that is worth talking about? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. I mean, I think you started to suggest, am I right. Best athletes will be available. In other words you're not going to stretch personnel resources, whether that's skilled craft labor, whether that's leadership in either a Fluor or Bechtel or anybody else that maybe brought to bear to the site. Certainly, with respect to the availability of PTCs, I expect that we'll be successful ultimately in Congress. They've all indicated a willingness to help. We just got a stuck-up procedurally with frankly, Obamacare and the Senate. So I think all those things will work to our benefit. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : I had one last question, I forgot. The existing rate agreement on the $5.7 billion, my recollection is that when you \u2013 the plant had to be running by 2020? Or once you hit the $5.7 million, you went to like a lower ROE? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's it. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Is that \u2013 it's simple as that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, and that's only during construction and what you would expect to see if we drew the line out for what we expect out of earnings per share in this 5% growth trajectory, that's a long-term growth trajectory. To the extent you're in one of those periods where you hit the 7% ROE or whatever, you would have kind of a drop in the earnings power of those assets for a period of time, but once you cleared the in-service, they would return back to the regular regime of Georgia Power. We believe that circumstance should it occur, would only occur post 2020 and would be like a year or two or whatever the circumstances warranted at that time. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Ali, how are you? Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, Tom. How are you? Good afternoon. So first question, just to clarify, the $1 billion equity that you need this year just from a timing perspective, do you need to have that Kemper settlement filed by August 21 or any of the Vogtle documents filed before you can issue that equity or are those two things unrelated, how should we think about that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Ali, it's a good question. At this point, we haven't detailed what timing will be and we think they're unrelated. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I think you want to make sure you have appropriate disclosures at that point. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right, that's right. We've got a lot of disclosures going around, but we just have to pick the right time sometime in the second half. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: We certainly would prefer quieter waters to issue into. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. But as you said, on the disclosure front, there's no requirement that you need to have that out there? I mean, I'm just talking from an SEC legal requirement point of view. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. As long as you had appropriate disclosures, I think you'd be okay. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: And we're in an open window. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Okay, got it. And then coming back to the growth rate scenario as you said, that's baked in a go scenario, but does that factor in these potentially higher costs at Vogtle and then the incremental equity need, Art, that you were talking about, how would that sort of change that trajectory or is that already baked into the new line, that you're showing us? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, it accounts for all the capital requirements that a Go decision would require. And obviously, that's going to be spread out over time. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: If you think about the $1 billion to $1.7 billion, it is additional, if you think about the timeframe in which they'll be realized, it's had really a modest impact. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: And it's really, it's not until post 2020 before you're even looking at spending over and above what our current plan already took into account. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And our sense is you would finance that with the same mix of capital as we always do. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And the timing would be such as well in terms of when that additional equity would show up basically? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's right. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. And then as you're going through this process on the Vogtle front, as you mentioned, there's the ROE and that may be a timing issue for a couple of years, what about your partners' ability to fund those additional costs, as you said, you'd want everybody to move together. At the end of the day, if it is a Go decision, it's the thought that on that the current ownership structure stays as is, or is there a possibility that that changes? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: No, we believe it will stay as is. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: In terms of percentage ownership of everybody? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's it. We worked under this kind of relationship for really decades and it's worked great. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then last question. As the Toshiba payments start coming through as you said, that's a multiyear process and you've got some backstop with the LC, but to the extent that there is \u2013 the LCs are covered and there's still space left, is there a scenario where the Commission could revisit whatever the new numbers are today, or is the thought that whatever those numbers are, are pretty much set over the duration of the project? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, yeah, let's add to the security package this notion of, so you have the LCs. We have a share of whatever proceeds come from the sale of Westinghouse out of bankruptcy. There also is a non-subordination agreement that would essentially preserve under many cases our subordinate position relative to the bank credit that already exists or that existed at Toshiba as of the date of the agreement. So we kind of have those three features, but you're right. There is an element that is uncovered in which we're essentially taking Toshiba credit risk. Now our idea was to front end load those exposures, so that in the near term, we think we'll know very quickly and get those behind us. So strategically, that's how we thought about the draw schedule and the rights to the sale of Westinghouse and the LC. There are always opportunities for the Commission and the company and the co-owners to evaluate off ramps, if conditions change materially. Say for example, Toshiba doesn't pay its $300 million, say there's an extreme force majeure event, the Commission always has the opportunity to evaluate best course forward. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right, okay. And then last question, Tom, coming back to Kemper and the amount of investment that's not in rates. If you run the math on that amount, the EPS impact comes out much larger than the $0.08 to $0.10 you've talked about and in that $0.08 to $0.10, I presume you've also put in the $1 billion of extra equity, so can you just help in the math? I mean, was there some disallowance that you had originally assumed in your original numbers that gives you that cushion? Or how do does math work to get us to that $0.08 to $0.10 hit from Kemper? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. When we gave you the financial plan way back in October when we had our Analyst Day, we intentionally crafted our long-term growth rate on a conservative basis and we allowed for, under a variety of circumstances, wherever it may occur, some cushion, if you will, in terms of adverse impacts that may occur and still provide the long-term 5% growth rate, and that's what gave rise to this notion of resilience. So that has always existed. We believe that taking the gasifier off the playing field, so to speak, really leaves the Commission with pretty clear kind of evaluation. That is they're not dealing with a gasifier anymore. They're dealing with a combined cycle unit that has run among the best of any combined-cycle unit in the United States, E4, less than 1%, average E4 for combined cycles fixed or whatever it is, and it has served a tremendous amount of energy for the citizens of Mississippi since 2014. So what we're left with, I think in Mississippi is how does the Commission want to treat the company on a sustaining basis. We believe we should be treated fairly there. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey, howdy ho. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. How are you? Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I just want to clarify and follow-up on Ali's question. Does the $0.08 to $0.10 explicitly include the dilution from the $1 billion or does it not? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It does. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: It does, okay. And then is the parent $500 million junior subordinated notes new in terms of financing? And will you get equity credit for that with the rating agencies? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes, we do get equity credit and I believe that we have already issued a good amount of that \u2013 I can't remember the dollar amounts \u2013 earlier this year. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then also, I guess following up on a question that might have been asked previously. Are you going to wait for the Vogtle Go/No Go decision before issuing equity? Or is it possible that you could issue in two pieces? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes, Paul, we did answer the question before but they're unrelated. Remember, we've said the Vogtle need, if it's a go, would create more longer term equity needs than shorter term. So we view those as unrelated, whereas the equity needs this year would be addressing the Kemper write-offs. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And all you're asking really I think comes down to having appropriate disclosure and everything else. So I mean, theoretically, you could issue equity before you have the decision in Georgia or not. You just have to make appropriate disclosures. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yes, no, no, it wasn't from a disclosure perspective. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Okay. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: But thank you very much and that's it from in terms of questions. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hi Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Tom, I want to change the topic. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Okay. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: You made some commentary about potentially some programs at the core electric utilities where you might find ways to serve customers more efficiently. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But then you didn't go into a, 'hey, we're going to implement some kind of major O&M reduction program.' That doesn't seem to be what you're talking about. I may be wrong there. It almost seems like it's more of a capital opportunity, meaning an investment in the infrastructure. Can you just talk a little bit about this size... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sure. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...scale, decision time line, all that kind of good stuff? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, every company is working through it right now, but the idea is kind of a modernization kind of thing, and what we would do is put greater intelligence in the wires, greater resilience into the transmission system, generating plants, more technology involved in customer service. For example, one of the things we've done recently at Georgia, just as an example, we did close down some human interfaces in some of the local towns, but we manifold increased the customer touch capability through technology, kiosks and other things. So frankly \u2013 and we found that customers, frankly, love that stuff. And, in fact, I want to say, Georgia Power this year was voted the number one most trusted utility, even after all of these rather profound changes in the way we approach customers. Likewise, all of our companies generally set the bar across the United States in terms of customer satisfaction. So the big trade, I would argue, is one in which we are likely, and this will probably take the form of capital for the most part, putting way more technology out there and making whatever adjustments we need to operating-wise. The other one, Michael, I would add and this kind of goes to my hat that you know I have for all the electric utility industry, co-ops, communities, and IOUs. On this whole cyber and physical security realm, I think it's real important, and this even reaches EPA and I made these arguments in the last administration. It's very clear that the resilience of our systems, whether its resilience to physical attributes or cyber-attacks, we really need to think differently about how to make sure that electricity flows and electronic commerce and the digital age is able to be undertaken. And my sense is, we need to think about resiliency not just in n-2 transmission standards but in standards that will provide cyber-protection that nobody has even thought about three years ago. And certainly, we are leading the way along with some of my other peer companies in things like machine-to-machine capital additions as opposed to human-to-machine defenses in the cyber realm. So there's a lot going on there. I think there's lots of opportunity to improve the delivery of our product and make it more resilient on behalf of our customers. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Have you had an opportunity to vet this yet with either Commission staff or intervenors or others or even the Commissioners themselves? And at what point in the coming months or years do you think you might actually, I don't know, quantify some of this when you're thinking about your capital budget updates? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. I would argue this is kind of an ongoing discussion. When we think about, I guess, the next rate case in Georgia will be 2019, Alabama has an annual process, Mississippi has PEP, Gulf just went through a process. These are the kinds of discussions that we have along the way. So you should view this again as a continuous process rather than discrete. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of the Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hey, how's it going? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So let me just follow up a little bit here on the go/no-go, because it looks when you look at the slide that the no-go has the cost of financing and that doesn't seem to be \u2013 I mean you have a footnote about it in the slide, but I just wanted to touch base. So if I look at it, would it be appropriate if you were to include financing in the Go way? You take $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, subtract $1.4 billion, which you've already spent, and then add that to the $1.0 billion, $1.7 billion to come up with something like $2.7 billion to $3.8 billion? Does that make sense? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: You lost me in all those numbers. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's basically right. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then with respect to Toshiba payments, you're looking forward to about $300 million payment my understanding is in October, and then you mentioned that you'll draw down the LOC if you don't get that. If you do get it, does the LOC change at all? I think it's around $920 million, am I right about that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, and there's a reduction at some point, $200 million or so, but the $700 million would remain outstanding for the balance of the draw schedule. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's right. And remember, $3.7 billion is 100%. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: It's $1.7 billion for Georgia Power. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And so when I'm thinking about that, though, I guess, what I'm trying to figure out here is the staff, just as recently as Friday, believed that the Toshiba guarantee is really your problem, so to speak, whether you get it or not. Is there anything else we should think about as being potentially exposure to I guess to sort of Angie's question, exposure to ratepayers if \u2013 as we go forward with respect to any exposure that might happen or contingencies we should think about that...? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Without going beyond, kind of, we already have a rate settlement regime in place that established the recovery of the settlement cost plus a prudence evaluation. That remains in place and will cover I think all these questions. With respect to any of the details, the gives and takes along the way, let's not get ahead of the any kind of discussion we will have at the Commission. Let that process play out. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, fair enough. And then... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Paul, it's Art. Let me make sure you're clear as well. We've got the LOC as a mitigant and we also have the proceeds from the sale of Westinghouse out of bankruptcy that could potentially be a mitigant to that exposure as well. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Right. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: We have no idea what that will be, but it's another piece of the pie. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I got you. And then the 5% growth is with the go scenario. What would the growth be without the go scenario? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It depends on what that looks like, how much recovery we had, all that other stuff. It really gets into the regulatory settlement process. So if you'll bear, give us forbearance here, let me defer that one. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks again. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, buddy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just wanted to follow-up on Ali's question on partners, and I just wanted to make sure I was clear. Should we presume that you all will be going sort of arm-in-arm together in terms of the path that you want to take later this month? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, understood. And then just a small clarifying question on the go/no-go page that's got so much interest. On the right-hand side on the no-go, the benefit from the guarantee obligations, was there a reason that wasn't \u2013 I know it's in the note below, but was there a reason that wasn't shown in terms of the net impacts of no-go? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. We've already beaten up the accountants on the presentation. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's all I had. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisers. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Hey, guys. Obviously, all the questions have been asked. The only thing I have is just on the balance sheet. So after you issue your equity, this is again specifically on the parent level. So you do all this financing that you've outlined, what will the estimated equity ratio be at that point? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Andy, I'm going to guess, it's going to be in the high-30%s and that would be my guess right off the top of my head. But... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: But the math we're solving to... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: ...is not equity ratio, it's the FFO. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Right. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : No, no, no, I know, I know how the ratings agencies look at it, right. After you do the $1 billion and you did the $435 million and the $158 million, and I don't know, I guess the junior subordinated wouldn't be included. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Right. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : But you'll be around 37% or 38%, I'm sorry, you said. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, that's off the top of my head. We can get back to you in the boiler room, if you want here. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : That's all right. And then where would you like to be a year or two from now? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, as we go a year or two from now, is if we're going to have the kind of credit quality that we're solving to, so go to your coverage ratio. As we produce on the 5% earnings per share growth rate, we have the dividend payout ratio that continues to improve. The growth rate of dividends at $0.08 a year, assuming the board stays with it. We believe there's every reason they will, but it's their decision at the end of the day. We would suggest that our payout ratio falls reasonably quickly into the mid-70%s and that's kind of what the company looks like. The old good Gordon model, we've talked about that one in the past, cash flow over K minus G. We're taking Kemper off the table. We are moving forward in a \u2013 I think a reasonably transparent way with Vogtle. So I would argue that K might drop a bit. G remains its size, and cash flow and the numerator looks like it's a pretty steady increase in the dividend growth rate over time. Remember what we did in '16 and why that is so important. That really gave us a steady ship in which to ride through sometimes these turbulent waters. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. I think in the past you've said you've kind of wanted to be around 40% of the parent, but I guess as the rating agencies don't seem to care that much about the parent equity ratio, they seem to care, as you said, about FFO to debt. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : I guess that's what your main focus is. It's not the equity ratio as much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Andy, the other thing that's just kind of fun to think about here is how much of our earnings are coming from our state-regulated utilities. Something like 96% came this quarter, 93% roughly of this mix between state regulated utilities came out of our electric side. We are still, as we were, a state-regulated dominant company. In the balance $0.09, so if you say $0.60, $0.70 kind of state-regulated, $0.09 came out of long-term energy infrastructure deals. So average contracts, I don't know, 14 years or so. So the nature of who we are, even after all the stuff we did in 2016 remains a very kind of low-beta proposition. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. And then the other question I have is just last year was \u2013 or 1.5 year, last 1.5 year, you were pretty aggressive on the acquisition front, and I guess you did make an acquisition yesterday on the wind side I believe it was, but whether Sonat or whether it was AGL after many years of really not being aggressive, where would you say Southern's head is at, at this point, when it comes to corporate/assets beyond renewables M&A? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, I would give you the same answer I've given in years past. Corporate M&A is extraordinarily hard, and you really have to have the right mix of chemicals in the sea in order for something to crawl up on the beach. We've always taken a disciplined approach. It would have to be accretive in a matter of months, not years. It would have to be at an acceptable credit profile. It would have to be consistent with our long-term strategy. I've been talking for years, gosh, I could remember even back when I was CFO, that we needed more exposure to gas infrastructure. I've never wanted exposure to the commodity. I want exposure to the things that move the commodity, and that's what we were able to execute. And when you think about the risk/return profile of AGL Resources and then the Kinder Morgan Sonat transaction, boy, those are right down our strike zone. And as you can see, not only they performed well, they've exceeded our expectations. But if we remain a state-regulated integrated utility with regular predictable sustainable earnings that give us regular, predictable, sustainable dividend per share, and you can see us follow through on that. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks, bud. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed with your question Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Ashar. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Hi, how are you doing, Tom? I guess from the conversation we've had to present, it's pretty much clear that it is a Go decision. I don't know what else to make of this. Because otherwise, Tom, if I'm correct, right, and I wanted to run that because you didn't mention it in your slides. SCANA had $1.5 billion of tax benefit. And so if you do the No Go decision, there should be a lot of tax coming in backwards and liquidity should be improved and you might not need this equity, the amount that you're doing, the $1 billion in a no-go situation. That's why they can go ahead and buy back their stock the next two years. And I would assume a similar scenario would occur to you is that there would be a lot of cash benefits on abandonment case, which would flow back to the enterprise and should reduce your equity needs even with the present one. So am I wrong in that assumption, question number one? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So let me just kind of answer it holistically. In our view, when you think about abandoning Vogtle 3 and 4, there's really three moving pieces : one, deals with the potential for stranded cost, that is our investment to-date; the second deals with the value of the Toshiba guarantee; and the third, as you mentioned, deals with potential tax benefits. The other thing that remains is your long-term relationship with the state general assembly, the regulators, everything else, because when you abandon, you have nothing to show for the amount of money you've spent. If we go forward, we have a nuclear plant that will serve us for decades to come. But please understand, there has been no decision made and that decision will only be made when we reach a recommendation in conjunction with and collaboration with our co-owners and in collaboration with the PSC that has the final say. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Okay. Okay. No, I understand that. My only point was, Tom, that why would you not delay your equity offering till that final determination is made because it could be beneficial. You might not need to issue this equity because equity dilutes us permanently. You know what I mean? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, here's the issue. You should think about the equity we're talking about associated with Kemper, okay? That any incremental equity associated with finishing Vogtle 3 and 4 is well into the future. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : No, but I'm thinking of the equity refund we might get in case we decide to abandon. Are you with me? That's the way I'm looking at it, that if you do the No Go decision, because of the income tax benefit and also from the guarantee, there should be things coming back to you. This would be... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: (01:15:56) Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Ashar. The other issue that I think you have to consider with Southern is we're in an NOL position. So to the extent you get a tax benefit from cancellation, you won't see the incremental cash until after the NOL is expunged. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Okay. And when does that happen? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That would be some time in the future. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Ashar, it could push it out another 1 year or 1.5 years before you actually get some cash, all of the cash associated with the No Go decision. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : (01:16:30) Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I've been kind of pedantic and I hope I'm not driving people crazy, but the decision to go or no-go goes way beyond the presence of cash in the next few weeks. It's going to go into a host of economic factors and qualitative factors that really take effect for decades. So this is not 1 year or 2-year decision. This is a decades decision. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Okay. Fair point. Thank you so much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. I guess most of the questions and a lot of questions have been addressed so thanks guys for taking the time. We appreciate it. I guess just on the tax impacts on the No-go part. Does that impact rate base? Will that come out from deferred taxes? And how much is that a hit to rate base in a No-go situation? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Praful. You're really getting ahead of the regulatory situation there as well as to how that would be treated. I think under a normal framework, it would be a reduction to rate base. However, there could be a number of different ways that you could go about treating that. And so I think it's a little early to be asking that question for us to give you any kind of direct guidance as this depends on the regulatory environment. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you, fair enough. And then on the tax equity that you mentioned where you're going into renewables or buying more projects more from a tax equity partner, I guess what's the leakage associated with that as an IRR is impacted, given the tax equity investor obviously needs some kind of return? And will that reduce the ability to invest capital? Or do you still see enough opportunities out there even with a tax equity partner coming in? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I'd be kind of surprised. I'll let Art, jump in. What's different is the shape as opposed to the actual quantum of IRR. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, that's true. And the accounting for third-party tax equity, we would still capitalize the amount of the $1.5 billion a year, but we would have the third-party financing provide a good portion of that upfront. So it would mean less debt and equity from Southern's perspective. It would mean correspondingly less income, but the structure and framework of the income over the first five years is actually richer and actually contributes to our 5% EPS growth. So you're earning less income, but you're issuing less equity, but it still performs on our 5% growth path. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. But then, I guess, if I break out that 5% and exclude the impacts of these kind of projects, which we more look at, at least when we evaluate it, more look at it from an IRR or cash flow perspective. Are you saying that the underlying utility business profile is a little weaker and is boosted by the tax equity benefits, sorry, the way the tax equity, I guess, is accounted for and that benefits, I guess, achieving or hitting your 5% target growth rate? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: No. No, they still all have to meet the hurdle rates that we established for that business given the risks associated with each specific project and including the impacts of third-party tax equity, that's the way we evaluate it. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Well, thanks a lot guys. I appreciate you taking the time. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: You're welcome. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, thank you. I appreciate you tuning in. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, how are you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Great. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I guess, I really appreciate the extended timeframe here. The page 8, the cost estimates for Vogtle Go, does that include the nuclear PTCs? Does that make an assumption that those are going to be go-forward with that? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: No. It doesn't include. Those are credits back to fuel at Georgia Power and aren't reflected in the capital cost at all. As you have nuclear generation, you get a credit for the amount of nuclear generation in the particular year up to a limit, and that's how that's accounted for as a benefit to customers. So it would be reflected in the ultimate price that your customer would pay and that's why they're important to us. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. So it affects the final rate increase at the end. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, absolutely. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. And then one more question about the tax equity. How does that affect the 16% targeted FFO to debt, as you take on more tax equity in the beginning? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, we're working with the rating agencies around all that and right now, they don't see any real problem with that, but discussions will continue as we move along as we always have discussion with rating agencies as things evolve. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, they've been supportive. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And I think I understood that the 5% growth rate on EPS assumes that a Vogtle Go decision is made. It's unclear \u2013 I guess, you weren't really quite sure how much it might get reduced in a No-go situation, but I think if I heard you right, you did reiterate a dividend growth of 8% increases or $0.08 increases is sustainable even under No-go, is that a correct statement? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's correct. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And what we said, remember, we weren't presuming a current state Go. What I suggested was that would be assumption back in October when we gave you the financial plan. So I mean, the answer is the same, but I didn't want to prejudice anybody judging as to what we were saying here. We've not made the call on Go/No-go, but even on a No-go situation, the current dividend policy is robust. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. All right, thanks a lot. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Dan. How are you doing? Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi. Good afternoon. So I hate to keep beating this dead horse, but I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about slide eight in the way that I expect certain parties to the proceeding will, at least the staff and commissioners and the interveners. So if I want to make sure I'm thinking about the economic piece of this correctly, would it be appropriate to include the quip and the cancellation costs minus the guarantee obligations, minus any tax benefits of the write-off, if they rule that all of that has prudently occurred with a net No-go cost? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. You're right on target. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : And then I would need to add in whatever the cost would be for replacement generation and then compare that to the $6.7 billion to $7.4 billion, correct? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, that's one way to go about it. Certainly, those will be factors that we would help present to the Commission and help them in our recommendation. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then I just wanted to verify, it sounded like from SCANA that one factor that drove their decision was the decision of Santee Cooper to not go forward. I just want to verify that your partners are pretty much, they're all together in terms of where you're at on the decision-making process there. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, we work very hard, Georgia Power works very hard as a co-owner. We've had a relationship with these folks for decades and we have a terrific relationship, among and between Oglethorpe and Miag and Dalton, and we work very hard to stay together on these issues and I feel confident we will. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : And then the last thing I wanted to ask about, you mentioned how you continue to see the productivity improvements. I was wondering if you cloud give us a little more granularity and the type of improvements you've been able to achieve and the confidence you have that those would continue if you do decide to go with the Go decision. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, and what we'll do, we're going to have a lot more transparency. Obviously, we had to rely on our turnkey contractor Westinghouse and so we didn't get complete transparency. They had their own books and records, they kept. Now that we've been able to get in the middle of that, we've actually plotted out what we think their productivity rates were versus what we believe we're achieving now and what we think we can achieve. We have washed those assumptions through our external consultants Bechtel, Fluor, others. TVA personnel recently finished a nuclear plant. So we've already seen pretty dramatic improvements. I want to say it was something like 25% improvement this year in productivity and really ramping here, the best improvement has been the most recent improvement, the last four weeks and we'll provide a way to talk to you all our owners, as to how to communicate that productivity performance, obviously, as we're effective on schedule, that certainly has a bearing on being effective on cost and that will have an overall kind of aspect as to our success in hitting these numbers. Our near-term experience tells us that we can do a better job than Westinghouse should we decide to go down that road. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Jonathan, welcome. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Just a quick one, you presented these new numbers on slide eight as preliminary estimates. And I think you also said, Tom, that you expect when you file with the Commission that, instead of being a range of options, it'll be more like I think you said converging on a single point. Should we also expect the estimate to be narrowed in that filing? Or are these the kind of numbers and you're just doing more analysis? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Jonathan. We haven't put together a filing yet. We haven't got a recommendation yet, but to answer the hypothetical, my sense is the single point would be a recommendation that is a dominant belief among us, the co-owners. And I think they won't surprise the Commission, the staff and everything else. Like I say, we have an ongoing kind of conversation about where we're going. It will include now the input of our major contractors. We'll have moved down the road with people like Bechtel, Fluor, however, we decide to construct that relationship. And I think we'll be more refined. I will not be prescriptive on this call, but I would estimate, I'm going to guess that we would still go with a range, but it might be a tighter range. We'll see. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Obviously, I'm probably surprised if the number was outside the range. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That will surprise me. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then can I just to recheck on equity, I think you've said a couple of times that you think equity for Vogtle purposes would be well into the future. I mean, is there a scenario where 2018 looks a bit like 2017? Or is it more likely 2018 looks like 2017 used to look? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: 2018 looks like 2017 used to look because remember, the incremental equity we're talking about is Kemper-related and the additional equity to the plan assuming we do a Go, occurs later. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And does that carry you out into 2019 as well? Or is that a little too fuzzy at this point? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: It could be somewhere in between but we'll update that when we outline our plan going forward. I think it will be a little more clear to everybody. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But the well into the future does probably means beyond 2018 that sounds like it's you are saying. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. And remember Tom talked about exceeding the $5.68 billion, I think, is what we as $1 billion to $1.7 billion over there and we're not going to cross that line until 2019 or 2020. So... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: 2019 or 2020 as we draw on the guarantee... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Incremental needs, we'll be in line with that. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, because 2020 and beyond assuming the guarantee numbers are there. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That was it. Thank you very much, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, sir. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. I just want to thank everybody for the phone call. These have been tumultuous times for us all here and we appreciate you hanging with us through this turbulence, but we are moving through it. We built a plan that I think is robust into the future. The premise of this investment remains a low beta, regular, predictable, sustainable and we're able to, I think, deliver long-term earnings growth with an attractive dividend proposition for years to come. Thanks, everybody. We'll continue to work hard to get the best results possible. We appreciate your attendance. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company second quarter 2017 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Colin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everybody to the Southern Company Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded today, November 1, 2017. Southern Company's Third Quarter Earnings Call will feature slides that are available on our Investor Relations website. You can access the slides at www.investor.southerncompany.com/webcast. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Colin. Welcome to Southern Company's third quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call may be reviewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Our premier, state-regulated electric and gas utilities and Southern Power performed well during the third quarter and they remain on track to deliver on their targets for 2017 on an adjusted basis. Before Art provides a complete overview of our financial results, I'd like to first provide updates on what's happened since our last call. First, for Plant Vogtle. On August 31, Georgia Power filed VCM 17 with the Georgia Public Service Commission, which in line with our co-owners, recommends completion of Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power expects Unit 3 to be in service by November 2021 and Unit 4 to be in service by November 2022 with an estimated total cost for Georgia Power for both units of $8.8 billion. Factoring in expected payments under the Toshiba parent guarantee, the new total net cost of the project is estimated to be $7.1 billion, which is an increase of $1.4 billion over their previous estimate. In the 17th VCM filing, Georgia Power is requesting the PSC to confirm that : one, the revised cost and schedule estimates are reasonable; two, the 2016 prudence stipulation remains in effect; three, the certified cost is not a cap; and four, Georgia Power is not the guarantor of the Toshiba parent guarantee. A schedule for all of the proceedings has been approved and a decision by the PSC is expected in early February 2018. Georgia Power continues to work on mitigating project risks and mitigating the overall cost of the project to its customers. On September 29, Georgia Power received a conditional commitment for an additional $1.67 billion from the Department of Energy to expand the Vogtle 3 and 4 loan guarantee program. Final issuance of the additional loan guarantees is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions and is not expected to occur prior to the end of the first quarter of 2018. Including this commitment, the total loan guarantees are expected to provide more than $500 million in present value benefit to Georgia Power customers. On October 2, Georgia Power and the co-owners received the first and largest payment from Toshiba under its parent guarantee obligation, totaling $300 million of which $137 million is Georgia Power's share. Earlier today, we received the second scheduled payment. While we anticipate Toshiba will fulfill its remaining obligations over the next three-plus years, Georgia Power and the co-owners have been actively evaluating and preparing for the option of monetizing its rights in the remaining Toshiba guarantee payments and its bankruptcy claims against Westinghouse. Any monetization transaction is subject to DoE review and approval under Georgia Power's Loan Guarantee Agreement. We believe the process could be complete before the end of this year, effectively eliminating this risk for the owners and our customers. Turning to construction, the primary success factor for this project going forward will be productivity in the field. Throughout the transaction of the site from Westinghouse control to Southern Nuclear control, productivity trended in the right direction and we have even seen that trend continue in support of the updated schedule. This continued improvement can be attributed to several factors, including improved leadership in the field, improved work package management and continuous monitoring and communication of performance. A contract with Bechtel to serve as the prime construction contractor was finalized two weeks ago and we see another incremental step towards improved site performance. Let's move now to our recent announcement regarding Southern Company Gas. A few weeks ago, Southern Company Gas entered into asset purchase agreement with South Jersey Industries for the utility operating assets of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas. We anticipate closing these transactions by the end of the third quarter of 2018 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total proceeds of $1.7 billion will be used to reduce external financing needs for both Southern Company Gas and Southern Company, and we expect the transaction to support our EPS growth and credit metric objectives. We are gratified to have a buyer like South Jersey Industries, which is committed to providing the same level of outstanding service and reliability that Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas customers are accustomed to receiving today. We believe this is a value-maximizing transaction for all parties involved. I'll turn the call over now to Art for a financial and economic review. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we reported earnings for the third quarter of 2017 of $1.07 per share, compared to earnings of $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we reported earnings of $0.35 per share compared with earnings of $2.40 a share for the same period in 2016. Excluding the charges associated with the Kemper project, Wholesale Gas Services, acquisition and integration costs, as well as other items described in our earnings materials, earnings for the third quarter of 2017 and the nine-month period ended September 2017 were $1.12 per share and $2.51 per share respectively. This compares with $1.27 and $2.62 per share for the same periods in 2016. Major earnings drivers to our adjusted results for the third quarter of 2017 included retail revenue effects at Southern Company's state-regulated electric businesses, offset by milder weather, timing of Southern Power tax credits, increased interest expense and increased shares. As for the earnings estimate for the next quarter, we estimate that we will earn $0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, which would have us at $2.97 per share or just above the middle of our range for the year-end 2017 on an adjusted basis. Moving now to an economic review of the third quarter. Economic growth remains encouraging, both nationally and in our service territories. U.S. has now experienced 83 consecutive months of job growth and employment, and our footprint continues to outpace the national average. The Southern Company system is experiencing strong residential customer growth at a rate of 1%, with the most robust growth occurring in Florida and Georgia. In the commercial sector, we continue to see expansion of square footage across our footprint including office space, warehouses and data centers. Offsetting these positive trends is the ongoing adoption of new technology and energy-efficient equipment and appliances, especially HVAC and lighting, in both the residential and commercial sectors. In addition, the advancement of digital commerce continues to negatively impact prospects for growth in the commercial sector. Nationally, economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in September at the fastest pace in 13 years, and the ISM Manufacturing Index climbed to 60.8, its highest reading since May of 2004. In the Southern Company footprint, we have seen electricity sales increase in primary metals and chemicals, with 6 of our top 10 industrial sectors showing positive momentum. Economic development activity in our service territories has been robust. Daimler has announced plans to expand its Alabama operations with a $1 billion investment in infrastructure and in 600 new jobs at its Global Logistics Center, all of which is expected to support the manufacture of electric SUVs by 2020. In Georgia, the Anthem Technology Center is expected to add 1,800 new IT jobs with the potential for 3,000 jobs over time, and online retailer ASOS will create 1,600 new jobs in its fulfillment center. Looking ahead, we anticipate that the rebuilding and repair work associated by the damage sustained from recent hurricanes should help sustain economic growth in our territories through the end of 2017 and early 2018, and automakers are already reporting higher sales as residents of Texas and Florida replace vehicles destroyed by flooding. Let me now update you on our financing plans for the remainder of 2017 and provide you insights into 2018 and beyond. At our 2016 Analyst Day, we outlined cumulative equity needs of approximately $1.4 billion from 2017 through 2021. Much has changed since last October and our equity needs for the remainder of 2017 and forward continue to evolve. For 2017, while our Kemper charges generated an incremental $1 billion need for equity to rebalance our capital structure, the pending sale of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas as well as the potential monetization of the remaining Toshiba obligation have greatly mitigated that incremental need. Here are a few other key drivers expected to change our equity needs in the future. First, Southern Power secured tax equity for the Cactus Flats wind project announced in July and will likely explore the same financing vehicle for future renewable projects. The use of third-party tax equity is expected to significantly reduce the amount of debt in common equity deployed by Southern Power over the forecast horizon. Moreover, the use of third party tax equity is not expected to diminish Southern Power's contribution to Southern Company's EPS growth. Additionally, we are considering launching a process to sell a minority equity interest in Southern Power's portfolio of solar assets. We are very proud of the leadership position we have taken in utility-scale solar across the U.S., and we continue to view these assets as an integral part of Southern Power and Southern Company. However, we believe this portfolio has tremendous value in the market, considering the quality of long-dated contracts tied to the underlying assets. Selling up to one-third of our interest in the portfolio represents a clear opportunity to extract value from the market and redeploy capital in a manner that further supports our overall financial objectives. We will likely initiate a sale process some time before year-end with a potential closing in mid-2018. The updated cost and schedule for Vogtle 3 and 4 will also have an impact on our longer term financing plans. While the potential monetization of the Toshiba obligation would greatly reduce project risk and mitigate near-term financing needs, it would not have a significant impact on our longer term financing plan. We do, however, expect increased debt and equity needs for Vogtle 3 and 4 as a result of the incremental $1.4 billion of capital costs. Any incremental equity from Vogtle's change in cost and schedule will be part of Georgia Power's retail capital structure. Finally, as we've alluded to in the past, we are actively evaluating opportunities to modernize our basic business operations as our customers' needs evolve. Our objective as always is to improve the way we serve our customers while maintaining affordable prices. We anticipate these initiatives would have the added benefits of strengthening the long-term EPS growth contribution of our state-regulated utilities. These modernization opportunities could increase our long-term funding requirements. We look forward to sharing with you our updated long-term capital and financing plans as well as our long-term EPS growth projections on our fourth quarter call in February. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks Art. In closing, we continue to see Southern Company Gas performing exactly as expected, complementing our outstanding electric operations including our competitive generation subsidiary, Southern Power. In our state jurisdictions, we continue to foster constructive regulatory relationships as evidenced by several positive rate outcomes this year. As we look ahead to 2018 and beyond, we are well positioned to deliver value to our investors over the long-term. Finally, I would be remiss not to mention the catastrophic weather events that occurred during the third quarter, including Hurricane Irma and its impact on customers in our service region especially those in Georgia and Alabama. We experienced roughly 1.7 million outages system-wide that we were able to restore service in less than five days for customers who could accept service. Thanks to the close collaboration and tireless efforts of line crews and staff from all of our operating companies as well as others across the electric utility industry. Prior to that, we were pleased to contribute to efforts to help restore power outside of our own service territory in wake of damage incurred by Hurricane Harvey. Both of these recent restoration efforts represent an unprecedented collaboration between investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities and co-ops, along with tremendous support and cooperation for the United States Government. As a matter of fact, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, was a valued participant in all of our daily teleconferences, offering unfailing help at every opportunity. Thanks once again for joining us this afternoon. We will now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Good afternoon guys. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Hi Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Can I ask some questions with regard to the financing plan? Is the reason why you're not formally updating the plan today, simply sort of trying to give us some direction on puts and takes because we don't know yet about the go, no-go decision on Vogtle and once we get that, you'll be able to sort of lay it out more clearly for us? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes, that, Greg, plus any modernization initiatives that might come about included in the plan or excluded from the plan. There's lots of moving parts yet, so this is just a preview, but we'll give you more to chew on in the next call. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Sale of the minority interest in solar's and the other one. Yeah, we'll have a better idea later. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay, right. Because you guys had said relative to Kemper, that you needed a $1 billion of equity this year, but you never said you needed a $1 billion of common stock. You just needed to find a $1 billion of cash, right? So the Elizabethtown deal, that's not going to close till late next year so that's not part of what you need now, but the third-party tax equity, the minority interest sale, the monetization bringing some cash forward from Toshiba, all those things could theoretically severely limit or even maybe eliminate the need for common equity in the short run, right? Or wrong? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: You're correct. We think we can eliminate the need in the short run. The monetization will actually equal itself out over time, but it will certainly help in the short run. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. That was my main question, guys. Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: You're welcome. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Angie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: How are you? I never ask M&A questions, but I will this time around. So, okay. So just bear with me, okay? So you are pursuing your construction of your project in Georgia, the nuclear project. There will be some lessons learned from it. You, for now, have the 5% earnings growth objective, which could go higher and why not attempt to grow those earnings through an acquisition in South Carolina? You are better positioned than anybody else to potentially offer continued construction of this V.C. Summer project, maybe not now, but in the future, applying some lessons learned from the Vogtle construction. You have an incredible operation track record. There is a utility there that needs help, so just talk me through why that would not be a rational course of events for you guys? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Angie, thanks for the question. Look, I mean you've known us for decades, I bet. You can't really comment on any specific opportunity. As with Elizabethtown, as with AGL, we really pay attention to those being both a disciplined seller and buyer. We use roughly the same kind of threshold, et cetera. And so we'll apply that logic wherever we look and you know that we have an active radar screen. As I've said before in many different earnings calls, and one-on-ones and everything else, these deals are extraordinarily hard to get done. In order to balance the different objectives, first of customers, then of the companies and all the other external public, any attempt like this is a bit of a long putt. Certainly, time will tell, but I think that's probably my best answer right now. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: There's so many \u2013 especially there, there are so many moving pieces, it's just hard to see through them right now. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Understood. And my second question is, so I understand that there is \u2013 you have partners at the Vogtle project and the DoE needs to opine on the monetization of the Toshiba securitization, Toshiba proceeds. Is that the reason why it's taking longer than what we saw with SCANA? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. As a normal course of financing, that the Toshiba guarantee is a part of the security package, underlying the DoE loan guarantees. And so we have to get a approval of essentially a change in the security package, not only for the existing loans outstanding, but anything new in the new commitment by DoE. OMB has a say in that and it's just taking some time for OMB to process a change in the security package. My belief is that they will get there and we will get this done. It's just taking a little bit of process. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey. Good call. I guess, there still are open regulatory matters in Mississippi. If there were to be any further disallowances as were recommended by some of the intervener parties in that proceeding, should shareholders expect that you would infuse additional equity into Mississippi Power, or is that off the table? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We pretty much said consistently that we're going to protect the financial integrity of Mississippi Power along the way. We'll see what unfolds. The process right now though, Paul, and everybody should understand, in a very painful way, we've taken the gasifier off the table. What's remaining to be evaluated under this rate process is a combined cycle asset that has been delivering round numbers about one-third of the energy to the customers in Mississippi Power, has had a reliability circumstance that is something less than 1% of equivalent outage rate where industry averages maybe three times or more times that. So this is a terrific asset, an economic asset and we expect to be treated fairly. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: And then sort of as a follow-up on that, I mean, under what circumstances would you potentially consider selling Mississippi Power, if any? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, I think I answered that question with Angie's question too, Paul. Listen, in representing the interest of shareholders, we try to be exceedingly disciplined whether we buy or sell, and that goes to companies, that goes to assets, that goes to everything we do. So taking all that into account, what is the best mix of Southern Company assets for the benefit of our long-term growth rate, our risk return profile, ultimately inuring to the benefit of shareholders. That's just the best way to leave that question, I think. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, Tom. How are you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Michael. How are you? Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Hey, do you have any indication as to how the monetization of the payments would be treated by regulators? Is this going to be a refund? Are they looking for refunds? Or are they going to allow you to keep it on the balance sheet and help finance the project? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: We've had discussions with regulators, but there's been no finalization of that. What we would recommend is that they apply it to the construction work in progress balance and that would provide for a rate reduction in their NCCR rate, which would benefit customers in the short run and will accrue AFUDC once we pass this $4.4 billion benchmark. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. The fact that the DoE loan guarantees have this as one of their provisions, does that prevent regulators from trying to even attempt to refund it to customers in some way? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Don't believe so. I think those would all be independent. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. All right. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, you know the Georgia Commission has had a long track record of constructive regulation for the long-term benefit of customers. I think they'll follow that practice. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to just explore the potential for further cost cutting at the different utility businesses. When we look at the cost structure in some of your utilities, did you see you have some potential there? But I'm just curious, I imagine that's an ongoing thing that you all think about, but is there anything specific that could be under way or that you could be thinking about further in terms of further cutting O&M cost at your utility businesses? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Stephen, I think we should think about a better way to put those actions in context. We call this our modernization plan and largely, what we're doing is displacing O&M with capital. Why is that? What we're able to do now, we've been employing a business model for 100 years or more in the Southeast and what we see are opportunities now because technology is enabling it and because certain customers are requiring it, we're thinking about how to displace a historical practice, for example, in Georgia, being in every small town in the state with perhaps a more modern way to connect with customers. Interestingly, while we have reduced our local office physical presence in the state of Georgia, we have expanded our points of presence with customers, largely through technology. I think almost four times, I think that's about the right number. And interestingly also, we were very uncertain as to the effect that these changes may have in our customer base. I think last year, Georgia Power was named the most trusted utility in America and so we think those kinds of changes have helped. That's kind of in the customer-facing business. We're also evaluating changes in our generating fleet. Now, we have a long-term plan that speaks to kind of a transition between now and say, 2050, to the low to no carbon future that thinks about, what do we believe about nuclear, what do we believe about coal, the importance of natural gas infrastructure and renewables, and so you continue to see us exercise the latest thinking on technology improvements to our operation. The final thing I will say is this business model of making, moving and selling energy up to a meter and then having kind of a relationship where the customer does something with the energy on the other side of the meter and sends us a check every month, is changing. And that is, we have created, I think, a very important, but rather small, at least at this point, option with PowerSecure where in effect, we're taking some small steps what I would call creative destruction. That is creating the make, move and sell on the customer premises, allowing customers more control and we're doing this largely in areas that aren't in the Southeast. In other words, in the Southeast, we provide customers with the very best reliability, the lowest prices and the best service again in the United States. Once again, I think our top five utilities in customer satisfaction were our five utilities including Southern in that. And I think that's giving us another opportunity to think about the advent of technology in displacing what otherwise has been, what I would call, traditional service. We continue to seek ways \u2013 as Art mentioned, earlier in response to, I think it was Michael's call, but it was the idea of thinking more and more about how our CapEx budget may be impacted by these modernization efforts, along with that, in order to keep \u2013 because every time you add CapEx, that does an increase to the customer bill, we're going to try and make reductions in O&M to keep customer bills indifferent and still provide better reliability, better cost, better service. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Stephen, one other comment in that regard, if you look at our consolidated as-reported earnings, it shows a pretty hefty increase in non-fuel O&M year-over-year, on a year-to-date basis, but most of that increase is due to the inclusion of Southern Gas, which was not in last year's year-to-date number. So if I look at the electric operating companies' same period, they're down almost 6% year-over-year. So, there are a lot of moving parts in that regard. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And let me throw one more idea. We've done this in years past, haven't talked about it in my recent memory. We have this program in place where we include optionality into our spending. And so recall this year, I want to say this quarter, Art, we had $0.10 of weather year-over-year that was negative. In other words, yes, this year's weather in the third quarter was reasonably normal, but last year, it was exceedingly hot. And I think year-to-date, it was something like $0.23, $0.26, what was it? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: $0.23. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: $0.23. We've been able to maintain our earnings through effective cost management. So I guess, and I'm describing these, there are kind of tactical changes and what I was describing earlier are kind of strategic changes in our cost structure. We've demonstrated year over year, over year, and if you look at almost any company, our actual performance compared to our guidance, we almost always hit it, we can't guarantee that for the future, but if you look at our track record, Southern Company is one of the most predictable and reliable earnings performers in the industry. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very, very helpful. And then just shifting over to Vogtle, I was thinking just about the Bechtel involvement here, and in the case of SCANA, SCANA had an independent assessment done of the project. Have you all engaged any independent assessments of the project? Or has it really just been part of the core team that has been developing the budget, i.e., is there an outside party that's been taking a separate look? Or is it really just been the entire project team sort of together, if that makes sense? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Absolutely, yeah. No along the way, I won't speak to SCANA's issues. Our issues are very clear and that is, we've had Dr. Bill Jacobs, who is the independent monitor for the staff, the commission in Georgia. He's a terrific guy. He's had complete access to everything that we've done. He sits in the meetings with us. Gosh, I mean, all along the way, we've been exceedingly transparent with the commission and through him, with us and the staff as to all of the issues, whether they are cost, whether they are schedule going forward, everything has been on the table really through all of these VCM processes and it's easy, go look at the testimony. Further, as we went through this decision of whether to go, no-go, we've had lots of independent evaluations. We wanted to really cover this kind of idea soup to nuts, and so we've had a firm called Kenrich involved. PwC made an independent assessment. And of course, Fluor and Bechtel both made independent assessments. The Bechtel assessment ultimately has provided the foundation upon which we have a new commercial relationship where they have significant fees at risk. So, I think we've been, A, exceedingly transparent; and B, we've used that information not only in the past, but using it in the future to create, I think, an effective commercial relationship. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful, thanks. That's all I had. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yep, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, Tom. Good afternoon. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question. I just wanted to be clear as you laid out on slide 16. When you're looking at the equity for this year versus the original $575 million, looks like we will end up at $750 million. Is that accurate, am I reading that right? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's correct. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And so then again, from a high-level perspective, you laid out the various things that have moved around, the asset sales, potential monetization, et cetera. When you put it all together, I mean is it fair to say the message is that net-net, your needs are likely less than what you were previously thinking or is that not fair to think? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I think near-term, we have certainly \u2013 as we've said before, near-term, they are a lot less than what we had outlined on our last call. But as you go through time, especially related to the increased cost associated with Vogtle, the potential increase in modernization efforts, which are all part of our upcoming plan that we'll talk more about in February. So, yeah, there's lot of moving parts, but I think you're getting the gist of it. And all that slide was intended to do is to let you know that there's a lot of stuff going on. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, but those big gas utility sales, the monetization of part of the solar portfolio, the tax equity, these were again, I think, things that you had not been pushing for earlier. So even with the Vogtle increase and with the modernization, it just seems that there's more cash coming in, but maybe that's not the case. I just wanted to be clear if that was (38:51) Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It is clear. There is more cash coming in. I think the other thing that we need to make very clear is that when we think about any marginal equity increases in the future, the vast majority of them will be associated with this modernization effort in the operating companies, so those will represent additions for regulated investments. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And on a separate note, looking at the trends in your weather-normalized sales, you're down 1.3% in the third quarter, but down 1% year-to-date, versus your expectation, but still flat to slightly up for the year. Just wondering how your thoughts have changed both near-term and long-term when you're thinking about your weather-normalized load outlook? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, I think this year is partially explained, at least in the quarter, by the hurricane, which you could technically call it weather, but we don't pull that out specifically and residential weather normal sales were down 2%. I think some of that was influenced by the hurricane and the outages associated with that. Industrially, it's not been as strong as we thought it would be, but we expect that the momentum for the rest of this year and into 2018 will be stronger. So that number could improve by year-end. When we think about our long-term forecast, we're still kind of in the low \u2013 we always say, I think last year, 0 to 1%, but right now, I think for 2017, we had estimated 0.3%. And we'll update you on our new forecast in our plan in February. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, and those of you that are into the trivia, during the storm we lost in Georgia 9% of our load; for the month 2.2%; for the quarter 0.7%. So that kind of gives you the magnitude of the storm effects. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Last question. Tom, also wanted to clarify, you were talking about some tactical moves you can make on O&M as storm and other costs come in. Should we view those as temporary, one-time in nature? Is there a permanency attached to that? Or how should we think about the O&M cost increase off the 2017 base going forward? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Ali, we've been doing this really going back \u2013 I mean, I started this back when I was CFO of Mississippi Power, for heaven sakes, but we call it our flexible budgeting system where we identify things that we just have to do, we identify things that we want to do, and then if we had, for example, favorable weather, higher revenues, these are things that we would tee up and only do if we have the opportunity to do them. So we actually kind of fourth-rank O&M and we have a sense of priority over time. And really, since I've been CFO of Southern, so now that goes back, gosh, a decade or more, we do this comprehensively across the system. And it's enabled us in a very kind of sensible, orderly way where we get biggest bang for the buck to be able to handle variations in the economy and in weather. And we do that up to a confidence level and it's worked exceedingly well. Interestingly, with the gives and takes of weather, some years are hotter and some years aren't, we're able to satisfy what we think is a normalized O&M spending over a period of time. So some years it's up, some years it's down, and overall we've been able to deliver the results we need. And the demonstration of that is this reliability we have, the customer satisfaction we have, and the fact that we maintain low rate through this period. It's been exceedingly, exceedingly beneficial. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, sir, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, Tom. Thank you guys for taking my question. One on Vogtle and then one on the gas business. On Vogtle, you've still got multiple years of construction left before you complete the project. Whether it be a project management or be it your contract with Bechtel or others, how do you protect Georgia Power and Georgia Power's partners from continuing to have even more project delays and even more cost inflation on the project? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, number one, a lot of the variance in the estimate is already taken out. In other words, 95% of the equipment is already on-site. We have a healthy contingency included in the estimate, not only in cost contingency but also schedule contingency. We have incentive structures in the commercial relationship with Bechtel. I think Bechtel has given us an improved productivity set of metrics, which are all showing us since we've taken over the site from Westinghouse and Fluor that they're all headed in the right direction. And that is based on a schedule that calls for six months of contingency. So, in other words, if you think about it, the filing we're making, it's kind of a 29-month schedule extension. We're providing our own metrics for kind of a 23-month; therefore, a six-month contingency schedule. All of those things right now are pointing in the right direction. The real key to our success going forward and being able to hit these numbers really is going to go to commodity type of equipment and wire and pipes and stuff like that, but most importantly, the efficiency of labor at the site. The other thing I'll just say is that this company, me personally, have had a terrific relationship with Sean McGarvey over the years. The U.S. Building Trades has been a terrific partner in executing Vogtle 3 and 4. They were enormous supporters of ours through this very turbulent period with Westinghouse, and I think they understand that their ability to execute in a favorable way is critical to our overall success. And I believe that everything they can do to help in that endeavor will be done. So if you line up kind of commercial incentives, improved metrics, the type of work, the kind of cooperation we're having with the skilled labor on-site, I think we're feeling pretty good, but those are kinds of big variables. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And when you think about the commercial metrics, and I don't recall what you put in the public domain on this, is it simply there's upside for Bechtel to finish the project on time and either on budget or even below budget, or is there sharing in the downside where if there are incremental project cost creeps due to inflation or just being able to execute a challenging project schedule is there downside for them where they share in the downside along with Georgia Power, Oglethorpe, and the other owners? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Michael, no. We think we've taken good estimate that allow for plenty of contingency. Their incentive is essentially half of their fee that is tied to both cost and schedule performance. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. I want to change topic a little bit to the gas midstream business. I mean, it's been a while since you bought half of SONAT from Kinder, and just curious about whether you're seeing offshoot opportunities now that you've had that exposure, and obviously since you've had AGL for a little bit of time as well, are you seeing offshoot opportunities in the Southeast where there's a potential need for it to move incremental gas, and it requires a midstream solution and you might be well positioned to partake in that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So we have looked at some other things. We continue to get those questions. Gas infrastructure is another one of the so-called prominent solutions with the technology revolution provided by directional drilling and fracking and when you just look at the energy values, it looks as if gas is going to be around for a long, long time. And then we're seeing these kind of new opportunities we've done with Bloom, which is a gas feed. We have looked at some other gas pipelines in Georgia that we can speak to, but so far the kind of big interstate efforts, they haven't hit our thresholds. We did have a placeholder in the original SONAT obligations. It was over $200 million. I want to say $240 million or so that dealt with an expansion to the Southern Natural Gas system through Fairburn, Georgia. So we've done that. We have expanded even beyond our initial investment. Southern Gas already has their own kind of projects underway, and we're executing on those. The big other ones are kind of still out there and I think people are still trying to figure out how to get them done. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. And the only reason I asked that question is now that one of the major nuclear projects doesn't look like it's going to go forward in South Carolina, it seems that that's a state that's going to start utilizing a lot more gas-fired generation than maybe it previously had and it's had a lot of very, very strong gas LDC demand over the last two to three years, two to four years. And at some point, there will come a need to move gas in the South Carolina. And it strikes me, you're one of the three opportunities to do it. Either SONAT goes further east or Transco has an incremental lateral or ACP comes down. I just didn't know if it's premature and kind of the cycle of all these things to even be thinking about stuff like that. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Michael, that's a fascinating question and the way that we prefer to think about that is kind of as a region, how do we think this moves? Thinking about that question and its implication for just South Carolina may not be the optimal answer. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciate it. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking our call. I just want to \u2013 on equity, your slide says the near-term needs are greatly mitigated and I think in Greg's question, you kind of endorsed the word eliminated or even said it, but does near-term mean 2018, or is it just 2017? It strikes me, you've kind of done the equity you were planning in 2017. So presumably it means 2018, but I want to make sure I'm right on that. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. There are some details yet that have to be filled in and we'll give you on the next call, but I think you're thinking about it right. 2017 and then a lot of 2018 will be mitigated as well. We'll just have to wait and see until all the moving parts kind of settle down a little bit. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Art. And then ... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And that source of equity and CapEx on the other side, we continue on the modernization efforts that are core to utilities. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's right. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. And then just as we tie these things together, I mean, you obviously withdrew the slide you had last quarter that showed the step-down for Kemper but then the 5% growth that you reiterated. Assuming that you're still \u2013 and then it was suggested in another question that you're pointing to the same, that or higher. Just you didn't say anything to that. I was just curious whether you're endorsing that concept or... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, we are where we were. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We are where we were, Jonathan. We're still on a 5% long-term trajectory. Of course, we'll update all this in the \u2013 whatever it is, the early February call next year. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just finally on Vogtle, thank you for the productivity metrics that you're showing. It's very helpful, but can you give us a little insight sort of behind that summary number? Are there some subsets of that or do they all look similar or anything you can provide some extra color there? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, I think, Jonathan... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I think you said... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I think you want to focus on where our critical path issues are and I think you would define that as the power block. That would be the nuclear island and the turbine building, and that's where we'll focus most keenly on productivity because those are the most important aspects of the unit in order to meet the schedules that we've outlined. And right now, we're on goal with all those metrics, but you're right, there are different approaches to different aspects of construction around the site. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And it's a fascinating question as we sit through every two weeks or so in these project meetings. A lot of improving the pace of work is involved with opening up different work fronts. And if you look at our site compared, for example, to other sites, you will see kind of broader expansion, which will ultimately help us in a variety of fronts, not only just putting concrete and rebar and iron on the ground, but also in the regulatory process as we kind of streamline (53:30) and a variety of other things. So Art's right. I think the critical path for us right now is the nuclear island, but we're opening up a great deal of flexibility by moving on these other fronts, and that provides us a great deal of flexibility going forward in maintaining schedule. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, and to make sure I understand the metric on slide six and your comment just before that it includes contingency. So if you were to hold that metric around 1, you'd effectively bring the plant on six months early. Is that ...? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's a 23-month schedule, that's right. And round numbers, fellows, correct me here, but I think if we were to bring it on in 29 months, this is around a 1.4 metric. So if you're below 1.4, you're not eating into any sort of contingency. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you, Tom. All right. And I guess just finally, I think weren't we supposed to hear about the fire up of the Sanmen AP1000 by now? I was curious if you guys have any insight into what may or may not be going on there? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Jonathan. We know of no real technical reason why they haven't loaded fuel. We can only surmise that it's just governmental approvals that they are waiting on. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Jonathan, excuse me, let me just be very clear. 1.4 is equal to a 29-month schedule, 1.0 is equal to a 23-month schedule. If you're in between 1 and 1.4, that means you're in between 23 months and 29 months. I hope that's obvious, but just want to be very clear. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hey, how is it going? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Great. So just quickly here. On Vogtle, it seems that there's a little bit more of a focus on the co-owners. I think they're going to be testifying at the hearing coming up. And I don't recall that and maybe I just missed it. So let me know if \u2013 is that unusual or is that a change? And could you just sort of maybe describe sort of the \u2013 there seems to be more of a focus in terms of the data requests, et cetera. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate what might be going on? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, listen, this is one of the most important projects in Georgia's economic history. And it was very clear to us, as we've been working through the challenges and now the opportunities available going forward, that we needed to be arm-in-arm. It's interesting. We do have a shared interest : the co-ops, the munis, City of Dalton, and Georgia Power in seeing this thing through the right way. And I think that's what that's a reflection of is really a joint interest in a participation. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Okay. And moving on, let me ask you this. Do you think there's any possibility that we'll get a settlement in this deflated VCM? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It's always possible. I've said that before in response to questions about settlements with Georgia's triennial filings, boy, always possible. But it's a great practice, some might say therapeutic practice to allow the process to continue and unfold. It allows everybody a seat at the table. Everyone's voice is relevant to be heard. I think we'll get the right conclusion whether we settle or not. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Okay. And then on grid modernization, this comes as sort of interesting. I'm just wondering if you could sort of comment on perhaps the size of the potential grid modernization that you might be thinking about and the nature and perhaps if there's any tie-in with O&M there, just sort of what you guys are thinking about there and what might be the factors that lead you to go for that or not? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, they're directly linked to each other. To the degree we identify additional opportunities there, we'll have to identify the O&M that goes along with it from a timing perspective in order to minimize the impacts on rates. So one will lead to the other. We have not outlined size at this point, Paul. We will give you more detail on that on our next call. We're not quite through with our process yet. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. There's a comprehensive effort across the system to figure out how and when to do these different initiatives. Stan Connally, currently CEO at Gulf Power is kind of leading that on behalf of all the CEOs, but I can tell you all the CEOs head different parts of this initiative. It's a really kind of exciting thing. It's a way to modernize the company. And recall, this is really being driven by market changes, both in technology and customer requirements. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. But I mean, when we think about this, is there any type of technological deployment that sort of stands out? Or is it just a whole bunch of things? And what I meant about O&M, you were talking before about how capital business can save on O&M. And I'm just wondering whether or not we have any sense as to whether or not some of this might pay for itself or sort of anything like that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Sure. Gosh, yeah. And in fact, the whole objective here is to deploy the technology CapEx. I gave the example earlier of kind of reducing physical locations in small towns with a manifold increase in points of presence to customers, making it easier for customers to do business with us and actually improving as a result their satisfaction and ultimately their trust in the company. It really is a modernization as to how we approach the marketplace, but as you can imagine, this modernization goes into internal systems as well, not only generation and transmission and distribution, but even kind of supply chain, human resource, a variety of the so-called administrative areas. We're really pushing this notion of how can we modernize our operation and improve it for customers. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Kamal. Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon, gentlemen. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Terrific. Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Had a couple of questions. Looking at the potential asset sales that you're evaluating, would you say that market value is at a fair premium to book value? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's hard to answer. I mean it depends on the asset. It was certainly fair in Elizabethtown. Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And even with the solar portfolio, I guess, given the yieldco demand and the financial investor demand, it seems like that would be the case, is that not? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, we believe so. There are investors out there, we think they're looking for passive kind of deployment of capital into 20-year average life assets, very predictable, high-quality kind of cash flows coming off of that. So we think there's value in the marketplace. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We think those kinds of structures have immense more value than say, a solar asset dependent upon an organized market. Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then looking at machinations in your equity issuance. I understand the near-term needs to be mitigated, but looking longer term, where do you see yourself from an FFO to debt perspective at the holding company? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, we target that overall of our OpCo, so I think over the longer term, we certainly can achieve that target. That's the stake we have put in the ground in order to achieve and the use of proceeds from these asset sales. We'll eliminate some equity need, but we'll also reduce debt as well to maintain our progress towards those targets. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And the target coverage ratio, we're aiming at? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: 16% FFO to debt. Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the time. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Ashar, glad to have you. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Hi. How are you guys doing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Tom, Art, I wanted to go back to, I don't know if you can remind us some of these moving parts. The detriment from Kemper that was $0.08 to $0.10 that you had provided on the last slide in the second quarter call. Could you remind us what that was made up of? How did you come up with that number? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, it was a piece of the fact that we no longer would have an earning asset related to the Kemper project, and the additional equity need that it would create from the write-off. So I don't have the splits for you, but I think we could get them to you. $0.05 to $0.06 I think was the earning asset and then another $0.03 to $0.04 for the equity. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's the round numbers. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Those are rough. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Okay. So now with the equity need being alleviated through some other mechanisms that we have come up with, does that make that $0.08 to $0.10 now of a lower drag as we look forward or no? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: No. I still think it's still the best approach towards our earnings guidance for 2018 going forward. It's still an early assessment yet. And we'll clear that up certainly in the next call, but it's still our best guess as to where we see ourselves going and what we're trying to achieve over the longer term. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Certainly gives us more flexibility with respect to changes in EPS growth and credit metrics. Our idea is to balance that, maintain our long-term commitment to shareholders. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Okay. Thank you so much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Andy. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Hi, guys. How you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Great. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Good. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Just a couple questions. And this, maybe I should know but I don't. On the asset sales, whether it's the solar or Elizabethtown or whatever else you may end up selling, is there any tax leakage on that, or basically, for whatever you sell it, because of NOLs or write-offs or whatever, that all goes into your pocket? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Actually on Elizabethtown, we expect there will be a taxable gain, but oddly enough, it could result in a slight book loss, which is kind of odd, but that has to do with a lot of... Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : That's not cash, right? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: The accretion. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Goodwill. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Goodwill. Excuse me. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Right. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: And then, of course, it depends on what happens whether we do a transaction with the solar assets or not, but more than likely that would result in a tax gain as well. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And recall, since we're in an NOL, any taxes due are deferred. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Right. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay, so you will be able... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It's free for a period of time. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : ...to receive cash. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : All right. Okay, so in the short run, next couple of years, that's all cash kind of in the door... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's it. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : ...for your use. That was my question. And then... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: But a good time to ... Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : On that one, and then just thinking about kind of what you've been doing recently with various cash raises. Is one way to think about this, again, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but obviously you're talking about grid mod and we're going to get a revised CapEx forecast in the fourth quarter, but are you kind of getting rid of assets that are maybe not earning the same type of return that you would be able to earn on the regulated side, and so we probably should expect some type of significant cap raise and this is a way to redeploy the capital? Or am I getting ahead of myself on that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, we always look at who's the best owner of any asset, and that goes to whether we buy it or sell it, right? So we always kind of take, and that should be viewed as a long-term look, okay? That's not a tactical thing. And we always also are very mindful of our impact with all the external publics that we face. So for example, when we even considered Elizabethtown, and like I said, on the day that we announced the AGL Resources merger, I got calls. So that was always an attractive asset in the market for a variety of folks. So as we think about going forward, it's going to be the combined math of all that. It really is kind of opportunistic, where do we think we are going to be in the next 5 to 10 years with that asset. Where will somebody else be? And remember, that's not just returns, that's risk and return. Value accretes to a function of risk and return. If we can reduce risk and improve returns, that's a home run. That's what we're trying to do, is just balance the portfolio. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : So really, it has nothing to do with some future CapEx opportunities at the utilities? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. I thought maybe it would be, okay. And then my final question basically has to do with, when you give 2018 guidance and, again, don't want to get ahead of myself there too, but that will be off of \u2013 that's 5% where you reiterated. Will that be off of 2017's earnings or is there potentially some type of small rebase because of Kemper or something like that and then it would be off of that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, exactly. I mean the math that we've shown before, you take 2017, you grow it 5%, reduce $0.08 to $0.10, grow that at 5% forever. That's kind of (1:08:38). Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Hey, Tom. Just one question on the \u2013 I guess, it ties in with the growth rate, but also with the Vogtle monetization and Toshiba monetization. Just you have this ROE reset thing that in 2021 for a period until the units are up. Can monetization in some way help address that and just how are you going to deal with that in like a growth rate, are you not going to look out to that period? Because it's temporary anyway. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Our 5% long-term growth rate, it depends on how that resolves itself. Whether those two units are treated the same way or whether you split them or how you deploy the cash. There's a few moving pieces in all that, but any consequence of, if we keep the settlement as is and we travel through, you will have just a brief divot in 2021 and 2022 , but you're back to the 5% when those things clear to in-service. It just looks like a year or two of underperforming against the 5%. But they clear to service, you're right back at the 5%. Our long-term growth rate is 5%. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just is there a way that if you're able to get some of the money and kind of delay getting above that cost cap that you could limit this period. I mean obviously if you get the plants up sooner, that limits the period but... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: There is no cost cap per se. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. It's all just based on timing. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's correct. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. Hey, Steve, the other thing. I just want to be very clear about on this 5% and all that. We have been increasing dividends in a regular, predictable and sustainable way and that's because we believe in our long-term growth rate and even with the challenges that (1:10:54) at Kemper County, we increased the rate of growth from $0.07 to $0.08. We are setting our \u2013 of course, this is ultimately the purview of the board, but ultimately our dividend policy is set on a belief of the long-term 5% trajectory, so any kind of one year deviation due to a regulatory construct won't have an impact per se on our long-term dividend strategy. And that ultimately is what drives value. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just, I'm curious, maybe you talked about this upfront, tax reform. I'd be curious to kind of your view given you are so close to it. How you're feeling about the outcome coming out in a way that like some of the utility sector issues are addressed the right way, I guess particularly the bonus and interest deduction. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. So let me first say that Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady had been terrific in really pushing this thing forward and certainly we've met with all the folks in the Senate. We understand and gotten the support in the White House. Here's my best guess. It's worth a cup of coffee or whatever, but let me be parochial. Production tax credit. I believe that there is unanimity in Congress in the House and ultimately in the Senate. I believe we'll get treated fairly and we will get either the timeline moved or eliminated for production tax credits for Vogtle. Now stepping out of my parochialism, for the industry, I think we will follow what was done in 1986 and that is I believe that we will not be accorded expensing of CapEx for public utility property as was originally defined back in 1986. And we will follow some \u2013 what we came up with back then was ACRS \u2013 but some ratable depreciation schedule for taxes kind of as we have now. And in exchange for that, we will retain the ability to deduct interest. That's where I believe we'll go out. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So it's kind of a carve-out for the utility industry... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Which has existed since... Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : ...to reflect its unique rate-making. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. And it's been a very sensible kind of engagement with Congress and these guys have been terrific in listening. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Do you think the House will... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I'm sorry. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Will the House come out with that you think since this will be our first look at the bill. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, let's see. I mean I'm guessing right now, but I think it will. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: They're giving us a big benefit. Look I get the benefit of expensing CapEx. It's just that our deployment of long-term capital is dependent largely upon generation and transmission and environmental expansion plans. We don't sway those one year or another based on tax benefits for heaven's sake. Those are really put in place over decades really. However the elimination of interest deductibility has an immediate negative impact on customers' cost of energy, so they're giving us a benefit with capital expensing that really isn't a benefit and they're hurting customers in the near-term. Especially energy bills tend to be the most kind of regressive form of tax. So the trade actually pays for itself. Let's keep on the tax depreciation schedule for CapEx and let's retain interest deductibility. Congress gets that and it's really important for the most capital intensive industries in the world. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello. Thank you for joining us. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thank you and thank you for the marathon session, so appreciate it. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Always happy. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. So the tax reform point was actually very helpful color and perspective. Just wanted to understand that if what you're saying plays out, and basically it's an interest or tax rate deduction or tax rate comes down, right, let say it comes down from 35% to 20%, the deductibility of interest expense at the holding company that tax shield will also then effectively come down? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: What does that mean for Southern, like are you looking at the holding company debt right now, and are you evaluating this \u2013 I saw in your plan you actually increased by $500 million the holding company debt. So wanted to just figure out how you're thinking about holding company debt given the tax reform and given the tax rates might actually come down. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, look it's a simultaneous equation. I mean, you've centered in on some important stuff. But boy it goes to greater net income because more of it or less of it is subject to taxes. Overall, we believe this is a fair trade for the whole industry including Southern. The other thing that's an impact to us is any sort of carry forward position or unused tax credit position gets extended with a lower tax rate but we've factored every bit of this into our financial plan. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you, and fair enough. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: The other issue around the debt is junior subordinated debt, which will add some equity characteristics to it, from a rating agency perspective it's more friendly. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks. So, it will help you with your FFO to debt targets as well? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yep. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And also in terms of the sale of this minority interest of solar projects, wanted to understand were you referencing that the sale price you potentially could get for the one-third interest sale would be higher than effectively your purchase prices for the same assets or have market prices been about the same? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, hey, you know what, we had a huge argument internally about this. We've all agreed, we're going to let the market kind of dictate what prices are. We really would prefer not to get into any sort of market valuation of where that may get. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's right. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We'll know soon enough. So thank you for your patience there. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, that's fine. And then just finally on that point when you get the proceeds, is there any plan to pay down part of the debt for the projects associated that are being sold. So, if you're selling let's say one-third of a project, is one-third of the debt going to be paid down as well or is the debt going to stay at the full level? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, we finance even at Southern Power, we finance on a portfolio basis. So they've got 45% equity ratio. We would use proceeds to reduce debt and equity. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And you got to understand the way we finance Southern Power is apart from say project financing, it's a much simpler approach and gives us a lot more flexibility than say a project finance structure. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Well, thanks so much guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Julien, how are you? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Hello? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, let's talk quickly here \u2013 I'd love to hear little bit more about the monetization here on the Southern Power side. Do you have any metrics that you might want to think about? I mean, you all talk about net income historically, but I suppose in the other side of the world we talk CAFD, we talk EBITDA. Any kind of sense initially on how to try to size this up? I know we're early days on this, but maybe kind of a consolidated basis, take a one-third of whatever metric you want to talk about? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, I think, Julien, the way we like to talk about it is we think there could be up to 26 solar projects included in this. There may be as much as 1,700 megawatts and these are 20-year average contract lives. We just think that the cash flows for a passive investor, there's lots of interest in that, and that's kind of the target that we've outlined here. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And the other thing is, yes, we do talk net income because that translates directly into EPS, which translates directly into the stock value. We stay away from cash metrics. We tried to do something that's easy for people to value and if you look at Southern Power's track record, historically, they regularly beat their internal objectives. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Should we think about... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: As they did this year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Absolutely. Let me check with you on this, I mean, is there something to be said about perhaps an acceleration on this business given the confidence or should we be thinking about this as kind of taking down the expectations thereby and sort of linearly saying, I'm going to sell down a chunk of this business and we'll swap that out with earnings elsewhere? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We'll go through this in detail in the next earnings call, but what you should expect is that Southern Power will contribute its previous share of EPS growth that it has all along. There is not at all an increase or a reduction. We are keeping exactly with the plan that we laid out in October of 2016 in terms of EPS, contribution to Southern Company. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: And our intent of selling this portion of solar assets is a one-time thing. There is no ongoing right that we would like to offer to that owner to buy future additions to the solar portfolio. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Coming back to this earnings question. Obviously, the gas storage assets have value to them. Maybe not necessarily reflected in kind of a traditional net income metric. How do you think about that part of the overall gas business? I mean is that ultimately in the long-term core, if it doesn't turn around and what are the prospects for this across your specific storage footprint? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We don't think it's significant to our earnings picture, is the short answer. Hasn't been, don't think it will be. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, fair enough. Actually, and then maybe, if I could try to summarize a little bit of what folks have been asking the last, almost hour-and-a-half here, can you give us a little bit of a sense of the big positives and negatives in terms of the cash flows that you're looking at against the equity need that you'd originally articulated? Because you are obviously talking a lot about cash raise here, and not necessarily talking about big uses of cash outside of novel modernization program. Can you just maybe try to summarize that a little bit for us? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. I mean, I don't know, I mean the pluses are the fact that we were opportunistic in the market. We found a terrific buyer for Elizabethtown, and like I said, we had interest in that well before we had any equity need that Art started talking about. So that was really a culmination of a series of discussions over time. Southern Power, using tax equity, certainly has an impact on our equity needs going forward and we're able to maintain our EPS contribution to the overall 5% growth rate of Southern along the way. The other thing is the sale of minority interest of the Southern Power solar portfolio, it's certainly another cash raise that will be I think interesting to us. The monetization, as Art said before, the Toshiba guarantee, is really a time issue. In other words, we would have gotten that over 3-plus years, now we'll get it in a lump sum. So that's just timing. In terms of equity needs, I think it's whatever's associated to support the credit metrics and Mississippi Power associated with Kemper. Whatever we end up with approving with the Georgia Public Service Commission on Vogtle 3&4, and then the increases in CapEx and decreases in O&M associated with this business modernization plans in the OpCos. We will add all those pieces up, the puts and the takes, and have them in the financial plan first quarter next year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you all very much. Really appreciate it. Good luck. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Thanks for joining us. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Your line is open. Please go ahead with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Dan, thanks for joining us. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Good afternoon. So most of mine have been answered, but I have just a couple more around Vogtle. In particular, one, I was wondering given the hornet's nest that's been stirred up in South Carolina, wondering around your VCM schedule with the Commission in Georgia, are you seeing any uptick in terms of the activity or aggressiveness in terms of interveners in that case? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Dan, I bet you can read that both ways, right? Certainly, we have to be aware of and responsive to any of the issues that come to Public in South Carolina. I certainly can't comment on any of those for them, but I certainly can for us. The good news is that we've had this processed. It's VCM processed. It's proven to be such a blessing and the way we have worked with Dr. Jacobs has been so terrific. As well, every VCM process we've invited. It's been a welcoming kind of exercise to have any and all the interveners participate in what is now VCM 17 for heaven's sake. So this has been all a good process, and so I don't think we've had these kind of surprises at the Georgia Public Service Commission. So in general, I think we've been thoughtful in the process. The Commission has run a terrific kind of regime in evaluating Vogtle now over the years, and I think we have a thoughtful way to proceed and I think the other thing, just to be clear, when you look at the broad public support we have, whether it's statements by the Commission or the Governor or the legislature or the public polling that we do, our position is widely supported here in the state of Georgia. And I will say, we've had tremendous support out of the federal government. You should know that I think at the federal government level, our continued participation in Vogtle really does have significant national security concerns, and I think that's why you've seen such terrific support, and loan guarantees and support for getting the production tax credit through. We'll see how that ends up, but a host of other issues, the NRC, I should be very mindful to thank them and streamlining the ITAC process. We've eliminated a lot of the tests, or consolidated the tests, I should say. And we just continue to get great kind of support going forward. We still have to execute. There's still risk on the table. We completely get that, but boy, oh boy, I think this is a good external environment in which to move forward. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. In response I think it that was to Michael, when you talked about, I know the productivity \u2013 you mentioned, I think, that 95% of the components are on the side, I was curious what are you still waiting to receive, commodities mostly? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Dan, most of those are commodities, wire, just equipment necessary to complete the construction of the assets. So, most of the major components are on the ground. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : So none of the things are being... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Not that I'm aware of. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : ...whatever. Okay. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, your turbines are there. Panels are there, all the big stuff. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : All the shield panels and whatever? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Steam generators, all that big stuff is there. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then just to verify, I think you mentioned a little bit, the nuclear island and turbine building. I was wondering if you'd give a little more detail on what kind of the fourth quarter or before your next earnings call, what are the critical path items that are kind of scheduled for this next three months or so? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Dan, we've got a slide in the appendix, I believe. It's slide 13, that we'll outline a lot of that stuff for you, both the near term progress items and then horizon projects. And it outlines them for both Unit 3 and Unit 4. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And I think as Art said earlier, when you look at these kinds of things, when you see words like containment building, that is kind of pointing to critical path items. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Correct. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. That's all I have. Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Dan. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, sir. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I just want to thank everybody. It's an exciting time, and thank you for your patience. I know we got a lot of positive activities going on right now and I know some of those positive activities are not going to be dimensionable until they're executed. We expect to see a lot more information on that in the next quarter and certainly, by our next earnings call, we'll have a much more thorough explanation as to the gives and takes and what that means to our growth rate going forward. We feel very confident in our path. We're excited about the future and we appreciate your attention and participation as an investor. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company third quarter 2017 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. As we report our 2017 results and look ahead to 2018 and beyond, our focus remains on investing in premier, state-regulated utilities and providing outstanding risk-adjusted returns for investors. Whether it's great customer satisfaction, high reliability, strong economies, constructive regulatory frameworks or credit quality, our portfolio of electric and gas utilities is a tremendous driver of value. Additionally, Southern Power's large national portfolio of long-term contracted renewable and natural gas assets and Power Secure, a small, but growing portfolio of distributed energy resources, continue to be great complements to our customer-focused business model. In 2017, we continue to provide the best customer service in the business. In fact, Southern Company and its four state regulated electric utilities continued to achieve the top five rankings on the Customer Value Benchmark Survey, while Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas were named among the most trusted brands in their industry. Customers are at the center of everything we do and our utility franchises operate in some of the most constructive jurisdictions in the country as evidenced by rate outcomes at several of our electric and gas utilities. 2017 represented one of our strongest operational performance years in recent history. Our transmission team had its best year ever and our generation fleet performed exceptionally well. We also continued our track record of outstanding storm response during an active 2017 hurricane season. Let's turn now to Plant Vogtle 3 and 4. Over the course of 2017, Georgia Power and the plant's other co-owners successfully navigated the bankruptcy filing by the project's primary contractor, Westinghouse. Southern Nuclear, the licensee and eventual operator of the plant, successfully assumed control of the site and the Vogtle owners brought nuclear-experienced Bechtel, on site as the prime contractor. The project owners also negotiated a new services contract with Westinghouse, which includes the necessary intellectual property rights to complete and run the project. Georgia Power filed its recommendation to complete the plant in August of 2017. Since then, there have been significant risk mitigating milestones. First, in September, Georgia Power received a $1.7 billion Conditional Commitment for incremental DOE loan guarantees, which now total $5.13 billion and are expected to save Georgia Power customers over $500 million in interest costs. Between October and December, the Vogtle owners received 100% of the $3.7 billion Toshiba guarantee obligation, of which, Georgia Power's share is $1.7 billion. In late December, the Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved and deemed reasonable the revised project cost and schedule estimates, which included an additional $1.6 billion in costs as well as November 2021 and November 2022 in-service dates for Units 3 and 4, respectively. As part of the approval, the Commission further adjusted ROEs during construction and allowed for decoupling of the rate base treatment of Unit 3 and Unit 4. Recall in 2016, the Commission deemed or presumed prudent $5.68 billion in project costs. And more recently, following extensive bipartisan efforts in the House and in the Senate, the United States Congress eliminated the deadline for receiving advanced nuclear production tax credit, providing approximately $1 billion in future benefits for Georgia Power customers. We are grateful to the current administration and Congress for recognizing the importance of new nuclear generation and demonstrating renewed federal support for Vogtle 3 and 4. And at the state level, the Georgia Public Service Commission continued its vision and support by moving this project forward. Now for an update on construction at Vogtle 3 and 4. Since Southern Nuclear has taken control of the site, we have sustained improvements in productivity and critical path execution. As you can see in the materials provided this morning, the team at the site is working towards a construction schedule that is approximately eight months in advance of the November 2021 and November 2022 in-service dates that were approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Productivity is on track, with milestones continuing to be met, including the placement of the 225,000-pound Unit 3 pressurizer in January and the placement of 1,300 cubic yards of concrete inside the Unit 4 containment vessel in December. Of course, there is a long way to go, but these early results are encouraging. And finally, federal tax reform has been a hot topic for many and it is no different for Southern Company. The net effect of the new law is that it is tremendously beneficial to customers and our economy. The lower corporate tax rate and the preservation of interest deductibility for utilities are expected to lower customer bills over the long term and help drive continued economic growth throughout our service territories. However, in conjunction with those benefits, the new law also reduces cash flow to our companies. We are keenly focused on preserving our credit profile. Strong credit ratings accrue to the benefit of all of our stakeholders and preserving those ratings is the focus of ongoing dialogues with our state regulators. As Art will cover later, we will work to support our ratings in a customer- and investor-friendly manner. I'll turn the call over, now, to Art for a financial review. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, the adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2017 exceeded our estimates, and for the full year of 2017, we earned at the top end of our guidance range on an adjusted basis. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we had reported earnings of $496 million or $0.49 per share, compared with $197 million or $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2017, reported earnings were $842 million or $0.84 per share compared with $2.45 billion or $2.57 per share in 2016. On an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter, Southern Company earned $509 million or $0.51 per share compared with earnings of $295 million or $0.30 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2017, on an adjusted basis, which excludes the charges associated with the Kemper Project, along with the related AFUDC equity resulting from extending the schedule prior to the suspension of construction, charges associated with Plant Scherer Unit 3 as a part of Gulf Power's rate case settlement, wholesale gas services, acquisition and integration costs and the net impacts of federal tax reform legislation, Southern Company earned $3.02 billion or $3.02 per share, compared with earnings of $2.76 billion or $2.90 a share in 2016. A reconciliation of our as-reported and as-adjusted results is included in the materials we released this morning. The major earnings drivers for the full year of 2017 when compared to our $2.90 per share adjusted results for 2016 were the inclusion of a full year of Southern Company Gas, including our 50% interest in the Southern Natural Gas pipeline, retail revenue effects at our state-regulated electric utilities and an aggressive management of O&M at our state-regulated utilities, offset by mild weather, increased interest expense and increased shares. Before we cover the details of our 2018 guidance and long-term outlook, I'd like to cover the impact of tax reform on our financial outlook. As Tom mentioned earlier, tax reform clearly provides an enormous benefit to customers and the economy. This opportunity, however, comes with a cost in the form of lower operating cash flows at our state-regulated utilities and, absent mitigation, lower FFO to debt ratios. As we engage with each of our state regulatory jurisdictions regarding the impacts of tax reform, our objective is to provide meaningful rate benefits to customers while preserving our credit quality, which clearly benefits customers over the long run. Working constructively with our regulators, we are seeking to implement a variety of balanced solutions, which achieve both of those key objectives. For example, in some cases, we'll seek to preserve cash flow by amortizing existing regulatory assets as an offset to tax-related regulatory liabilities. Also, where possible, we'll look to reduce debt at the utility level, which comes in the form of a higher mix of equity in our regulated capital structures. And finally, to ensure adequate credit metrics, we expect some level of de-leveraging at the parent company as well. Successful execution of this strategy will result in a financial outlook with less leverage and stronger credit quality, which support the value proposition from our state-regulated utilities. Now, turning to our 2018 EPS guidance, as you can see in the materials provided this morning, our 2018 EPS guidance range is $2.80 per share to $2.95 per share, with the midpoint of $2.87. A key driver for the starting point of this range is the receipt by Georgia Power of 100% of its $1.7 billion portion of the Toshiba parent guarantee. Our success in this effort represents an important benefit to shareholders through a significant risk reduction for the Vogtle 3 and 4 project and results in lower cost for Georgia Power customers during construction. A high-level reconciliation of our 2018 EPS guidance range is available in the materials for this call. As for the earnings estimate, for the first quarter of 2018, we estimate that we'll earn $0.84 per share. Looking towards our long-term outlook, starting with the 2018 midpoint of $2.87 per share, our long-term earnings per share growth outlook is 4% to 6%. It's important to note that the year-over-year earnings contribution from Vogtle 3 \u2013 Units 3 and 4 over the next several years is not linear due to the various construction period ROEs recently approved in VCM-17. The earnings from Vogtle 3 and 4 represent less than 6% of our expected earnings over the next five years. Removing the Vogtle 3 and 4 contribution from the mix results in an underlying Southern Company earnings profile, supported by strong growth across our state-regulated electric and gas utilities, that is still expected to grow at 4% to 6%. Compared to our 2016 Analyst Day, our long-term outlook is being driven by stronger state-regulated earnings profile that is backed by higher invested capital growth in our state-regulated electric utilities and a continued strong performance from our gas LDCs. Invested capital in our state-regulated utilities is projected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6%. This is driven by a $22 billion five-year investment plan for our electric utilities, which excludes Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and supports a 4% electric-invested capital growth. Additionally, the state-regulated LDCs within Southern Company Gas are projected to invest $6 billion over the next five years with an invested capital growth rate of approximately 9%. As we discussed on our last earnings call, our future equity needs have continued to evolve over the past year. Over the next five years, we forecast an average annual equity need of approximately $1.4 billion. Approximately 80% of this equity is expected to be invested directly into our state-regulated electric and gas utilities to support increased credit-supported equity ratios and to fund increased capital investments such as Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and our business modernization initiatives. These are terrific opportunities to improve our overall value proposition by enhancing our risk-return profile of our regulated franchises. We have robust equity plans, which can provide upwards of $1.5 billion per year of new equity and we have demonstrated an ability to source equity in an investor-friendly manner. For example, we announced in 2017 the sale of Elizabethtown Gas, our planned sale of 33% of Southern Power's solar portfolio and the use of third-party tax equity on new Southern Power projects. As we look to fund our current equity need forecast, we plan to be equally thoughtful and investor-focused. Our 4% to 6% growth rate assumes continued constructive regulatory treatment across our utilities, including tax reform mitigation plans and consolidated FFO to debt of 16% to 16.5%, excluding the impact of Vogtle 3 and 4 during construction. Financial integrity and strong credit ratings provide significant benefits to customers and have always been a priority for us. That emphasis remains unchanged. The top end of our earnings per share growth rate assumes incremental investment opportunities in our state-regulated utilities, combined with aggressive management of O&M inflation, optimized equity funding and better-than-expected growth from our unregulated businesses, including Southern Power. Now let me touch briefly on our dividend. Southern Company has an outstanding 70-year track record of dividends and dividend growth. Over this period, we've paid 280 consecutive quarterly dividends that have been the same or higher than the previous quarter. We are proud of this track record and continue to make thoughtful, sustainable dividend growth recommendations to our board. We fully believe the financial outlook we have presented, with its improved state-regulated profile, continues to support our objectives of growing the dividend at $0.08 per year. I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Art. As we look forward, we believe Southern Company is solidly positioned to deliver on its value proposition as our customer and community-focused business model continues to serve us well across our portfolio of companies. We have a transparent, well-balanced path forward to 4% to 6% EPS growth, which should also support our dividend objective. As we optimize the risk-return equation of our business, our strategies to preserve credit quality post-tax reform are intended to provide a solid foundation for value creation for both customers and investors alike. Thanks, once again, for joining us this afternoon. We'll now move to question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello Shar. Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Hey guy. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: How are you? Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Good. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Great. Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : So just two quick ones. First, on the $1.4 billion in equity per year that was disclosed today. How much should we think about being allocated to sort of increasing the equity layers at the various utilities? Or another way to ask is, do you sort of have an allocation in mind between the various states for modeling purposes? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, about half. Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Okay, about half? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on, lastly on the tax reform assumptions that's in your base assumption, what you're assuming as far as the plan to credit back to rate payers and is there any potential to spread out further in time redeploying to sort of near-term capital opportunities in order to get you that incremental investment opportunities to get you to the top end sort of, how are you thinking about this? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. You know what's interesting about the incremental capital opportunities is we looked at the profile of our CapEx over time, I think you've probably heard this before, but we tend to be conservative in our projections. And one of the things that we have seen is that we budget really well for this year and pretty well for the next year and the year after, but starting in years four and five, because they can't see some of the CapEx opportunities, we tend to budget less and less. And so, it's very common for us to have kind of a downward-sloping CapEx projection. When we looked in history, in fact, we tend to fill those things in. So in effect, what we have thought about is essentially levelizing as a concept a CapEx appetite at the state companies. And that kind of incremental opportunity gets you more to the top of the range. Of course, we will manage O&M so that there are no price increases to customers as a result of that activity. And I think we got good capacity to do that. Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Well, thanks so much guys. That's very helpful. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Just curious on the dividend and sticking with that $0.08 when you have such a, kind of, significant incremental equity need. How did you sort of weigh that up here? Is it you're targeting a percentage growth because I know you've been at this $0.08 level for a while now? How should we think about where you want to be on payout eventually? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. So one of the things we're looking at, dividend policy is one of the ultimate signaling theories in finance, right? And when we look at our profile kind of over the next five years, it's clear that while our payout ratio may be in the 80% range for a period of time, once Vogtle clears to in-service, there is a sharp drop in our payout ratio. When we look at the viability of our ability to deliver on the growth objectives that we've outlined here, we think it's very advisable to stay the course on the dividends, regular, predictable, sustainable and live with, for a period of time, kind of an 80% payout ratio. Maybe a little north of that from year-to-year, because we believe once we emerge from the construction of Vogtle, we'll be back down in the 70s in a pretty healthy way. It's better to stay the course than it is to try and vary over a temporary period. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that, Tom. And then just on slide 25, where you look at the growth with and without Vogtle. Just \u2013 it's certainly clear that the red 4% to 6% is starting off that midpoint of 2018, so... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And your \u2013 effectively the gray lines are showing us where you would fall within that given the earnings at Vogtle in any particular year. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. You got it right, Jonathan. The starting point is 2018 and the gray lines do represent the nonlinear benefit of Vogtle over that next four-year timeframe or five-year, yeah, four years beyond 2018. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: And I think it was important for us to point out kind of that fact, Jonathan. When you look at what Vogtle represents to our total earnings picture, it is only 6% of our projected EPS during this next four to five years. 94% of our earnings are going to still deliver 4% to 6%. So we would want to have that reflected in things like our P/E ratio and stock price performance. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Please just correct me, you're pretty much saying that the top end of the gray dotted lines that you would expect to still be within the 4% to 6% off of the 2018 guidance in all of those years. And so, I'm curious, so what's the purpose of the \u2013 without Vogtle? Because it seems a scenario where you just don't have the Vogtle earnings, but sort of everything else is fine, just seems to be odd for me to imagine. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I think we're just trying to point out the strength of the underlying business, excluding the earnings associated with Vogtle over the next few years. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. 90 \u2013 let me say it another way. 94% of our earnings are coming ex-Vogtle, and those are exceedingly strong and predictable over time. So all we're laying in is the notion that only 6% is associated with Vogtle during this construction period. Of course, once it goes in-service, it goes back to the earnings rate at Georgia Power. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can I maybe just \u2013 go ahead. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You sounded like you have something to add, Tom. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. Go ahead. It's all right. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I was just going to \u2013 do you have any update on the latest with the Chinese AP1000 and when that might start up and I'll leave it there? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. Yeah. Sure. Westinghouse continues to say they're ready to load fuel what we believe the delay in Sanmen and Haiyang as additional regulatory review of the reactor coolant pump and the squid valves. Now we believe, Westinghouse believes, there's no issue there. This appears to be a technical regulatory oversight delay. But we believe, we don't know of any problem and once the regulator in China agrees to go forward, they'll load fuel. We see no impediments. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: From what you just described, if there was an issue with that sort of feature, is that something that could be changed at the stage you're at or is that something that would be so endemic to the design that it would be hard to change? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, recall some years ago, there were some issues about the reactor coolant pump and there were changes made to the RCP. So that was done way back when I think everything conforms with our understanding of the engineering and ultimate operational performance. We think there's no issue. It's hard to speculate if there were a change required, what that would mean to constant schedule, I just wouldn't want to go there. But the clear understanding we have from Westinghouse, you know that we've had people on site for years now, is that there is no problem. This is a regulatory matter that the Chinese are dealing with. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So you still have people at that site kind of reporting back to you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. We do. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We sure do. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, you bet. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, fellas. So when I'm looking at the guidance on FFO to debt, presumably the difference between 15% to 15.5% including Vogtle and the 16% to 16.5% excluding Vogtle is just, really relates to the earnings stream that you talk about on slide 24 where the clip above the $4.4 billion won't flip into cash flow until the plant's complete? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's it. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : I just want to make sure. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And we've run it by the \u2013 yeah and Greg, we've run this by the rating agencies and they think that this approach is sensible. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. So assuming the plant comes in when it's supposed to come in, goes into rates, that closes the gap between those two numbers? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, it does. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Great. In terms of the regulatory approaches you're making with the different states, and I guess I'm looking for a slide here; it is slide 13. You're taking the equity that you're raising and you're putting it into the following uses : higher regulated equity ratios, reduce parent debt, Vogtle CapEx, essentially. Can you take us \u2013 without burning up a ton of time, just take us through where you've already got sort of a plan in place; like in Florida, for instance, I think you've already got a deal on how you're going to use tax. What should we look for in terms of milestones and timing for understanding the outcomes on tax in Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Greg. This is Art. You're right. Gulf Power has filed a plan or a stipulated agreement with a couple of important interveners. I think the Office of Public Counsel and the Industrial Group there have signed on to the deal where there is an immediate, I believe, refund to customers of a lot of the unprotected deferred taxes, and it also provides for an increase in the equity ratios from 52.5% to 53.5%. And there are also some additional rate reductions that go into place for both their environmental rates and their base rates as well. So it's a comprehensive settlement, but it is a great example of what we're looking for in each of our jurisdictions. That will be different for every jurisdiction we talk about. Georgia, you mentioned, asked for some kind of input or filing last week and that has been postponed for another couple weeks. So there's still discussions going on there, but nothing to point to. Mississippi has filed an amended PEP filing there as well, and they have basically requested an increase in the equity ratio and provided for some mitigation of the rate increase that was initially filed there. That was about a 4% increase; that has now dropped to 2.5%. So that's another good example of what we are asking the regulator to do. It varies by jurisdictions. In the Gas business, we have a number of ongoing rate requests that will include the impacts of tax reform. I believe in Illinois, they're going to adjust tax reform based on the January order that they got out of the rate request they filed last year. So it just varies by jurisdictions. Some we may see this year, some we may see next year; so just stay tuned. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : I'm sorry, did you mention Alabama, how you might go about this conversation in Alabama? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: There's nothing that \u2013 there have been discussions ongoing, but nothing concrete to share at this point. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hey, how are you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Terrific. Hope you're well. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Sort of a housekeeping question, I guess. When we do the numbers, it sort of looks like Southern Power came in a lot stronger than what you had initially been guiding to. I think you were looking sort of in the $0.30 \u2013 in the $0.40 range for them and for SONAT and it looks like it came in sort of north of $1, and it looks like the regulated pieces came in a little bit weaker. Are we reading that right, or are we missing some adjustments? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Are you talking for the quarter, Paul? Are you talking for the year? Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : For the year. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Well, there are a lot of moving parts with Southern Power. They had a lot of new contracts; seven new solar and four new wind contracts where you got most of a full year's worth of benefit there, year-over-year. You had a lot of increase in depreciation there, but I guess one aspect that was not expected last year, and I'm assuming we're talking on an ex-item basis here, that was some state solar investment tax credits that we discovered we qualified for; that accounted for roughly a $0.04 pickup at Southern Power. So that, in my mind, is the only thing that was really boosting their numbers up this year. But year-over-year, I think the numbers were fairly close in terms of net income. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Okay. So maybe we just need to take it offline to see if we're missing some other adjustments. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Paul, on Page 11 of the release, those are not ex items. Those are as-reported items so... Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : We try to just apply the adjustments that were broken out at the bottom of the page, but... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Okay. We can get back to you and get it right. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : And then, I guess, with respect to infusing equity into the regulated operations, would that happen after you get some form of decision out of the regulators or should we start infusing equity even in advance of getting a regulatory response? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. We will only invest equity when we have the authority to do so and earn on it appropriately. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Okay. And then, is there sort of a north limit on what you would ask for in terms of an equity ratio? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You mean a ceiling? Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: What we're solving for is to... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: FFO to debt, yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: ...get back to a FFO to debt percent. That's kind of the way we're doing it. And the beauty of this tax reform is, if you solve to an equity ratio, if that's the only thing you're doing. I said this on TV this morning, just broad numbers, I think we can preserve our financial integrity and still deliver in the range of 5% to 7% rate reductions, but that's if that's all you do. There could be a host of other things that could impact the regulatory treatment. But this is a win-win. There's plenty of room for us to preserve our financial integrity and deliver rate reductions. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Great. That's it from me. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good afternoon. Hey, howdy. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Howdy. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So on Southern Power, let me just pick up where you left off. Curious on what kind of growth you're seeing out of that business. I know you've talked about tax equity, et cetera, but through the forecast period, how much is that contributing given the updated forecast? And then maybe just a second on the back of that would be, what's the future of the company given what seems to be a little bit more of a modest growth profile or that subsidiary rather? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So I'm going to let Art fill in the blanks here. I'll give you the top line and that is certainly, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market. For 2018, we expect to earn somewhere in the $325 million range, but you're right. When you look at our overall plan, we are generally deemphasizing the contribution of Southern Power to our growth rate. You must remember though, one of the things that we put in place in the past is a joint development agreement, largely for wind with Res. So we're still pursuing all of that discretionary growth and we'll see how that turns out. With respect to the equity required for those growth opportunities, I think the kind of incremental equity will be minimal as they'll likely be funded with things like third-party tax equity and internally sourced funds. When you think about that, you should think about that contribution at Southern Power as one of the variables that could drive us upwards in the 4% to 6% range. Art, would you have anything to add there? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Julien, you are asking about where we're going to go and if you look at our 2018 expectations out of Southern Power, there's \u2013 not a lot of that growth is expected to be \u2013 or not a lot of that income is expected to be driven by new projects. Most of our joint development agreements, the opportunities there would probably begin delivering income in 2019. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: As we look year-over-year though, we'll certainly keep about the same level of production tax credits. We just put into \u2013 I guess we just signed an agreement on a new, small solar deal. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Solar deal, 20 megawatts. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. And then we got our ongoing energy margins and our amortizations of ITC, which are, I think, year-over-year will be pretty close to the same, but we've also \u2013 are probably going to book in the first quarter some restructuring gains that will primarily be benefiting our \u2013 or optimizing our state apportionment rates across all the states that we have. And that will be a pickup of $0.04 or $0.05 of earnings at Southern Power. So when you look at year-over-year, we're going to be pretty close to the same level of net income as we were in 2017. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And I think the real point... Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : What about the state of the overall business if it isn't contributing meaningful amounts of growth? I mean obviously, that's a variable to be solved for, but how do you think about it in that context? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, we think that the state-regulated businesses, especially the way we've recast it, represents a lion's share of our growth opportunity. And in fact, when you think about kind of the equity needs, however we solve them, whether it's shares over programs or through investor friendlier kind of means, it represents I think 80% of the shares are going to be tied up in the state-regulated businesses. That provides the lion's share of growth going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. In fact, actually, if you were to break it down, how much of the 4%, even at the bottom end, is driven by the state programs versus, call it, energy infrastructure versus gas? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. That one is hard to break down. We've got so many moving parts in here, so. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: What's interesting, we need to get back to you on that. But I'll tell you this, we have thought about this one. The net income profile of Southern Power isn't going to grow a whole lot over the future, but the earnings per share profile, we'll still deliver. In other words, because we're using tax-advantaged equity, while R will grow modestly, E won't grow hardly at all, and so we'll still deliver pretty good EPS, but the thrust is right and we'll get you the right percent and everything else between the two. The real lion's share of our EPS growth right now is in the state-regulated businesses. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. All right. Thank you, all. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Tom, how are you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Terrific. Hope you're well. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I am. Thank you. Quick question. You had some monetizations to raise equity. What would be a reasonable share count to use for 2018? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Hold on a second. Let's see, Paul. Our guidance range really assumes a range of possible outcomes. We said we have a $1.4 billion need. We certainly got a lot of tools at our disposal. The timing of that will be spread over the year. But as we've also said, we've got opportunities to do it in a shareholder-friendly way, which might mitigate that as well. So it's a hard question to answer and the range that we've given you is really the outcome of a number of different assumptions around all of the moving parts. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So I guess, one way to say it, Art, is kind of, at its most conservative, we can fully support this 4% to 6% growth rate and our credit metrics by using our internal plans and any at-the-market kind of effort. To the extent we do \"investor-friendly means\", means other than those shares, we could certainly improve within the range. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So, I mean Art's right. It's hard to say. It depends on the success and the opportunity we see elsewhere in the market on some of these other ideas. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, on your slide deck, slide 16, you've got parent contributing a negative $0.47, what was that in 2017? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We'll have somebody looking for it and somebody will look for it. I just don't have it at my fingertips. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, just back to a previous question, you said look for net income at Southern Power to be essentially flat in 2018 versus 2017? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. $3.25 million (45:57) would be my best guess; of course, it varies all over the place. Would be my guess. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is Southern Power not going to see a pickup from tax reform? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yes, they will be a beneficiary of that to the tune of $15 million to $20 million; but recall, also, that we are in the process of monetizing the 33% of the solar portfolio, which would coincidently kind of offset the benefit and the tax gain. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So the loss of that income. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: In 2018, so that's right. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: The benefit of tax reform equals the loss of income from the sale of solar. So the net effect is you keep income constant and you raise cash and offset shares. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it, got it. I'm good and if you could just find that number, you can just inject later on. Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Hold on, $0.31, okay. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: What's the big driver there? I know that obviously the tax shield is a piece of that. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's the biggest thing... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: The debt has increased. So it's a full year effect of lot of the parent debt, right? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay, thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon. How are you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Paul. Great. How are you? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : All right. On slide 6, I'm sorry if I missed this, but the gas supply write-off of $0.10 for 2018. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Right. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : What's causing that? I mean, could you just elaborate a little bit more on that? Is that sort of one-time in nature? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That was the amount of shares associated with replacing the hull, the credit quality hull from the write-off of the gasifier last year in 2017, at the ongoing carry and also the income loss associated with that. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I got you. So is the income loss associated with no longer having the gasifier... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Right. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : ...regulatory speaking and the impact of issuing equity... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Not having an earning asset there. And I'm proud to say, these guys do more of the shows than I do, but even the shows I was at, I can remember drawing people a line that showed the 5% growth, which is the $0.15 and then the write-off and then $1.7 billion from Toshiba, this is stuff that we've had out there for some time. And this tax reform, this negative $0.06, we're going to work really hard to mitigate that. So I think we're going to be exactly kind of where we thought we might be, based on the talk we gave kind of at the balance of 2019, I mean, 2017. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, when we look at the slide nine, you mentioned that there's this business modernization that you're going to be doing some spending on, but O&M is supposed to be reducing or offsetting the revenue impact associated with that number. What I was wondering is, given the other sort of substantial CapEx that you guys are projecting at the regulated utilities, what we should think about the ongoing rate impact of that? Sort of, how do we think about the amount of capital that you're spending, that you're putting into these businesses and your ability to do the business modernization stuff that you outlined on slide nine, with the other non-business mod, non-Vogtle CapEx, if you follow me? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, you bet. If you want to look at a company that's done just a terrific job at this, I would go right to Georgia Power. They did a variety of things where they invested in technology and really took money out of the business, not only O&M, but some other investments like a lot of the local towns. But in that process, we've actually increased the reach to those customers, I want to say by a factor of 4. So it's interesting. Our customer base is getting used to more and more the use of technology in terms of managing our relationship with them. We still have important personal touch in the communities that we're privileged to serve, but I think Georgia Power has been a great example of taking O&M down and improving their CapEx potential. One other really important \u2013 and let me say this just another way, if I reverse that. The technology investments, that is the modernization efforts, in many ways, permit the ability to take O&M out. And if you think about Georgia Power during this time, they were named The Most Trusted Electric Utility in America. So we were all worried about what does this all mean to our relationship with customers and it remains really strong. One other concept. You guys know that I help lead for all the electric industry in America, whether it's IOUs, co-ops and munis, but the whole notion of providing appropriate levels of national security for this most critical part of our infrastructure is something that I'm very focused on. And I think this new word that starts to creep into, whether it's an infrastructure bill in Congress or in our dialogues around modernization goes not to reliability or potentially even service, but to the notion of resilience. That's going to become increasingly important as we think about protecting this most valuable asset. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. But I guess what I'm wondering is, how should we think about the rates that \u2013 the rate increases that are associated with your CapEx and EPS growth? Do you follow what I'm saying? Just generally speaking, I'm not asking for huge granularity here. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : But just generally speaking, how much do you think we can offset, right? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Something below inflation. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. That's what I would \u2013 and even our profile on nonfuel O&M will be to eliminate the inflation in the numbers and, again, to drive it below zero, if we can, to help fund these opportunities for mod capital. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And frankly, I think we have the capacity to do that. But if you wanted a number to use, it would be below an inflation rate. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, just finally on the sales growth, I noticed in the sort of appendix of the slides that you said flat to extremely modest, I think. Maybe I'm missing the term, but it sounded \u2013 I'm just wondering, just reiterate the sales growth that you guys are looking at in your service territory. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: They are flat. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, if you get specific by class, it's probably a bit of growth in the industrial class and a bit slightly negative on the residential and commercial. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You know, the Southeast still is good, though. You think about it, we've had better than U.S. experience on population growth for both our gas and electric properties. And job growth is much better than the national average in terms of our electric properties. So you know what? I mean, what we're seeing in terms of flat is really a function, I think, of technology on behalf of customers. One other effect that we think may occur during this year is, as other companies \u2013 this is actually good for the economy, but as other companies now can expense their CapEx, we may see a lot more facility improvements, store restructurings, manufacturing, and that may have the effect of increasing the rate of investment of energy efficiency. That's why we believe, this year, it's flat. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Hey, Tom. Hey, Art. Thank you for taking my question. I have two focus areas. First, when I look at slide 26, which has your CapEx by subsidiary on the regulated and at Southern Power, and if I compare it to the same slide in last year's guidance, so the fourth quarter 2016 five-year outlook, two things stand out. One is that the five-year capital plan for Alabama Power is up materially, $1.5 billion. And the other is that the five-year gas LDC spend is actually down from $6.7 billion to $6.1 billion, so $500 million or $600 million. Can you just talk about what the \u2013 what's happening on the capital side and what that money is being spent on in those two jurisdictions \u2013 or those two businesses? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, the gas one's easy. It's the sale of Elizabethtown is assumed. So you've lost Elizabethtown's CapEx; that's what that is. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: And Alabama's increase is reflective of modernization capital; that was not in last year's numbers. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it, okay. So lots of the incremental T&D in Alabama and when you file for rate recovery under annual rate recovery methodologies, you'll benefit and customers will benefit by having the rate reduction that's caused by tax reform and that gets partially offset by the incremental capital? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. The other thing is... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, and of course... Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Go ahead. I'm sorry. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, go ahead. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: My other question is it sounded like you're going to do the $1.4 billion or so of equity every year over the five years, but I'm just curious, when I look at the slide 26, CapEx comes down meaningfully after you're really $2 billion, meaning after 2019, meaning it's down almost $2 billion in 2020 over 2018, and almost $3 billion by 2022. Are you really \u2013 shouldn't you be in a position, if that's really what your capital budget is in the out years, that you're basically generating a lot of cash? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Well, there's a couple effects in there. Recall, we talked about a variety of means to raise the equity, and what you're referring to is essentially a plan that still achieves 4% to 6% growth, but which uses kind of sales of shares through our plants, okay? To the extent we could do, say, more investor-friendly means of raising cash and equity, that certainly would be lumpier and maybe, potentially, more front-end-loaded and may reduce, frankly, the number of shares required. We'll just see. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: And I think, Michael, as you look at Southern Power on that line, it basically reflects only the committed capital and maintenance capital to support existing assets or new projects that we've committed to. It would be incremental needs for beyond that and we've kind of set that out in a separate Southern Power slide. I believe it's in the appendix. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And the other thing that's going to impact timing, for sure, will be how the regulatory process has evolved at each of the companies. As I said earlier on this call, we're not going to invest equity until we have a regulatory construct that supports earning on it. So that also will have an influence as to how we send out the capital. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Art. Much appreciated, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon. Thanks for joining us. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Absolutely. Thank you for taking the question. So my question, actually, was on the regulatory construct you just talked about. Can you be a little bit more specific in terms of some of the variables that are at play? For example, there's the $7.3 billion deferred tax liability. Wanted to understand how is that \u2013 is that protected or unprotected, or how much is protected, unprotected? And what kind of timeframe are you working towards in terms of refund or are you offsetting against regulatory asset? Some color or context around that cash flow profile would be helpful. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Praful. This is Art. Listen, I don't want to go state-by-state, because we're going to be getting ahead of the regulatory process a bit. It will vary by state. Some states have amounts of, say, storm damage cost, that is a reg. asset on their books. That might be something they themselves of to provide a temporary pickup in cash for recovery of that. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And deal with equity ratio later. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: And then deal with equity ratios later. So there are all kinds of pieces. And if you take out all of the assets, right, that's the total of the protected and unprotected deferred tax assets would be, what, $7 billion, $8 billion? And about... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: $7 billion. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: And about $5.7 billion of that is protected and the remainder would be unprotected. And that's at a Southern level. So it's going to vary by operating company and I believe in the K, you can find a breakdown by each of the companies. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And the other thing that would probably be helpful in thinking about this, what we're solving for is this kind of preserving financial integrity. So that means getting back to appropriate FFO to debt levels. Without mitigations, tax reform would translate into approximately 2% to 3% impact at the states and maybe 3% to 4% at the Southern Company level, so that's kind of what we're solving for here. That may be helpful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I got you. That is super-helpful. I appreciate that. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then secondly, just in terms of the Southern Power investment, you talked about $1.5 billion and you've not kind of shown in your plan, but you footnoted that there are scenarios under which you could have an incremental $1.5 billion in the out years in terms of Southern Power investment. Like what would be the variables that would trigger that potential incremental investment? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Greater than expected penetration on the res investments, for example. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: The joint development agreement. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right. The wind deal that we've signed up that joint development for. And there could be a variety of other things. It comes with a transom. I mean, the whole point though is that is purely discretionary and our plan is that largely, we believe that would be funded through internal means or alternative sources of equity like tax equity, project finance or whatever. The clear message here is this 4% to 6% growth is being driven by investments and performance at our state-regulated entities. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Praful. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Stephen, how are you? Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Oh, great. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. I think my questions have been addressed. As I understand it, just on the impact to FFO and tax reform, just given that essentially you're in discussions with a variety of subsidiaries, your overall take is it's not the right time to try to give more detailed guidance in terms of the exact impact to FFO from tax reform just given how many variables are at play, am I understanding that right? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, basically. When it's done, it will be done and we'll tell you everything about it. I think we have outlined though the potential effects of tax reform and we've outlined kind of how we believe we're going about it. So it's some combination of unwinding our regulatory asset or liability or how we expect to restore our credit metrics through equity ratios, for example. So that's kind of the how, the what will show themselves when we reach agreement. But we, historically, we don't like to get in front of the states as they go through these sensitive discussions. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. That's all I had. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello again. Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey everyone, this is \u2013 hey, this is Eugene, actually, on for Shar. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Okay. Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC : I apologize... (1:03:26) Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Well, I think you kind of touched on it already with (1:03:34) saying you don't want to get in front of the state approval process, but I guess to the extent, a follow up to Shar's question about the equity going into the regulated utilities. To the extent you're asking for approval for higher equity ratios, could we also \u2013 could we assume that once that's approved, that you'd be earning on that, the higher equity ratio like a hypothetical capital structure as opposed to waiting for actual equity to be infused into the utilities? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, I think that's a great question and it's all going to revolve around the timing, the timing of the approvals and when the equity is funded or how quickly it's funded and that may occur over time as well, so. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: But I think it will be our intention, you're asking a hypothetical. It would be our intention and it would be simultaneous. In other words, if we got the authority to increase in equity ratio, we would make sure that they had the capital that represented that equity in place. Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. That's fair. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And I think it goes back to somebody's earlier question that said, you're looking at $1.4 billion per year and we said that might be lumpy based on regulatory outcomes. That would be a reason why. Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Understood. Thanks, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, you bet. Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, it's been an exciting time in the industry. I know \u2013 I think everybody has been wrestling with what does tax reform mean and it's quite a process. The net of it is, we think there's plenty of economics there to have a win-win agreement with all of our jurisdictions, that is that we can preserve our financial integrity and reduce rates to customers and we think that's good not only for our customers, for the company, but also for the growing economy. I think it's been a real shot in the arm to us all. The other thing I hope you'd take from this call is that as we've evaluated these opportunities, there's been a real redistribution of growth away from Southern Power. We're still committed to Southern Power. We still think there's opportunity and that provides upside to our forecast, but the real redistribution of growth in our focus really goes now to the regulated utilities that we have in some of the best jurisdictions in America. We think this is a plan that will be very promising and we will execute as well as we can and we'll update you as things develop. Thank you very much for being with us on this call. We appreciate your interest in Southern Company. See you soon. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. My name is Frank and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Wednesday, May 2, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Frank. Welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Each of our major business units had a great start to the year. Our state regulated electric and gas utilities as well as our other businesses are on track to deliver on their targets for 2018. As we've mentioned before, tax reform provides an enormous benefit to our customers and the economy. During the first part of this year, we received constructive regulatory results in several of our states including our two largest subsidiaries. Recall as a part of our tax reform strategy, we have been engaging with each of our state regulatory jurisdictions to provide meaningful rate benefits to customers while preserving the credit quality of each of our state regulated utilities. Thus far, tax reform has produced over $1.7 billion of benefits to our customers, and our regulators have demonstrated their steadfast support of preserving the credit quality of our utilities by accommodating higher equity ratios. As we continue working through our remaining jurisdictions we will keep you informed. Let's now turn to an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. With more than 6,000 workers on site, our focus remains on productivity and safe, efficient high quality construction. As of the end of March, total construction is slightly more than halfway complete. Significant progress continues in all phases of construction, with the setting of modules and equipment for Unit 3, setting up the reactor vessel for Unit 4, both commodity installation and major concrete placements across the project. In fact, several areas in the plant are already being transitioned from the construction team to the operations team. If you can see on the materials provided this morning, the team at the site continues to work toward an accelerated construction schedule ahead of the November 2021 and November 2022 in-service dates that were approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. All critical path milestones are on track and our continued progress over the past several months is encouraging. To be clear, there is a lot of hard work ahead, particularly associated with confined areas like the reactor containment structure. So there's a long way to go, but we are cautiously optimistic that our work plan will remain ahead of the commission-approved schedule. In the coming months, we are focused on securing additional skilled craft labor, particularly electricians and pipefitters in anticipation of the increased productivity requirements in the critical areas of the project. As a final note on Vogtle 3 and 4, we are encouraged with the fuel load recently completed at Sanmen Unit 1 in China. Recall, Southern has had a number of personnel on site there and they look forward to learning more during the start of activity at these units. I will now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thanks Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2018, reporting earnings of $938 million or $0.93 per share, compared with earnings of $658 million or $0.66 per share in the first quarter of last year. Excluding charges associated with the Kemper Project, Wholesale Gas Services and other items described in our earnings materials on an adjusted basis for the first quarter of 2018, Southern Company earned $893 million or $0.88 per share, compared with $652 million or $0.66 per share during the first quarter of 2017. Major earnings year-over-year drivers for the first quarter of 2018 include revenue effects primarily driven by weather at our state-regulated electrics and by infrastructure investments at Southern Company Gas, as well as optimization of Southern Power state tax positions. These positive drivers were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization. Now moving on to an economic review of the first quarter. The economy is performing well as GDP growth is expected to be 2.7% for 2018, which includes a slight lift from tax reform. In our state-regulated service areas, we are seeing this economic growth translate into employment growth on par with national growth of 1.5%. In Georgia, where we serve both gas and electric markets, 1.7% job growth continues to outpace the nation and Atlanta was ranked third in population growth in 2017 across the 12 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the nation. On the industrial side, the ISM Manufacturing Index averaged 59.7% during the first quarter, signaling a continuation of strong industrial expansion across the nation. We are seeing similar trends in our service territories where 9 out of 10 of our industrial segment showed year-over-year gains in electric sales. The ISM Index for April was at 57.3%, which while still expansionary signaled friction in the industrial supply chain that we will be monitoring. Overall, we expect the economy to continue performing well, supporting customer growth and our energy sales projections. But we are keeping a watchful eye on potential policy interventions such as shifts in interest rates or developments related to international trade landscape that could affect economic growth. Before turning the call back to Tom, I want to provide an earnings estimate for the second quarter and share brief updates on our financing plans for this year in Southern Power. First, we estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.65 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Now for an update on our financing plans. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have been constructively working with our regulators to ensure lasting benefits of tax reform for our customers while preserving credit quality. The recent outcomes in several of our state jurisdictions are supportive of our previously discussed tax reform strategy. Continued success in the execution of this strategy should result in a financial outlook with less leverage and strong credit quality, which supports the value proposition from our state-regulated utilities. Our five-year $7 billion equity need has not changed. Recall approximately 80% of this equity is to be invested directly into our state-regulated electric and gas utilities. The timing of fulfilling our equity needs could be influenced by the nature and the timing of regulatory outcomes, and by our consolidated credit metric objectives. As mentioned on our last call, we will seek to optimize the timing and source of equity by seeking opportunities for investor-friendly funding. The sales of Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas and our planned sale of 33% of Southern Power's solar portfolio should be seen as past examples. The sale of Pivotal Home Solutions is a more recent example that is a small part of fulfilling our current need. As an additional example of our thinking, we are also exploring third-party tax equity financing for much of our existing wind portfolio at Southern Power. Post tax reform, the economics of this financing vehicle could be more attractive given the extension of our tax credit carryforward position well into the next decade. Most of these projects were originally financed corporately at Southern Power. This opportunity could offset approximately $1 billion of Southern Company's $7 billion total equity need at Southern Company, with the potential to receive the funds in the second half of this year. Additionally, we are updating our investment forecast for Southern Power. Post tax reform, it is clear that our optimal allocation of capital is reweighted towards our state-regulated utilities. We continue to expect success with incremental renewable projects, many of which will allow us to leverage equipment purchases we've made to safe harbor the value of production tax credits. Our updated outlook for Southern Power reflects potential growth investments of up to $500 million per year, which is approximately one-third of what we outlined on our last call. These potential growth opportunities will require little to no incremental equity from Southern, as they are expected to be funded with a combination of internally generated cash flow, debt and third party tax equity. Southern Power remains an important part of our business and the long-term contracted nature of these assets serves as a great complement to our state-regulated utility business model. The continued investment in renewable generation at Southern Power and our state-regulated electric utilities is also an important part of our broader, long-term low to no carbon objective. Recall that our 4% to 6% EPS growth outlook is not dependent on unregulated growth. As a result, this more modest opportunity set for Southern Power represents upside within our 4% to 6% range. Moreover, our less aggressive growth outlook should result in reduced costs, further supporting Southern Power's value proposition to the overall enterprise. I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Art. Southern Company has started 2018 with strong momentum. All of our businesses are performing at a high level. Our Board of Directors recently approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.40 per share. This is our 17th consecutive annual increase. And for 70 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. The board's decision to increase the dividend speaks to the enduring strength of our business, which is underpinned by a firm foundation of premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities. Moreover, it supports our objective of providing superior risk adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long term. We're also excited about the forthcoming changes to our management team. As announced two weeks ago effective June 1, Art is retiring and Drew Evans, currently Chairman, President and CEO of Southern Company Gas, will become the Chief Financial Officer of Southern Company. On a personal note, I want to thank Art not only for his 42 years of distinguished service to Southern Company, but also for his friendship. His sound fiscal discipline, strategic thinking and consummate professionalism have been invaluable to our company, as he has helped steer us through some incredible moments in our history. He will be sorely missed. At Southern Company, we are committed to cultivating the best leadership in our industry. This announcement underscores the fact that we continue to advance the thought leadership and experience that serves to support our objective to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy with superior customer service. Operator, we'll now take the first question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey, good afternoon. And Art, you're definitely going to be missed and congratulations. It's been a long and illustrious career. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thanks Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So a question on the $7 billion. So I think you were pretty clear, you need $7 billion over five years, average, $1.4 billion. But should I be \u2013 the $365 million you're raising from the Pivotal transaction, should I consider that as one of the sources of that $7 billion or is that outside of that box? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. That's within our financial plan. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So it reduces the $7 billion or it's outside of it? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, it reduces it. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got you. Clear. Okay. And so the extent you can do this tax equity financing on the wind, that could reduce it by another $1 billion. You sell 50%... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : ...of 1.8 gigawatts of solar, that reduces it further, et cetera. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: No. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So as we're thinking about... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Now, Greg... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : ...how you whittle this down to the actual amount of common equity you might or might not need, is that the right way to think through it? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: The solar's already spoken for. (16:40) Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: The solar was already part of the plan last year. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So the solar's outside okay. And then you've got some really rational outcomes from the regulators here on doing what they ought to be doing to make sure the credit quality, your operating companies remain sound. But you have to fund that, right? You have to put that equity in to get the earnings and cash flow that they've deemed to be fair and appropriate, reasonable. So would that lead us to believe that the equity needs are sort of front end loaded because you want to get that equity into those subs so that you can get to the appropriate credit metrics faster? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Greg, we've already advanced to Georgia Power, I think it's $900 million of equity. We've taken that in the form of short-term debt until the time we're at a point where we can replace that with equity. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So would it be fair to assume, if we're modeling this, that you can advance the equity infusions to the subs through borrowing at the parent and then pay that off with either asset sale proceeds or equity over time? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Exactly. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Perfect. I'm sure there's a lot of other questions. So I'll get off. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Bud (18:02). Thanks for joining us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hello. Hey, just to clarify Greg's question. The $1 billion of tax equity proceeds in second half, that offsets the $7 billion of equity expected over the next five years? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah that's part of it. We have lots of flexibility on how to think about the equity raise going forward, flexibility in terms of content and time. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: In terms of timing, current plans can handle about $1.5 billion a year. Has the regulatory outcomes in Georgia, Alabama and a few other places, has the higher equity ratio require more equity upfront, like does it front load some of that into the current year? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Georgia, certainly, as I mentioned on Greg's answer, we've already advanced some equity to Georgia Power in the form of debt at the parent temporarily. Alabama's does not start \u2013 their process does not even start until 2019. So theirs is an achievement of an equity ratio over time. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So in other words, you expect the equity to be kind of evenly spread out throughout that five years and you would lever as necessary at the parent in between. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Basically the Alabama plan provides us a pathway in which to raise equity ratios over time. There's some flexibility around that depending upon a host of variables. So as we have the opportunity to raise the equity ratio, we will do that. And obviously, as we do that, that will have a bearing on the amount and timing in any given period. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And one last question on the tax equity. The $1 billion, that's just to refinance existing portfolio projects, or does that include the potential $500 million this year? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It's just the existing portfolio, that's right. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So in other words, there (20:11) could be additional tax equity for new investment? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's exactly right. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: (20:14) Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. Hi, guys. Just looking back to what you could have had when you set out the plan last quarter, I think you calibrated the FFO to debt metric improvement that you were meaning to go after, so like 2% to 3% at the subs and 3% to 4% at the consolidated level. Can you give us any sort of feel for how you feel you're doing with the mitigation achieved so far and other pieces of the plan against what I think was the target? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, look, we have to execute and time will tell, but we're very confident we're going to be right on the money in doing what we need to do. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So we can't kind of specify just kind of how much improvement we've seen yet or... Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, again, it's going to be to the degree we can earn on the equity in the subsidiaries and the more postponed that is, we may have to take down parent debt sooner in order to achieve the targets that we have established. So we will get there one way or the other. We would rather do it in the least dilutive way possible. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah and I bet people are dying to have us kind of lay out what the investor-friendly equity sources are. We'll certainly update you on the next earnings call. And if there's activity before then, we'll certainly bring it to everybody's attention, but it really kind of deals with our execution on all those sources. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can I just pick up on the investor-friendly comment, Tom? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You, obviously, had a slide that showed this $1.4 billion a year and now you're sort of talking about it more as $7 billion over the five years. I mean do you guys consider investor-friendliness to be getting it behind you, or doing it \u2013 or pushing it out? I mean that's I guess the philosophical question in part. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, it's always better to get it behind you, I think. But the shape, just as we suggested on the last question from Michael, the amount and nature really depends on the execution on these regulatory plans. I must say, we've been very gratified with the response we've gotten out of our states in order to return benefits to customers and balance that with the preservation of financial integrity. We pretty much have execution in Gulf, in Georgia and in Alabama. We have plans in other subsidiaries, so we're working to do that. Our bias in all of this is to preserve our metrics and really restore the financial integrity that we had prior to tax reform. So if we had a bias, I guess it would be to get it done sooner rather than just leave it out there. And always, I think, there's always this notion of overhang in equity issuance. To the extent you eliminate overhang, that's a good thing too. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Tom. And then just on Vogtle, I think in your comments you said that you were kind of cautioning that there's a lot of heavy work in front of you, but that you're cautiously optimistic you would remain ahead of the approved schedule. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You're currently \u2013 quite a decent bit ahead of that schedule. So are you signaling that you think you'll narrow the gap a bit here or do you think you'll stay... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, those of you that have been in my one-on-ones, I do these artful audio-visual presentations. I do this chart to demonstrate, to illustrate what hard work is. A lot of this reactor vessel containment area is tight spaces, a lot of commodity work, a lot of people, and I'm just cautioning everybody. Yeah. The schedule looks fabulous so far. In fact, we are ahead of our April/November \u2013 (24:55) April 2021, 2022, we're ahead of our April schedule so far, but we cannot count on that. I'm just cautioning everybody that with this very tough work, I would expect you to see some erosion in that. But our ability to perform ahead of the regulatory schedule, November 2021 and 2022, I think it's pretty good. I think we feel confident about that. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's great. Thank you. And just on the cost side, can you give us a sense of just your confidence \u2013 you're obviously tracking above at the moment, but... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ...what gives you the confidence you have the line of sight that you can sort of accomplish the schedule and bring the costs to into where they need to be? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. What's interesting about that cost chart is that we had \u2013 make the note, performance remains well within the thresholds of the approved estimate to complete. What we should note is that that cost chart is really tracking the kind of personnel efficiency, labor efficiency that is associated largely with the Bechtel work. That represents about 20% of the remaining cost in front of us. So, yeah, it looks like it's substantially above the cost target. We really want and are working very hard with the Bechtel people at all levels in the organization. And in fact, I probably have been meeting with, via telephone or in person or whatever, Brendan Bechtel. To my level, I know Paul Bowers, the CEO of Georgia Power; Steve Kuczynski, the guys on site. We are working in all levels within Bechtel to try and drive better performance on the cost index. And I think we see our way through to improving it somewhat. But you got to understand, everything we see right now shows that we will be within the cost thresholds that we've had approved at the Georgia Public Service Commission, even if we don't... (27:03) Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: (27:03) the message there, Tom, is don't take that sort of index and apply it to the whole cost, right? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That is exactly right. It's only about 20% of the cost. The rest of the costs are pretty well known. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Stephen. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Hey, Art, congratulations on your upcoming retirement. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Stephen. Appreciate that. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just wanted to go back to what you had walked through in terms of the tax equity and I'm sorry if I missed it. I was just trying to think about just from a GAAP point of view modeling, the cost of the tax equity financing. Could you just refresh my memory on just how to think about the GAAP cost of that financing? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: I'm not sure I know (28:00) Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: What do you mean GAAP cost? Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Oh, the earnings drag from the financing \u2013 from the tax equity financing? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, when we model these kind of things, we certainly do it against our current plan, and to the degree you're giving up the tax equity, which for us is really delayed, and then look at other potential buyers who can use it sooner than we can, we think there's value there. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. It's simply a cost of capital compared to a time value of cash calculation. We wouldn't do it unless it was accretive. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's right. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, understood. I can follow up just to make sure. Sometimes the accounting impacts just trip me up a little bit, I'll follow up off line. And then separately, just on, you've obviously had a number of questions around different approaches to financing. I think you've laid out a number of really creative and shareholder-friendly ways to approach this. Should we be thinking broadly? I know you don't want to get into too much specifics but just conceptually, more around financing options versus certain parts of the business that could be completely monetized. So obviously you have a lot of very valuable franchises and low risk businesses that could be sold. So I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding just conceptually, is it more in the sort of financing realm or is it more in monetization or is really everything a possibility at this point? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, we don't want to talk about specifics, but clearly, I think when you look at our track record in the past, it is a portfolio of a variety of options. We'll consider any and all determined by what gives the best value to shareholders. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Completely understood. And lastly just on Sanmen, it's encouraging to see fuel loading. Do you have a sense for when they're going to go through sort of active testing of the equipment, meaning machinery is actually going to be spinning and they're going to go through real sort of, I guess, not being an engineer sort of operational testing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, we think it's imminent. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I think they're going to do some preliminary warm up. But when they start testing with actual fuel load, I believe that's scheduled for another \u2013 be a month or so. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I mean they'll be \u2013 the word you're looking for is hot. They'll be hot in four to six weeks. There is a lot of machinery that's spinning right now but hot in four to six weeks, if that's the question. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Perfect. That's all I had. Thank you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Angie. Thanks for joining us. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. How are you? And Art, 42 years, wow, it's hard to believe actually, but congratulations. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, so $7 billion reduced by that $1 billion that you mentioned regarding wind, reduced by the proceeds from Pivotal, so the rest would be easily covered by your internal programs. So why do we even need to talk about timing? Is it just simply because the internal issuances of shares would assume some risk of the equity pricing and, hence, you would prefer to potentially front end load some of these issuances? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I mean, it's really a kind of a what and a how. Right? I think the what would be, as we demonstrated in Georgia, to the extent we have the ability to invest equity, reduce leverage at the operating companies and earn on it effectively, certainly that gives rise to an accelerated timing relative to the $1.4 billion per year. And when you think about the knock-on effect, the parent company debt and a variety of other things, I think there are a variety of accretive things we can do that are associated with accelerating equity issuances. The other idea is not so much a what but a how. And that really goes to if we can demonstrate a shareholder-friendly approach to raising equity then, in fact, that takes this kind of overhang issue off the share price and also really speak to the bias of us getting our metrics fixed sooner rather than later. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's where it goes. Don't forget, we've got to address the metric issue and we can't wait forever to do that in order to maintain the ratings that we're seeking to maintain. So there's a lot of balancing around all these issues. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And you believe basically that these potential asset sales, if I understand correctly, would be earnings accretive? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Absolutely. We won't do anything that's not in a balanced way. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, Tom, Art. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Hey. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Tom, just to be clear, as you look at your portfolio and you look for investor-friendly opportunities, is it fair to say that your core electric utility businesses are core to the company not to be messed with, or is everything potentially available as you're looking at equity raising plans? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Ali, it's a very interesting question and, frankly, we've had a lot of debate even internally and even with the board and everything else. I'd, frankly, think almost all of what we have is core. Our business is low risk, infrastructure-driven, state-regulated integrated utilities, that's what it is. Even in \u2013 we've been that way forever in the electric side, when we did the gas side, and remember the underpinning of that strategy was safety-related pipeline replacement programs that provided a very low risk and attractive growth profile. I would argue all of that is core, okay. Pivotal wasn't core. Right? And so that was clear. And there's a few things around the edges that aren't particularly that business. But even so, we would consider the whole portfolio of opportunity if it made sense for shareholders. The ultimate test here is what can we do to benefit you all. And we'll evaluate every opportunity we have whether it's structural or financial. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. And then also just to be clear on the commentary you've had, looking at these avenues but looking at acceleration, et cetera, one, can you remind us \u2013 and I haven't seen this \u2013 but through the first quarter, was there any equity issuance through the plans? And if so, how much have you raised? And secondly, would you take block transactions off the table, or that's still in the menu of getting this behind you? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: To my knowledge, very small amounts of maybe option exercises, but that's it, as far as equity in the first quarter. And as we've said in the past, we've got a toolbox that we can access and block is only one of the issues, we've got a lot of other options, so we're not going to get specific beyond that. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. But nothing is off the table is what you're saying. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: When we have something to say we will certainly say it. We just announced Pivotal. We just announced an idea we've discovered on the PTCs. Certainly, we have our earnings call in July. If we advance something, we'll certainly let you know in due haste. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then separately, looking at more near term from the financial side. So you went into the quarter budgeting or letting us know you were thinking you're going to be earning $0.84 ended up earning $0.88. So what came in better than what you thought, and I know it's early in the year, but could not be extrapolated as you're looking at the full year as well? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Ali, a little bit of that was better sales than what we expected on a weather-normal basis. So I think you've seen our numbers. Retail sales were on a weather-normal basis, up 1.6%. Our industrial sales were up 2.6%. So our forecast was pretty flattish around weather-normal load growth a year. (37:24) So we picked up some there. But the other side of that is O&M, and O&M was really underspent throughout our business enterprises, which really goes again towards our modernization initiative to invest capital and replace it with lower nonfuel O&M. Certainly, there'll be some timing differences that will be part of that, but again, this is the effort upon which we've launched ourself. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: There's another interesting economic trend, the Fed has spoken about this. There was this announcement today, wasn't it, on AllianceBernstein, something like that, but folks moving out of high tax state and local areas into low tax state and local areas. Atlanta, I want to say, was the third fastest growing population of any of the MSAs in the United States. And when you think about kind of this potential megatrend, an unintended consequence of tax reform, we think the Southeast tends to benefit. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, afternoon team and congratulations, Art. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Appreciate it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Absolutely. Thank you rather. So just to come back to the core earnings of the company, as you talked about sort of front end loading at least the Georgia Power piece here, how do you think about where you are with respect to your guidance within the range? And then sort of front end loading even the earnings growth within the period that you talk about, just want to kind of think about the timing of when these bigger factors phase in here. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, we don't really comment on guidance until after the third quarter. Yeah, we've had a good quarter, but again, it was better growth than what we expected, but our weather-normal models aren't perfect either. So we always have preached that. It's more of an art, no pun intended, than science. But our range contemplates all different kinds of scenarios and we'll just see where the rest of the year goes. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I think Art is right. We give the guidance in the year end, so it'd be the February call now, and we update it once a year. We've done that for years and years and years, and we'll do that in October, I guess. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But maybe to clarify here, the 4% to 6% as you guys see it, you would expect despite front end loading, the equity contributions into the utilities but there is still a pretty stable cadence, the 4% to 6%, through your forecast period? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Absolutely. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. That clarifies. Thanks. Let me come back just to the equity raise side of the house here just real quickly. When you say your utilities are \u2013 everything's core, utilities are core, did you have a preference in evaluating, say, Southern Power versus your utilities? And then secondly, let me just also be exceptionally clear about this, because I think I heard you say it. With respect to needing to see something accretive, it needs to be earnings not necessarily credit and earnings accretive? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, we want to be both and we take it as a whole, right? Value is a function of risk and return. If we can buy off risk and at the same time packaged together with a variety of other things still be earnings accretive, that's a home run to us. With respect to Southern Power, recall we built that business with the idea that the long-term bilateral nature of that business as apart from merchant (41:18) with the low to no fuel risk, transmission risk, creditworthy counterparties is a structure that is intended to replicate kind of the risk-return profile of our integrated regulated utility business. So it a part of our core business. We've already contemplated through financial transactions selling off, for example, a third of the solar portfolio. We told you that we would consider selling an economic interest in the production tax credits with the wind, we already have. But that is part of our portfolio of assets and if there is a better combination for shareholders, we'll certainly consider it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Excellent. And just real quickly, Art, if you can clarify this. You expressed a desire to sort of front end load your ability to hit the FFO to debt target you've delineated. Where do you stand again today and what are the agencies saying in terms of the timeline you need to get there with? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, again, I think we outlined in our last call, we're trying \u2013 if you exclude Vogtle, we're trying to get it back to a 16% to a 16.5% FFO to debt ratio. The timelines around that, we've communicated with the agencies about our plans and so they are aware of all the things that we are looking at, but we need to make progress on that at some point in time. I think you asked earlier about front loading the equity in the OpCo, that's certainly true with Georgia, but you'll notice that it's not upfront so much in Alabama. It starts in 2019 and stretches out over a number of years. So I want to make sure and be clear that it's different in every operating company. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hey, thanks. My question's been answered, and Art, best wishes to you and it's been great working with you. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Same here, Paul. Thank you for the comment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, Tom. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks for joining us. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And Tom, thank you for taking my question. A topic that hadn't come up today, how are you looking around the service territories? Really the entire Southeast and thinking about the opportunity to leverage your position in SONAT for incremental midstream or pipeline growth \u2013 organic growth? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Great stuff. I'm going to pull back on comments I made, I'll bet you, two years ago now. There's still is a lot of interest, because the unconventional gas, particularly Marcellus, that area, is different than the traditional gas, the deepwater or coastal Gulf Coast. There has been a number of projects that people are looking at. And I think I spoke about several options that we were presented with from other people. We obviously are a big consumer of gas on our own, even without Southern Company Gas. Southern Company was, I think, the third largest consumer of natural gas in the United States. You throw Southern Company Gas on there, I think we become the most important consumer of natural gas in the United States. And there continue to be interesting ideas of pipes, north to south, as well as pipes west to east. And in fact, our constructive arrangement with Kinder Morgan resulted in the Southern Natural Gas pipeline 50% interest. What we said then was that there may be other opportunities associated with that. And we have executed on, at least one of those, wasn't particularly big. But what we told you also was that as the acquisition of 50% of SONAT gives us optionality, we still think that optionality exists and we'll just be opportunistic in terms of how we exercise it. The opportunities are still out there. We still kick the tires. We still look. We still talk. And we have a guy over at Southern Company Gas, Pete Tumminello who runs a terrific shop, guy with him, Dat Tran, are very, very good gas pipeline people. And so we continue to actively survey the landscape. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks for joining us. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Thanks, guys. Hi. Thanks, and congratulations, Art. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: So, I guess, can't escape the equity question, so I'll come back to that quickly. In terms of the equity, is there a maximum size that you would look to do in a particular year? I get the front loading question, but obviously there is a cap that you would not want to go beyond. Is there any number that we should think of that generally you would not issue beyond that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I'd rather not kind of deal in that realm. What I said before is, that we would be both credit and earnings accretive with any of these ideas. In terms of sizing, I think that is just an area I'd rather not get into at this point. We've already suggested that the shape of our effort here will be highly influenced by, on the regulatory front, the ability to invest equity in an effective way at our regulatory jurisdiction. Let's kind of leave it there for now. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Fair enough. It was worth a shot though. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Praful, that's great. Celebrate good tries. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Yeah. Just following up on the regulatory question then. I guess on the higher equity ratio, is this seen by the regulators as a kind of almost like a bridge to help you get to your stronger metrics, but that you grow back to the lower equity ratios over time? Or is this seen more as a permanent solution going forward? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, it's really just math, if you think about it, tax reform was just a wonderful thing, right? We were able \u2013 and we worked this on our own, we worked it through EEI. But look, we pounded the pavement up in Washington. It was really important for us to maintain interest deductibility, that would have visited (48:30) on our customers an almost immediate rate hike. Then you say, well, we did that. We got lower tax rate which are obviously an advantage, and the quid pro quo must have been that we lost cash flows associated with accelerated depreciation. The commission's I think, we have this very constructive relationship we have for decades down here. Gee whiz, when you think about it, we were able to take the benefits by lower tax rate and use them on one hand to give customer benefits now over $1.7 billion and, at the same time, reduce leverage, increase equity ratios to fix (49:16) back to a coverage ratio. So that has been the plan. Our regulators in the Southeast have always understood that good, healthy utilities are good ultimately for customers. Recall the old circle of life that I started back \u2013 gosh, now it's getting a long time \u2013 15 years ago, when I was CFO, the idea that if we are able to deliver relentless value to customers in terms of reliability and price and service, that generates a tremendous amount of value in the economy. If we generate that value and therefore we earn the ability to have constructive regulation, that gives us an environment in which to invest capital and that gives us an environment in which to grow a good, healthy company. So I think our regulators get that model and I think we all understand that preserving that balance is good for everybody in the long run. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Got you. Super helpful, guys. Thanks. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon. Congratulations, Art. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just quickly on the tax equity market. Has there been any characterization of any change that's happened because of tax reform that you guys have experienced, or is it really pretty much a non-event in the tax equity market for you guys? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I think there was talk during all of the passing of the bill that there was going to be a pinching of the market, that they're going to be penalized, so to speak, but I think all that was fixed. And to my knowledge, Paul, I believe the accessibility, and we got the same players in the marketplace that we'll deal with if we choose to go down that road. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah and I'll just give a little more nuanced answer. There has been a change but it hasn't impacted us. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And why hasn't it impacted you? Could you give us a little more flavor for that? Is it because the type of... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Because I think when you look at scalable high-quality issuers like us, we're always going to cultivate a universe of investors that is quick and easy and sophisticated. We know how to do deals. We've done deals in the past. We have a relationship. We get these things done. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then on the China fuel loading, do we know what actually caused the delay for so long on that? And I just was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that, if you found out what that was and how that may or may not translate to you guys now? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No sir. Pure speculation. There were rumors everywhere, nobody knows. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then finally, you were mentioning something about, I guess, the tax code sort of assisting movement to Georgia, I think. I apologize for not gathering exactly what you were saying. Could you elaborate a little bit on what you were talking about? I'm sorry. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Sure, sure. So there's been \u2013 if you look at the macro trend of population shift in America, for some years, because of economic growth reasons, there has been a shift away from the Northeast and the Midwest, particularly the Rust Belt, into higher growth areas like the Southeast, the desert Southwest, things like that. When you look at the tax code where now you're limited on your ability to deduct state and local taxes, one of the things that now we're starting to see is that people are willing to migrate away from high tax areas, which have high state and local taxes, into low state and local tax areas. And you know what, it was funny, 100 years ago when I was CEO of Gulf Power, I was on Jeb Bush's transition team. And my assignment there were two of his planks, one was education and one was economic development. And one of the theories about at least Florida that we used with Governor Bush at the time was the idea that physical location in this digital age increasingly didn't matter. And so I think you're going to find people that are much more willing to go to places that are nice places to live, that have reasonable human-like commutes, that have affordable housing, that have good education, that have constructive business regulatory and legal environments. Now we have a tax code reason for people to move to those areas. Those are kind of the megatrends I was pointing out. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. But these are still the high net worth individuals really, right? I mean with respect to the tax code changes we're talking about, those don't impact the vast \u2013 you're talking sort of like \u2013 is that what you're talking, you're talking about rich people, I guess, moving to Atlanta, Georgia? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, AllianceBernstein just moved to Nashville, they just announced it. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I got you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: There's other places in the \u2013 I mean other certainly (54:47) Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : (54:47). Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: ...do that Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much for the clarity. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Andy. How are you? Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Great. How are you guys doing? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Awesome. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : And congratulations, Art. I guess you'll get your golf game going, maybe you'll be able to beat Fanning now. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's never been a problem, Andy. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Never been a problem, I hear Tom was a pretty good golfer. And congratulations, Art. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. (55:19) Art is the captain of the Southern Company golf team. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. I'll miss you, Art. You've been very helpful to all of us and will be missed. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Andy. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Obviously, all the questions have mainly been answered. I just have a question on Georgia Power. The $900 million, I understand that, will there be incremental equity that needs to be put down in there to get to the 55% level? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, we've already put it down there as equity, that we will replace it at the Southern level in some form or fashion. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And just as a matter of governance and process, there's always needs for capital contributions to the subs over time, and certainly that would include all of our subs. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: That's right. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So there will be other incremental equity down there in the future, but this speaks to the lion's share... Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : I guess, what I'm getting at \u2013 I'm sorry to interrupt \u2013 but what I'm getting at is to get to the equity ratio where \u2013 if I remember from, like, past comments or conversations with you guys, obviously, the first goal was to try to get the regulatory approval, which, obviously, you got very quickly. And then the second goal was to try to get the equity ratio to the maximum allowed level so you could start earning on that equity as quickly as possible. And so, I guess, what I'm asking is does that $900 million, which you put down into there, does that get you to that maximum equity level or do you need to put more equity down there this year to get to that maximum equity level? Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Andy, yeah, it gets us to approximately the 55% level. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, we're there. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : (57:17) Okay, okay. Because I had come up with a different calculation, that's why I was confused. Okay. Let me see if there's anything else. And then just on the overall equity, you've touched on this before. So on the tax equity, the $1 billion that you plan to get later in the year, that will reduce the equity need from $7 billion \u2013 it's a hard word to say \u2013 down to $6 billion, and then another $350 million or so has been reduced by the sale to American Water Works, so you're down to about $5.5 billion, give or take $100 million. (58:01) Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You got to be careful using gross numbers like on Pivotal, because you always want to first retire the net committed capital associated with each of these companies so that you preserve your earnings profile. And then, to the extent the price is above, that is accretive, and also gives you the notion of net equity proceeds that you could then use to reduce leverage. Yeah. And I know, rightfully so, we gave you the example of the tax equity associated with the wind PTCs, that's one of a portfolio of options we're looking at. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. I understand. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Sir, at this time there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You know what, I'm going to give Art the last word here. Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.: Well, it has certainly been my pleasure to represent Southern Company in front of all you guys on the Street. It's been a rewarding experience for me. But I have to tell you as much fun as that's been, it pales in comparison to watching my grandson play baseball. So I hope you're not offended by that, but that's the truth. But thank you very much for all your courtesies and your help over these past eight years. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Art. That's all we have, operator. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company first quarter 2018 earnings call. You may now all disconnect. Have a great day everyone. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks, everyone.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday August 8, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Melody. Good morning. Welcome to Southern Company's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, second quarter Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during this morning's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Drew and I will cover our usual business updates in a few moments. But first, we'd like to provide an update on Vogtle 3 and 4, reflected in our reported earnings for the second quarter as a $1.1 billion pre-tax charge which represents an increase in Georgia Power share of the projected cost to complete Vogtle 3 and 4. We continue to project construction completion date of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4 respectively and the new cost estimate does not reflect any changes in the project schedule. After Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March 2017, part of Southern Nuclear's new self-perform role was to develop a new cost estimate for completion of the project as Georgia Power and the other owners no longer had the benefit of a fixed and firm EPC contract with its original contractor. This was the first time that Southern Nuclear had brought access to Westinghouse's more detailed cost information, invoices, subcontract and planning and schedule documents, including the basis of estimates being discussed between Fluor and Westinghouse. Southern Nuclear began building what became the VCM 17 estimate to complete or ETC based on data and information obtained from Westinghouse and Fluor as assessed by Southern Nuclear and independently reviewed by its consultants. As a reminder Georgia Power submit Semi-Annual Vogtle Construction Monitoring Reports for VCMs to the Georgia Public Service Commission. These filings and the hearings which follow are an important part of the regulatory framework for the project. The 17th VCM filing in August 2017 was used by the PSC to make its post-Westinghouse bankruptcy go or no-go decision for Vogtle 3 and 4. As with any forecast, the VCM 17 ETC was based heavily on assumptions regarding scope of work, labor productivity and cost escalation. The VCM 17 Report also included discussions of project risks, including an acknowledgement that work was still ongoing on key terms that could impact costs that the craft labor force may be unable to maintain their productivity improvement and that some scope may be unidentified at the time of the ETC. Recognizing the potential for cost increases relating to the transition of the project, Southern Nuclear added cost escalation in the form of contingency to the estimate. This contingency was intended to cover costs expected to be specifically allocable within a reasonably short period of time. Georgia Power submitted the VCM 17 ETC to the Georgia Public Service Commission on August 31 2017. In addition Georgia Power provided the PSC with independent estimates of the cost to complete, which were in general agreement with the Southern Nuclear ETC, following an exhaustive review of the VCM 17 Report, the PSC in December of 2017 approved Georgia Power's recommendation to continue construction. The proposed new project structure and $7.3 billion as a reasonable total cost for Georgia Power's share of completing the project. This cost reflected Southern Nuclear's as initial ETC net of the $1.7 billion Toshiba parent guarantee and partial customer refunds of that guarantee. In the year since completing the initial ETC, Southern Nuclear has been able to maintain project momentum consistent with the schedule approved by the PSC. Although the PSC recognized that the $7.3 billion revised capital cost forecast was not a cost cap, Southern Nuclear undertook efforts to manage the project within that forecast while at the same time sustaining project momentum and transitioning project management. In connection with this effort, Southern Nuclear determined that it needed to implement changes at the project to lower project risks and maintain its schedule. Among others these changes included expanding the scope of Bechtel's contractor duties and resulting fees, increasing field supervision and engineering support and implementing craft labor incentives to attract and retain adequate staffing. The project team has also continued its efforts to firm up other estimated costs, such as the 60-plus subcontracts that had not yet been negotiated at the time of the initial ETC. Many of these new subcontracts reflect changes in market conditions and in some cases increased scope. As part of the process to continually review and assess cost and schedule and based on a years' worth of experience managing the project, Southern Nuclear recently revised its estimate of the cost to complete the project. Based on this latest estimate, we now recognize the previous contingency was insufficient to fully offset forecasted cost increases. The new estimate reflects the Georgia Power's projected share of total costs has increased from $7.3 billion to $8.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion dollars. This increase includes a base capital cost increase of approximately $700 million and a new construction contingency estimate of approximately $400 million. We will continue to monitor and evaluate costs associated with construction of Vogtle 3 and 4 and provide updates on our estimate as appropriate. Although we believe the increased projected costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project we have made the judgment that it's in the best long-term interests of investors, customers and other stakeholders that we not disrupt project momentum by seeking approval of the base capital cost increase so soon after receiving PSC approval to continue with the project. Therefore when Georgia Power files the increased cost estimate with the PSC as part of VCM 19 later this month, Georgia Power will not request recovery of the $700 million in base capital cost increase and precluding these costs from increasing customer rates. Therefore the customer impacts contemplated in VCM 17 remain the same in VCM 19. As to the contingency included in our revised capital cost estimate, which is approximately 35% of the total increase, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate such cost for rate recovery as and when appropriate. We are hopeful that this revised ETC and new contingency will be sufficient to take Vogtle 3 and 4 project to completion. That said, we recognize that a nuclear construction project can continue to experience challenges and that unanticipated events may require further revision to the forecast and project schedules to get to completion. Meanwhile progress on construction continues. Several major milestones have been met and we've achieved scheduled completion date and we continue to project in-service date by November 2021 and November 2022 for Unit 3 and 4 respectively. Our primary construction contractor Bechtel continues to plan work based on a schedule months ahead of these dates. We will continue to monitor and evaluate productivity rates and attracting onboarding and retaining electricians and pipefitters continue to be priorities. We are having success with these initiatives but we have more work to do. Additionally both Southern Nuclear and Westinghouse personnel continue to learn from the now for four AP1000 units in China which have loaded fuel and are currently in state-up phase. I will now ask Drew to provide a few details on the financial aspects of the new project estimate. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Tom. The $1.1 billion pre-tax charge reported for Georgia Power, which translates to a $790 million after-tax charge is an estimate of the increase in future cash expenditures for the project. However, in recognition of our commitment to the credit quality of both Georgia Power and Southern Company, we plan to issue approximately $800 million in incremental common equity through the remainder of 2018. Likewise, Southern Company will contribute this equity down to Georgia Power to maintain its target capital structure and credit profile consistent with the Georgia PSC's Tax Reform Order earlier this year. This incremental equity is expected to come from the types of sources that we've used in the past. While our future financing activities are subject to market conditions and other factors, our current financing plan does not assume any discrete equity offerings or block sales. All else being equal, we project these additional shares to equate to approximately $0.02 of EPS dilution in 2019 and to reach approximately $0.05 by 2020 or 2021 as the project spends and the estimated increase cost to complete are included to complete the project. Even with these efforts, we do not anticipate any change to our 4% to 6% long-term EPS growth rate guidance. We expect to continue evaluating opportunities to offset these effects and optimize our overall financial plan, including additional investor-friendly sources of funds. I will now turn the call back to Tom for a brief update on recent initiatives. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks Drew. In May, we completed the sale of a 33% minority interest stake in Southern Power Solar portfolio and we completed the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions in June. In July, we closed the sales of Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas and Florida City Gas. Cumulatively these transactions accounted for more than $3.7 billion in proceeds. We have completed the appropriate FERC filings for the sales of Gulf Power and Southern Power plants Stanton and Oleander. These regulatory approvals are expected to drive the timing for closing on these transactions. Our current expectation is that both transactions will close during the first half of 2019. We are also making great progress on third-party tax equity financing for the vast majority of Southern Power's existing wind portfolio, which we expect to produce more than $1 billion in proceeds. We hope to close this transaction during the fourth quarter of 2018. Southern Company has demonstrated tremendous discipline as both a buyer and seller of assets. The AGL Resources and Southern Natural Gas transactions, for example, have proved to be terrific complements to our portfolio of companies, further strengthening our expected long-term growth profile. Likewise, our recent divestitures have proven to be an effective source of equity with a significantly lower cost of capital than new common shares. Southern will continue this disciplined approach as we seek to further improve upon our state-regulated utility centric growth profile. And as a final note, yesterday the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved a settlement for Mississippi Power Company PEP filing receiving the majority of the requested amount. Drew will now provide some specifics on our second quarter earnings performance. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Tom. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported a loss of $154 million or $0.15 a share. This compares with a loss of $1.38 billion or $1.38 per share in the second quarter of 2017. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we reported earnings of $784 million or $0.77 per share compared with the loss of $723 million or $0.73 a share for the same period in 2017. Excluding charges associated with Vogtle, Kemper and other items described in our earnings material, earnings for the second quarter of 2018 and the six month period ended June 30, 2018 were $0.80 and $1.69 per share respectively. These results compare with $0.73 and $1.39 per share on an adjusted basis for the same period since 2017. Major year-over-year earnings drivers for adjusted second quarter 2018 results include the positive effects of constructive regulatory outcomes and weather at our state-regulated utilities and increased contributions from Southern Power's renewables fleet. These impacts were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization, as well as operations and maintenance costs. Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I want to provide our outlook for the remainder of 2018. Historically, we have not provided updates to our year end EPS guidance until we report third quarter results. In light of our performance year-to-date, which is tracking ahead of our plans on an adjusted basis and the impacts of reducing our new equity needs with the Florida asset transactions, we're updating our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year 2018 to $2.95 to $3.05. Finally, our estimate for the third quarter adjusted EPS is $1.05. Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks Drew. Once again, I want to thank everyone for being with us this morning. I'm sure you all have many questions regarding the topic we've addressed on today's call. So let's go ahead and open the floor for questions. Operator let's take the first question. Operator : Thank you Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking up our question. Just one thing I noticed in the disclosure in the 10-Q around Vogtle was that you need to have a new vote of the co-owners which needs to come in at 90%. Can you just talk to us Tom about how confident you are around that process and what would happen in the event that one of them didn't come along? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Sure. I have to be very careful not to speak for our co-owners here. There is a governance process that these events trigger that we refer to in the disclosure. Jonathan, the only kind of characterization I can offer, because I want to let their own governance process to speak for themselves, is to say I think that we've had real-time communication with our co-owners and certainly in the past they have been supportive and constructive in our relationship. Beyond that, I really would prefer to let their own process speak for itself. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What's the timing on when you think that will play out? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Certainly it'll be at the very end of the third quarter perhaps into the fourth quarter, but I would expect something late September. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then as to sort of \u2013 you know, I realize you don't want to speak for them, but what would your \u2013 how would it affect your plans if one of them wasn't to move forward? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, based on the current structure, in fact, the Georgia Power Board voted, made a recommendation to the Southern Board, we concur with that. We are moving forward. Anything that was an alternative as a result of any of these governance processes, we just have to take that up at the time. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe, if I could, just one more on the \u2013 looking at the sort of performance slide where you show the metrics. What happened with the top one where it seems to kind of move sharply higher in July? I know there's been some reports that you shutdown work at the site for a day or two. Could you talk about that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That was it. Yeah. That's pretty much it. Look, if you look at kind of the general trend, we've suggested, I think, for a couple of earnings calls now that, while we've been going very well, and in fact, if you go back in time and look at kind of the December 2017 when we were really beating this green line which is predicated on a 21 month schedule or a April 2021, April 2022 completion date. Remember that variance was really because we worked through some periods where we had planned otherwise to have a lot of dislocation in work from holidays. So that's why we've made up a lot there. And then we started saying, certainly as we approach early part of this year, when we start working in some rather confined spaces with the reactor vessel core that we thought that we would see some erosion against that 21 month kind of schedule. The other thing that I think is important earlier this spring would be, we had a ton of rainfall and that impacted our ability to deploy productively. But I think the spike at the end \u2013 you got to be a little careful, this is a four week rolling average, but a lot of that spike may be attributed to the two-day-or-so stand-down on the site. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And what was the story there? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Sure. I think it was just recalibrating all expectations on site, whether it is leadership's oversight of personnel, whether it is the commitment of personnel to complete their task as efficiently as we need, it is medicine that we take from time to time that is painful, but generally produces good long run results. The focus is to meet with year-end completion percentages and we just took tough action to recalibrate personnel on the site to make sure that happens. And I think the results following that have been pretty good. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just finally, you've given this disclosure that electrician and pipefitter staffing is between 85% and 90% of plans. Could you just calibrate that to the prior disclosure where I think you needed to hire 700 of one and 400 of the other by October? I think that was what was in the VCM, like what does the 85% to 90% mean in the context of that target? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's kind of where we are now versus the plan. We need to continue to ramp up. I think our staffing projection would show we reach our peak in November. I think we feel really good about where we are on the pipefitters. I think the electricians is the one that continues to require focus. We have a lot of different arrows in the quiver to address that. We still believe we can hit everything we need. But it goes to getting workers from Canada. It goes to re-segmenting work on site, it goes to perhaps getting personnel from Puerto Rico and other areas. Look, I talk to Brendan Bechtel, either in-person, on the phone, text, e-mail, people on the site are focused on this. We absolutely realize that we need to hit these targets. People remain confident, but I think it is the biggest risk area we face right now. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Do you have a number of how many more you need to hire? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, there is a schedule. I think we can get it for you. I just don't have it right at my fingertips. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: I think the best way to think about it is current populations are at about two-thirds of what the expectation is... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: By November. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: By November. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We can get you more detail on that. It represents about 600 jobs... Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But that two-thirds of November, but 85% to 90% of plan, is that... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's... Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Those are not conflicting comments? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Plan is like where we are now and then we need to add about 600 more by November. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Right. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And is that 600 relative to the 1100 of both categories that was disclosed in the last VCM or relative to the 700? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. It's just the electricians. And yes it is relevant to where we were before. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Sorry to, for all the questions though \u2013 thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, no, great. Thank you, Jonathan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hi, Steve. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, good morning. I think staff or the commission has been saying again that there's not a full integrated project schedule. Could you talk to that, because it seems like that's pretty important having confidence in these numbers? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I would argue that we have a good schedule. We continue to work on refining the schedule, but that's something that is ongoing all the time. In fact, I'm just looking at \u2013 I was just reviewing this morning even. The construction milestones for the rest of the year, there's plenty of detail here and I can go into tens of thousands of lines of detail, but I have 20 big things that have to happen during 2018. And I would argue something like on Unit 3, 18 of the 20 have been met or are expected to be met within the parameters, only two are not. They're off by, on one case, one item a month, another case a little over a month and neither one is critical path. They both have plenty of float left. On Unit 4, 16 out of 20, the variances look like a week, two weeks and three weeks. Again, none of those are critical path. We completed the resource loaded schedule in May. And so this is something that we always \u2013 this is an ongoing process that we always look at refining the schedule and as we see, new expected completion dates or as we see actual performance that's different than planned, we always review the schedule. But I would argue, we do have an integrated schedule right now and we are meeting it. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And just I know the dates are November 2021, 2022 are the same, your schedule had like an earlier timeline. Could you just tell us what your internal schedule is relative to those November dates, is it still seven months ahead or...? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's what we've said before. We've been managing the site to what's called a 21 month, not 29 month. But what that means is April of 2021 for Unit 3 and April of 2022 for Unit 4. That's what we're managing the site to. And the data we show in the metrics that we've had in these earnings calls, I guess really since we've taken over, would show that early on we were even beating the 21 month schedule, the April schedule, that was at the end of 2017 roughly. And we said that we thought that those achievements would be challenged because we're moving into a very tight constrained part of the site, the nuclear reactor vessel is just a much closer environment with a lot of people and a lot of material and we thought that that progress would be challenged, and in fact the data has followed precisely what we've suggested. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: And Steve I'd say that the Direct Schedule Performance Index and the Direct Cost Performance Index that we show you is based on that April time schedule. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just lastly, just could you \u2013 I'm sure you informed the commissioners and political leaders ahead of this, just any reaction from them to this news? Obviously shareholders are absorbing most of it. But could you just... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. Yes we have. I would argue that the commission remains supportive of the project as does the broad political public here in Georgia. If you think about it from a customer economic standpoint, customer impact standpoint, because we're making the tough decision not to include these base capital cost today, the same customer impacts remain today as existed in VCM 17 when this project was approved. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I'll let others ask questions. Thanks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just wanted to talk about the contingency, you mentioned there could be some potential in the future for customers to absorb that. Can you remind me, where are we at the moment in terms of how the commission calculated the net present value to customers of this project? I'm just sort of thinking about the incremental changes to that net present value over time. I just want to level set where we are at the moment. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Somebody should check me after the call, but as I remember the calculations back in the VCM 17, there was something like $2 billion of value to customers by pursuing this course of action. That's what I remember about the present value benefit. If that's not correct or if there are degrees of freedom around that, we'll get back to you. But that's what I remember. And recall... Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: ...that with the action we've taken today that's \u2013 those economics are preserved. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And then I have more of a just a mechanical question around the joint owners. If the joint owners chose not to move forward and Southern Company chose to move forward, mechanically, how is that handled like a little rusty own how that would sort of mechanically work its way through? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. So the technical answer there is that the project would be deemed to be cancelled I believe. And then of course, you could take a variety of different paths beyond that. But the technical answer is, if you don't get the 90% vote the project is cancelled. Then you have to figure out how or whether to proceed beyond that. There is no prescription per se beyond that action. Of course, we could all negotiate whatever but that would also require Public Service Commission approval and a variety of other things. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. So Tom, in that scenario would that likely involve Commission involvement in terms of reviewing the plan at that point if the project is technically cancelled? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Of course. Yes it would, of course. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's all. That's all I have. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. So just following-up on Georgia Power's balance sheet just in terms of the authorized equity ratios and how you're thinking about the latest write-off, I know you talked about corporate level equity at this point. Can you just specify how you're thinking about financing at that level and just how you think about that perhaps having an impact on next year's rate case, if at all? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. You may recall that Georgia Power reached an agreement with the Public Service Commission following the new tax legislation. It was constructive and was designed to support their credit quality, which is so important as we think about building a asset like Vogtle 3 and 4. The solution in order to reach a similar FFO to debt calculation was to increase the equity ratio from 50% to about 55%. They put that in place effective immediately essentially, and also said that they would address it again later in the 2019 rate case. So we've been down streaming equity into Georgia per that order. And the plans that we've laid in front of you today that relate to the $800 million additional equity requirement also are consistent with that plan. And just to review the bidding, because I think it's informative. When we got the new tax law, we thought it was going to be about $7 billion of incremental equity across the system and that was associated with also increased equity ratios. With the transaction that we announced with NextEra, we essentially took $3 billion off the table, in other words we were carrying about assets that were worth about $3.5 billion in our current valuation and sold them for about $6.5 billion. So the $3 billion netted against any future equity requirement. Further, we announced the forward sale to tax equity of the production tax credits associated with wind that's another $1 billion. So the $7 billion was reduced by $3 billion and then reduced by the $1 billion, and so it is now net $3 billion. When we think about the actions that we are taking this morning and the additional $800 million, the $3 billion becomes $3.8 billion. And what we said earlier in our opening comments is that we still don't believe that requires any block sales and we believe that we can handle this therefore with at the market sales, or our normal plans as well as investor-friendly equity. We think we've got plenty of gunpowder to handle this issue. From an EPS standpoint, the effect this year and we've increased the equity in the EPS range from $2.80-$2.95 now to $2.95-$3.05. We think the dilutive effect of this action today is only about a $0.01 this year, but within the $2.95 to $3.05, $0.02 in 2019 and $0.05 kind of thereafter. And what we also said is we will undertake plans to reduce, eliminate that effect. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: And Julien just to give you a little bit of this \u2013 a flavor of this mechanically because look the expenses are probable, we will take that write-down at Georgia Power reduces equity, we will \u2013 however it is paid out over time, this is part of our future expectation for constructed costs. But because we want to maintain the capitalization there for regulatory purposes, we will inject the $800 million today. This will improve FFO to debt in the near term, but certainly the expectation is that it will be used to fund construction over the longer-term. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And just to underline what Drew is saying that what we have done today is made a new estimate to complete. Those are dealing with not actual expenditures per se, but rather future expenditures. But we're taking the action immediately to improve the balance sheet. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So from a cash standpoint, there's a difference, it actually works to our credit quality advantage. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Let me clarify this just to be exceptionally clear cut about this. The $0.05 that you just talk about over time, none of that pertains to any change in the earnings ability for the asset itself, right, this doesn't change any of the basically tracker earnings, this is simply a question of balance sheet and dilution effect. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's exactly right. It only relates to the incremental equity that we're using in order to preserve credit quality. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And sort of to clarify earlier your response to Steve's question on the tight construction period here. Can you elaborate a little bit more on when we're going to be \"through that\" if you will, right? I suppose over the next little bit, you seem to describe that it's a particularly difficult stretch of construction. When do you anticipate to be through it per your definition? And more importantly to that also the hiring ramp as well in tandem, right, I suppose both seemed to go hand-in-hand with the schedule. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. I think the next 18 months Julien are where we're seeing the big intensive pressure. After about 18 months we see a pretty good ramp down in terms of staffing et cetera on the site, so something like that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I'll let it there. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please proceed. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. Just to follow-up on the dilution and offsetting it with \u2013 offsetting the $0.05 out in the future. Is that mostly going to come from cost cutting or is that part additional project growth and rate based growth such as thinking like the grand (39:40) mechanism in Georgia, what do you see is offsetting the dilutive impact? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You know it's all that and potentially investor-friendly equity, as we've discussed before. Just pick Elizabethtown for example, I think AGL made a heck of an acquisition there in the past and your carrying value there I'm looking at Drew, it was around $700 million, you sold it for $1.7 billion. So you picked up about $1 billion solely on Elizabethtown. As I described the economics of the Florida transaction, we picked up $3 billion there. The other thing that I think is important to note, our cost position we should think about it company-by-company for example Georgia Power, remember basically postponed an action in 2016, with its normal three year accounting order process that's pushed into 2019. Georgia Power's already done a whole lot of cost management, have been able to maintain an earnings profile that's been really good. And in fact by our own data Georgia Power, which showed their cost metrics are about top quartile in the industry. And the other thing that you should see as an evidence when we talk about improving our earnings range, I hope, I'm really encouraging us all not to treat this as a precedent, but because our numbers are so far ahead of our original guidance, we decided to give you new guidance at this call. Normally, our process has been that we give original guidance at the yearend calls, which has been the end of January, early February. And we only update that in our October call, after we get through the summer months. That has been our process really even going back to my days as CFO. We were just so far ahead, $0.30 ahead that we felt we ought to go ahead and change the guidance from $2.80-$2.95 to $2.95-$3.05. Part of that performance has been our performance on cost recognition and the whole modernization effort. So I think that, Michael I think it's all the above. I think its cost management. I think it is the deployment of modernization to give us greater resilience, better customer service, increased CapEx and then of course investor-friendly equity. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. And a follow-up on Julien's question, what do you see as the next big cost pressure coming up over the next 18 months? I guess right now we're in the middle of a kind of a labor squeeze. What's the most expensive item over this next 18 months that you're going to be monitoring going forward, is there a particular piece of equipment or type of integration that's happening that'd be particularly costly? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You know it isn't so much of that, because we have all the major equipment in place. It really deals with what we've been saying for some time now. And that is our ability to deploy labor productively onsite. That's going to help us get to our schedule and that has certainly cost ramifications. We've got to keep productivity on the site up, and actually improve the amount of hours worked every month onsite as we get through this ramp-up process into November and then for the next 18 months. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. So there's no critical path item as there was when we were still installing modules? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, no, no, there is always critical path. I mean critical path by definition is whatever work is required that really sets the timeframe in which you will be ready to go in service. For example, remember I just mentioned 20 major construction milestones this year for Unit 3 and Unit 4 and I gave a broad outline when I was talking to Fleishman. The critical path right now within the Auxiliary Building and that kind of critical path because successful completion on time of the Auxiliary Building allows us to begin testing of the major other components, which will set the timeframe for the rest of the schedule. We have no major material component. Everything is onsite. It's really a matter of putting it together at this point. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. Sorry, if you said this before. I mean, when is your Auxiliary Building part of it going to be completed and through that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Let's see, well, I'm looking through the end of this year. We have kind of by November 2029 and we're ahead \u2013 the schedule right now we call for December of 2018 for essentially the control room in the Auxiliary Building to be in play and we're actually beating that right now. And that's based on the April schedule. We are beating it by not a whole lot, by about a week on each of the concrete floors et cetera. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. All right, thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, Tom. Thank you for taking my question. I'm sure you're privy or have seen data especially given your role with the Federal Reserve down there about labor conditions and the broader market. Just curious, how would you compare the labor differences that you're seeing at Vogtle 3 and 4 versus what kind of other large either manufacturing or industrial construction projects in the region are seeing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah right. I think what we're seeing is skilled labor is kind of the most intense part. It's a fascinating question. We are seeing kind of a spotty labor constraints around the United States. So IT, high skill manual labor, pipefitters, electricians, electricians specifically because there's other activity going on around the United States. And it's requiring something special to draw those people to the sites, that is one of the big change conditions that we have seen since the original ETC was put in place that we're reflecting today. The per diems that we have put in place appear to be working. We do appear to be attracting more people. And interestingly, our turnover once we've gotten them onsite has been cut in half. So we have been seeing turnover kind of over 10%, 12% somewhere in there. Turnover now around 6%, so \u2013 6% or 7% somewhere around there. But anyway we're able to attract and retain better with these per diems. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's super helpful. And Tom, one follow-up and hate to ask this, but almost have to, given what's going on in the neighboring state... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Ask away. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ...two states over. What in the original nuclear law from 2007, 2008 is the process for potential cost recovery if the project is abandoned during construction? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. We have law in place that basically says any prudently incurred cost is recoverable. And recall there are at least three segments of costs that have been ruled on over time up to \u2013 I hope I get these numbers right, up to about $4.5 billion or so have already been deemed to be prudent. Up to about $5.7 billion or so have been \u2013 wait, up to about $4 billion have been found prudent, up to about $5.7 billion or so have been presumed to be prudent. And then up to the $7.3 billion, they are deemed to be reasonable, but the burden is still on us to prove prudence. I think those are the three separate buckets. And if I've missed any of those numbers on those buckets somebody correct me, but I think broadly that's where we are. And the prudent would determine that it is recoverable. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And is there a set regulatory process to go through that was laid out in the legislation or is it just kind of enabling legislation and the owners and the PSC would kind of have to figure out what the process or docket would look like? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: The PSC will make the prudence determination and then it will apply against law. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciate it. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Your line is open. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Tom. Have any events in the past triggered a co-owner vote that you needed the 90% majority? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. I guess there's two triggers that we think about. One is a new ETC in excess of $1 billion, $1 billion or more. And the other one I think relates to a lack of recoverability. And in fact... Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Tom, early... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And Paul one other issue, this two-trigger feature was an agreement that was modified last year at the time we decided to go forward. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And I think you earlier said that you would not seek $700 million of the $1.1 billion, what about the $400 million contingency? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. So it's essentially this determination. We think of the $700 million they were prudently incurred and reasonable, okay, but because of the proximity to VCM 17, we think for the good of everything going forward and in order to maintain momentum, we're not seeking recovery. With respect to the $400 million, contingency has never been part of \u2013 in a broad sense part of the allowed costs. What the Commission likes to do in the practice of the staff and frankly we followed that because contingency by its nature is something that we think we'll spend, but we don't know what it is just yet, we don't include those. As these costs become known then we would submit them for recovery. But the $400 million right now is an estimate, but we don't know where we will spend it. As we know more, we preserve the right to ask the Commission for recovery. There is no cost cap. That's been proven before by law in VCM 12 and 17. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then lastly, you kind of blew right through your guidance, what were the big drivers relative to your thinking on the last call? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, it was really two things. One was kind of the success we had with the sale of assets to NextEra and the lack of having to issue new equity this year. And the second was the success of our modernization efforts. That is kind of the dual issue of cost management and increasing CapEx to improve resilience and customer service. Drew? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah. I'd say, one of the largest items is the success we've had with tax reform implications in each of the state regulatory jurisdictions. And so we've seen very positive and productive outcomes from Georgia in particular that relates to both the power and the gas LDC and also in Alabama. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I know that added $0.03 in the first quarter and $0.05 this quarter. What do you think the full year impact of that would be? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Pretty decent run rate, as you've seen in the third quarter as a lot of the stuff matures. The biggest driver in the future will be the increase in equity content in the Alabama utility \u2013 in Alabama Power and so we'll just have to track that through the next couple of quarters. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. First question, Tom as you said, your equity needs previously had come down to $3 billion and now they are $3.8 billion with this extra $800 million. Can you just remind us how we should think about that? You know the $800 million obviously comes this year, but the base $3 billion, should we assume that sort of evenly distributed over the five years or how should we be thinking about how that equity gets layered over the years? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Ali, I think that's probably a fair way to think about it. We'll use our traditional programs of dividend reinvestment and then also sort of an at-the-market program that will begin shortly. But our intent is to move that equity out commensurate with some of the spend that we're doing. And even though our projection has changed, the 36-month timeframe really is intact. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, it's a reasonable modeling assumption, just to put that in ratably. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Okay. And how much have you done if any through the first half of this year? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Less than a couple of hundred million. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And also then to clarify the comment that as you pointed out, you had this \u2013 if you model it out, there is the $0.05 dilution that comes in from the extra equity, and you've talked about keeping the 4% to 6% growth rate intact. So is the implication that you're going to offset that $0.05 or is it that even with the $0.05 dilution, you're still within the 4% to 6% range? I want to be clear what you were conveying there. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, yeah. No, it's a good point of clarification. If we did nothing to take away the impact of the $0.05 long-term, this is in the 2020-2021 timeframe we are still within the 4% to 6%. Okay. And we intend to diminish that impact over time through our actions, through modernization, special investor-friendly equity or whatever. So, even without any effort to eliminate, reduced the $0.05 we're still within the 4% to 6%. My point is we're going to attack that with great vigor. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Got it. And then with regards to the investor-friendly equity, Tom, if you look at your portfolio, are the opportunities more at the Southern Power level? I know you're monetizing the wind, you're getting $1 billion from that, are they at the gas level? Is there more to be done on electric, can you just give us a sense of where there is opportunity in that portfolio? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. I think we've kind of shown our hand. If you look at our portfolio, Ali as you have, we have been I think very disciplined buyers and sellers. Recently, it has been Elizabethtown and then the set of assets to NextEra, where NextEra I think had special interest in pursuing some assets. We think we've got an argument anyway that a lot of our assets are undervalued in our current valuation. I think if you projected kind of Elizabethtown values on all of our gas assets you would have a different valuation for Southern Company. What we're able to do, I think is to be proactive and monetize some assets at higher valuations than otherwise you would expect to see as if we issued equity on our own. That has been the core. Everything we have done from an investor-friendly standpoint has been accretive. We think we still have the capability to do that, when you look at the different pieces of our portfolio. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: And Ali, we're asked this question quite a bit. What's core and what's non-core? And reality is that it's \u2013 the simple answer is that it is all core. There are certainly some things around the edges at the margin that we have to be responsive to, but we think we've built a portfolio of assets that we really enjoy operating. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Last question is more mechanical, if you will. Your effective tax rate on an adjusted basis seems to be coming in lower than what we had. For modeling purposes what is the right effective tax rate we should be using for the adjusted earnings trajectory? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Generally right around 21%. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: 21%. Got it. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question. Your line is open. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Angie, Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. How are you? Okay. So, two things. One is, so it looks like the increase in the cost estimate has to do with labor-related issues and supervisions et cetera, but nothing to do with actually steel prices et cetera. So I'm just wondering if that's a next issue that might arise. And secondly, on the financing of the incremental equity with potential asset divestitures, I mean, I understand that you can get very good prices for some of your assets. But by shrinking the company in essence, you are increasing your exposure to this project in a sense. And so I mean, I know that it actually might be still prepared to issuing straight up equity, but just if you could share your thoughts on these two topics. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Angie, that's a great question. In fact let me just hit that one first and I will come back to your first one I think. When you think about \u2013 another way to think about what we did with the Florida assets, we sold 5% of our earnings that goes to your point of, well you are increasing your exposure, but we sold 5% of our earnings at that time about 12% of our market cap. It was enormously accretive. And when you think about exposure to earnings when we do accretive things, it actually decreases the exposure from an accretion dilution standpoint. So I think when you look at the results cash Elizabethtown same thing, it was the highest valuation ever paid to our knowledge anyway, 37 times earnings on a gas distribution asset. So I think the way you should view any sort of these investor-friendly divestitures have been, it's not sales at the market, because sales at the market would do exactly what you're suggesting. These are sales well above our current valuation and therefore they are accretive and they are accretive to the point of overcoming any exposure \u2013 any increased exposure to Vogtle 3 and 4. I think the math will bear that out pretty clearly. On the first part of your question, you referred to steel play. Let me be very clear with everybody. And I think we've said this in several calls that the major equipment is onsite, we don't have big exposure to that. We do have almost \u2013 I guess most of our steel is already purchased. We do have commodities, but we think we're accounting for that in this estimate. And the commodities go to the really small things. It goes to the small pipe, it goes to the wire and cable. I think the issue really does go more to deployment of productive labor onsite and maintaining hours worked per month so that we can hit the schedule and everything else that we adhere to. And so far our estimate of schedule remains at \u2013 we are confident on 29 months and we're performing ahead of that right now. So I guess that's what I'd say. Even the subcontracts, which was a big part of what we started seeing here in late May, when we started letting out the subcontracts and they turned out to be significantly above cost from what we estimated in the original ETC those tend to be labor related as well. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Did I \u2013 yeah. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So just one follow-up. So how do you come up with those contingencies? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Sure. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I mean, it's tough for us to say if $400 million is actually a large contingency or not. And it seems like your previous estimate was perceived to be very conservative and also included contingencies and now, I mean, yeah, I mean just how can we actually get appeased by this one? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Again it's a terrific question, and one, we ask ourselves all the time, how do you know you got enough? When we did the original estimate, you may remember from all the work we did that we had lots of different input into that estimate. And I think I kind of covered some of this in the script, but more specifically we had the input of a variety of consultants. We had a completely separate path of a different consultant give us their own estimate of what ETC would be. And then, we took the ETC and went through the regulatory process. Even the independent monitor was thoroughly debated; even the independent monitor thought it was reasonable in the process that we followed with sound. So we think we did a reasonable effort at the time that we made the ETC. At this new estimate, when we started seeing, as I mentioned before, trends that showed our contingency original was getting consumed faster than we thought, and especially in late May when we started getting feedback on the subcontract that we got from Westinghouse, I can tell you when we first got the Passover from Westinghouse of subcontract, we said, gosh let's add 50%. Well now in hindsight, we think we should have added over a 100% cost. And in some cases not just the cost, but the scope has been bigger than what we expected. We had KPMG take another look at our new estimate in terms of contingency. We've worked with Bechtel and others. We developed something we call a risk register. And what we do in the risk register, for items that we don't have complete transparency on, although we know where we believe they will be, we actually take a range of a low and a high and we perform analysis as to probabilities and we come up with a probability weighted contingency estimate. This is essentially how we developed the estimate. We look at line items, we involve site management and we include it in an overall assessment as to the project. Does this 35% contingency as per the $1.1 billion increase look reasonable? So we do all the kind of quantitative testing. We do the qualitative judgment kind of testing. To the best of our ability, we think we've got a sound estimate here. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And the last question, okay, so shareholders are eating the $700 million. Now you're about to file the VCM report. I thought that those reports are actually just to true up the actual cost of the project and given that as you said there's no cap, I mean what kind of assurance we have that next VCM is filed and there is another cost increase and another portion of that cost step up has been absorbed by shareholders. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. So we're taking a reserve today for the entire amount of the $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis. Okay. So that is a tacit acknowledgement that we're not seeking recovery of the $700 million base capital increase. It does not address the contingency that is the $400 million balance, and that's because we don't know exactly how, when, what we will incur those costs. We believe it is a reasonable estimate of what may occur. Therefore, we include it in the reserve. But because we don't have knowledge, we can't ask for recovery yet. So we've taken an income affect for the whole amount. As we go through each VCM and as we start to eat into that contingency there will be some analysis of whether we get to recover those costs or not. But we've already taken the accounting hit for it. Okay. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes. Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And let me add one last thing just to say it again the $700 million that we've identified that we are not seeking recovery was really due to our judgment on maintaining project momentum and its proximity to the December 2017 decision by the PSC. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Angie. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks for joining us. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Hi, guys and thanks for sitting through the marathon session. I know it's not easy. Just coming back to Vogtle and just stepping back a little bit right. The expectation was that most of the risks were managed at this point and it's more of a regular construction project. And now we have such a big cost increase. It almost seems like the unknown is what we're kind of dealing with right, the consultants haven't dealt with it before, obviously your team hasn't done these kind of projects before. How do we get comfortable and how do you at your stage, I know you've clearly done the contingency and you've kind of fought through it, but at some point there is a level of unknown in these projects that everybody's dealing with. And so how do you get comfortable with it and how do you manage that risk that every other earnings call we don't have some concern on incremental cost that was just unknown that we just \u2013 it's something new that's come up? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Praful, thanks for that. Very reasonable question. Look I think we should take comfort in that. Well, yeah, we should take comfort in that we've been onsite now in this role now for about a year. And for a lot of the estimates that we used in developing the ETC they are no longer estimates they are reasonably known. In other words, I want to say of the subcontracts, we have about 75% of them are pretty well known, in other words actual and all that. There is still 25% or so, 30% somewhere in that range where we've gone out on the subcontract and at least we know bandwidths of where we think they'll come back. Now we still have time and material situations and we've got to be productive in terms of how we follow that work because a lot of the subcontract work depends on the work that Bechtel does and so maintaining schedule is so important. I think one other thing you can take some comfort in is that the schedule part of this has still been working pretty well although as we continue to say, we're in the challenged part of that schedule. So our actual performance is better than kind of the November timeframe. But still that's the part that we're really focused on. The other thing that I think you should take some comfort in is that we do have essentially a complete design. We do have a technology that is being demonstrated right now with 4 units at least being in start-up in China. I think there are a lot of factors that cause us to have a lot more confidence today and the fact that we've taken additional contingency 35% of this new estimate. Now having said all that, I got to acknowledge and we've seen it before, we don't know our future conditions and we don't know, how all this will turn out, what we're giving you is our \u2013 is I think the most reasonable judgment we can make with additional contingency. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Fair enough. Understood. And secondly, in terms of asset sales or potential asset sales as you look to fund some of the equity need, one of the points you made earlier on one of the questions was that it's accretive because it's relative to where Southern is trading, the value you're getting for those assets is clearly at a higher multiple. But I'm sure when you look at it internally, you don't value your entire portfolio within Southern at the same multiple as in different pieces within your business are trading at different multiples. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Absolutely. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So it's really probably unfair to compare it to Southern consolidated multiple. So I just wanted to check when you compare and when you try to look at, okay, what is an accretive price and as you look to divest assets, how are you kind of benchmarking the right multiple? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Praful, it's absolutely right. I'm just trying to use something that everybody else can see. Okay. I'm just trying to use a reasonable benchmark that people can look at, when you look at 37 times earnings in an LDC, I think everybody would say, well, gosh, relative to kind of how it would be \u2013 how we \u2013 essentially, if you look at the buy and sell, what we bought it for and what we're selling it for is pretty clear that we bought very well with both AGL and SONAD and in that we've sold very well in respect of the pieces of those assets. And in respect to that, they are enormously accretive. I would just give you anecdotal information, even Florida City kind of went off at about the second highest multiple ever paid for an LDC with the first being Elizabethtown. It was pretty close to the Piedmont price. The Gulf price to our knowledge anyway was the highest multiple paid for an electric asset. And we think there were certain conditions and NextEra which made them willing to pay those prices. You're absolutely right. We certainly have a risk return profile for every asset that we own and those are unique as per every asset that would include every asset owned by Southern Power for example. So your point is exactly right. My shorthand and talking through just is something that everybody can point to on the Street without knowing the vagaries of how we value every asset internally. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: And I think that's pretty consistent with what you always talk about, Tom, in terms of risk and return. And Praful we focus really on evaluating the growth of an asset. It's opportunity for investment, its scale and its scope. And so it really is a multi-variable equation. We do have to compare it to the costs to our shareholders of issuing additional equity. I think we feel comfortable certainly in the $3.8 billion that Tom talked about today that that really is equity that can be issued in normal course without a lot of pressure, but we will still evaluate all options versus five or six major investment criteria within the core, but we have to take advantage of dislocations where the market is valuing certain segments of the portfolio maybe more aggressively than others. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Understood. Thanks guys and surely you have done a great job with the asset sales there, so appreciate that. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Appreciate your questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed. Your line is open. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Ashar. Ashar Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC : Hi, good morning. How are you doing? I was just trying to get a better sense of the earning powers going forward if I can. So if I understand correctly the earnings that you have improved for this year, as you said are four factors, which is lower dilution from equity and better earnings from your subsidiaries because of the plans. So can one say that this is probably the right base from which one has to build going forward? Except I don't know if you can help us that from the asset sales that you have announced to-date and which I think so will not be part of the earnings profile going forward, how much earnings do we lose from the assets that you have announced for sale or have completed sales, which is in 2018 forecast? And if you were to take them out and do a pro forma for those asset sales that have been announced or will be completed as part of the NextEra transactions, how much earnings do we lose from the 2018 guidance? Can you help us on that on a dollar basis? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sure. Yeah, Drew and \u2013 I'm looking at Drew, so let me take the first shot and let you correct it or whatever. Go back to the math I gave you on the Florida transactions, we sold 5% of our earnings and we got for, 12% of market cap at the time. The offset of the equity and therefore the $3 billion incremental value we generated by that transaction was way more accretive, $0.10 in this case, $0.10 plus actually than the lost earnings. Okay. So if you just remove Gulf Power you lose earnings of X, but we're able to increase earnings by over $0.10 because of the value we created by the transaction. Okay. So that takes into account all of the removal of equity and debt and everything underlying, the earnings of an asset. And because the price was so high, it was accretive, even removing those earnings. And what we're able to... Ashar Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC : It was accretive by $0.10 or what is the accretion exact? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. What we said on the Florida transaction, the one with NextEra was \u2013 it was actually $0.10 and actually a little better than that and what we did with the $0.10, we took about half of that and we applied that against further reductions in debt to give us even more margin on the FFO to debt calculation. We really wanted to build a little shock absorber into our credit quality. The second part, therefore, the remaining $0.05 or so, improved our ability to earn within the 4% to 6% range. Recall we had established the 4% to 6% range, then we did the Florida assets, then we said we're still within the 4% to 6%. So conceptually we moved higher within the range. And then what we said as a result of this transaction, there's kind of $0.05, if we don't do anything, there's $0.05 negative carry beginning around 2020-2021 somewhere in there. And we said, we're still within the range, even if we do nothing. And then, what I said was, we will work very hard to lessen or eliminate that effect. And what we said was a continuation of our modernization plans, which were partially the engine for improving our earnings this year as well as investor-friendly equity and other strategies. Drew, improve that answer. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Well, maybe I'll try to answer a couple of the specifics that you asked related to what we've based-off of and what the implications are. And if you think back sort of the seminal event for us was tax reform which led to a pretty substantial equity requirement so that we could maintain credit quality of each of the underlying utility subsidiaries and so generally when we talk about growth it is off of the 2017 baseline that that established. And as Tom said, we've been working toward a 4% to 6% range. We felt like the opportunistic sale of the Florida properties reduced the equity burden and pushed us further up into the 4% to 6% range. Certainly, this write-down of about $800 million and its required equity raise moves us down a little bit more within that range, but still within the range. And our goal is to offset a lot of that activity or a little bit of that dilution with internal activities related to modernization, cost control and a variety of other factors. So I think, generally when you think about the loss in net income for those things, they are as we've described 4% to 5%, but the impact on EPS and our expected growth rate is basically unchanged. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Ashar, and I know you know this. But let me just remind us all for the record here. While we are in this construction period in Vogtle as part of the settlement to go forward, Georgia has some reduced earnings rates, once all the assets clears to in-service for Units 3 and 4 we go back to the normal earnings rates. And so there is a little bit of a shake also to our year-by-year earnings. But I know you're aware of that. Ashar Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC : No, I'm aware \u2013 I was just trying, Tom, to build up my 2019 earnings profile for you. And so, if I'm doing it correctly, I guess I wanted to do it before you announce it and I'm not surprised in the February call is that it seems like that the things that you have taken, or the actions you have taken, the accretion is more frontend loaded. And with this transaction that is announced as you said the dilution which you will offset, even if the dilution comes, its way backend loaded in the third year or so. So in essence, as we have started the year and where we are right now in the first week of August, there is more upfront accretion from the asset sales which should help the earnings profile in the near-term. And I just wanted to make sure my conclusion on that or the way I'm going is correct or wrong? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And Ashar, of course as with past practice we'd be glad to follow-up with you after the call to kind of refine that. Ashar Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC : Okay. Thank you so much. So kind of you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you sir. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Can you hear me? Hey. How you doing? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes sir. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So just really quickly back on Vogtle. When we are looking at the cost increase, is there a breakdown I guess on sort of productivity and efficiency versus just sort of pure \u2013 the cost of the labor itself in terms of the price increase that you sort of hadn't anticipated? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I'm sorry, ask that one again. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Well is there \u2013 sort of a \u2013 do you have a breakdown in terms of the sort of the efficiency or the productivity in other words there's a lot more people that you have to employ to sort of get a job done versus just sort of the increase it sounded like that you guys were experiencing in terms of labor costs than what you had previously expected. Do I understand that correctly that that's sort of the two components? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, that's right. You know Paul, one of the things that we're involved with right now that we are keeping our eyes on like hawks is the amount of productive hours worked in a month. So I would say we're kind of in the 85,000 hours a month right now. We need to get that up to November by I don't know a 125,000. That's kind of the ramp-up that we are currently in. And so there's really two factors there, right. One is getting workers on the site, so that's the earlier dialogue that we shared about pipefitters and electricians and all that. And the second thing is once we get people onsite getting them to do productive work. So making sure that if there're X-hours in a day that we actually turn wrenches and produce results in accordance with what we think. That's kind of the trend that we are following right now and that will drive certainly schedule, which we're ahead of right now and cost. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So you're ahead of schedule, that's sort of my follow-up is that, so because you are ahead of schedule, is that why these additional hurdles that you're seeing in terms of productivity what have you, aren't delaying your in-service date, is that how we should \u2013 I mean not extending the in-service date, do you follow what I am saying, I mean, why is it that you guys are having these cost issues, but it doesn't seem to be impacting the schedule? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, if you think about it Bechtel, the Cost Performance Index really relates to work being performed by Bechtel and we are above the 1 there. But Bechtel has a contract which has its own contingency and has its own. I think if you think \u2013 I think the benchmark that we talk about internally is Bechtel on a 29 month schedule is about 1.4 or so, somewhere around there. We'd like to get them certainly below. We've been talking about 1.22, we'd like to get below 1.2, in order to keep our performance ahead of schedule as we've been saying. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: I think it's also fair to say that a lot of, about half of the cost increase that we're taking, is in an effort to stay on track and lower the schedule risk that's there. And so that does include wage inflations per diems, specialized trade a lot of the activity and what we're performing is the completion of these projects in November of 2021. And that's certainly going to be a big component of why we've decided to spend these additional funds. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, and Paul just another way to attack this thing. If you go back to this graph I guess it's page 11 or whatever, but if that number, this cost performance index is at 1.24 that would indicate about a \u2013 let me just do this, June schedule somewhere around there. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then just in terms of regulatory. Have you guys foreclosed \u2013 I mean, just to make sure that I understand this, have you guys foreclosed any recovery associated with this additional cost or is it that you're just simply not going to be seeking it now.... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. We are clear that we are not going to seek recovery on the $700 million. We are reserving the right because there is no cost cap, on the $400 million contingency. The reason that we have not included that in any estimate is really part of our past practice, the Commission or the staff likes to approve contingency, as contingency becomes a real expenditure, we will then decide whether it is reasonable and subject to recovery. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator, any more questions? Operator : No. At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Thanks everybody for joining us today. Certainly, this is not news that we welcome. I think it represents a reasonable estimate as to how to proceed. I think it preserves our regulatory relationships. I think it preserves, I think an equitable assessment of our stakeholders. I know that's painful as a shareholder. But I think in the short run this is pain that is worthwhile in order to preserve long run performance. And I think we've demonstrated the long run impacts here with the discussion around really even current EPS performance and how we've blown through the top of our set range with all the good work we've done this year with the Florida transaction and with our own modernization efforts, but also a nod to the future effects of this announcement today. And I think it's our opinion that this action today preserves the best long-term value for our shareholders, short-term pain, but long-term gain. We think we're able to maintain this performance and provide, I think, a very attractive risk return profile to investors. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We look forward to chatting with you soon. Operator, that's all. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company's second quarter 2018 earnings call.

Please note as well, ladies and gentlemen, that today's conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 7, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill - The Southern Co.: Thank you, Bridgette. Good morning, and welcome to The Southern Company's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements including those discussed in the Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as our slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss today will be viewed on the Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a solid quarter. Our premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities as well as our competitive generation subsidiary, Southern Power, continued to perform well and we remain on track to deliver adjusted results that are well above our original expectations. While our financial performance this year is notable we are particularly proud of how our employees performed before, during and after the recent severe weather events. The resolve and professionalism of our employees has never been more evident than as demonstrated through recent restoration efforts in Alabama, Florida and Georgia, following Hurricane Michael. Hurricane Michael was the strongest hurricane ever to come ashore in Northwest Florida packing maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour, and a powerful 14-foot storm surge that left devastation across the panhandle of Florida. The destruction continued inland as Michael maintained Category 3 strength as it moved into Georgia and Alabama, another first-time event. Immediately following the storm, more than 600,000 customers were without power across our service territory. Storm restoration to customers of Alabama Power and Georgia Power was accomplished within three days of the storm. For Gulf Power, the effort included similar results for the service area which could be restored; however, much of their system around the Panama City area, had to be entirely rebuilt. This rebuild effort was accomplished within 13 days, some 30 hours ahead of the estimated time to complete. This extraordinary effort was not only a testament of the hard work and dedication of over 12,000 Southern Company personnel, but also included the critical contributions of over 35,000 personnel from 27 states and Canada who assisted with the restoration efforts. We owe these hardworking men and women a debt of gratitude for their commitment and personal sacrifice. The successful collaboration of our public and private partnership with the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Energy resulted in what we would consider an historic textbook restoration effort. Before I turn the call over to Drew for a review of our financial results, I'd like to first provide a few key updates. First, an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. On August 21, the Georgia Public Service Commission voted unanimously to approve Georgia Power's VCM 18 filing for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Subsequent to that approval, Georgia Power filed its 19 VCM report beginning a review process, which is expected to conclude in February of 2019. A full schedule for the VCM 19 proceedings is included in the appendix of the slide deck for this call. Additionally, on September 26, all four Vogtle project co-owners voted to continue construction on Units 3 and 4. This commitment means that we will continue forward with the construction of the project which is critical to Georgia's and our nation's energy future. While there have been and will be challenges, we remain committed to safely completing both units and maintaining constructive relationships with our partners along the way. Let's now move on to the progress at the site. The revised total project capital cost forecast including contingency communicated in the second quarter earnings call remains unchanged including no assignment of the contingency estimate. We have continued to firm up subcontract costs and now have executed contracts for approximately 95% of estimated subcontract cost compared to approximately two-thirds as of our last earnings call. Recall that the approved in-service dates for Units 3 and 4 are November 2021 and November 2022, respectively. However, we continued to manage the site's planned work based on an accelerated completion date of April 2021 and April 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively, to preserve schedule margin. While some weekly results were impacted by Hurricane Florence and Michael, we have otherwise seen sustained improvement in productivity since the site stand-down and reset in late July. Since Bechtel became the primary construction contractor in October 2017, the cumulative schedule performance index and cost performance index are currently at 1.02 and 1.17, respectively. More recent weekly performance at the site resulted in SPI in-line with historical performance and a significant improvement in CPI compared to long term averages. We continue to view these two measures as the best indicators of performance at the site as they consider the collective impacts of productivity of the craft labor and staffing levels. Productivity is a key element of the project performance, in that it ultimately determines the number of resources that we will need to successfully complete the project. Focus at the site on key schedule drivers including the ramp-up of craft labor, productivity, system turnover and continuing to build upon the workable backlog to ensure maximum productivity. Most productivity improvements including weekly earned hours above 110,000 have come from the existing workforce. In fact, last week we achieved 120,000 earned hours, a new site record. This compares to approximately 80,000 weekly earned hours prior to the site's stand-down and reset this past July. We're continuing efforts to ramp up staffing levels to meet the earned hours planned in the accelerated schedule. Our objective is to achieve and maintain those levels from spring 2019 through spring of 2020 as we approach Unit 3 hot functional testing. We have several craft labor recruitment efforts under way, both domestically and internationally, and we are having success with the Helping Hands program, utilizing other trades to augment the electrician workforce on-site. Overall, the project is approximately 71% complete, including 58% of construction. We've included a list of future milestones in our slide deck. Since our last earnings call, all of our major milestones have been accomplished in support of our accelerated schedule on-site. Meanwhile, the Sanmen 1 and Haiyang 1 units in China have both achieved commercial operation. Sanmen 2 and Haiyang 2 are currently synced to the grid, with commercial operation expected by year-end. It is important to note that the start-up process for the four units in China has gone and continues to go exceedingly well. Lessons learned from China will continue to benefit our project. Next, as an update to our ongoing initiatives to optimize sources of common equity, we have reached a definitive agreement to sell Southern Power's Mankato Energy Center to Northern States Power. Recall that the Mankato facility consists of an existing one-on-one natural gas combined cycle with an expansion project that is currently in the late stages of construction and is expected to be in service by mid-2019. The expanded two-on-one facility will have a total capacity of approximately 760 megawatts. Subject to customary closing conditions, we expect this transaction to close in mid-2019, be earnings accretive, and offset approximately $400 million of equity needs for Southern Company. The total transaction value is $650 million. I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a financial and economic overview and an update on our existing initiatives. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The Mankato transaction Tom mentioned is another great example of our ability to efficiently source capital to mitigate our broader equity needs. We are also pleased to announce, consistent with previous investor communications, that we've executed the third-party tax equity financing arrangement for substantially all of Southern Power's existing wind portfolio. This transaction, which we expect to close before year-end 2018, provides $1.2 billion of total proceeds, while retaining our important ownership position in a premium carbon-free wind portfolio. The transaction is expected to be EPS accretive and would offset approximately $1 billion of equity needs for Southern Company. We also continued to work through the regulatory approval process at FERC for the sale of Gulf Power and Southern Power's plants Stanton and Oleander. While Gulf Power's most recent priority has been the restoration efforts in the wake of Hurricane Michael, we currently expect to close both transactions during the first quarter of 2019. As a reminder, our initial forecast of post-tax reform equity needs for 2018 through 2022 was approximately $7 billion. We have successfully reduced our projected equity need for this period by more than $4 billion through our proactive efforts to optimize equity sources. Additionally, we have already issued approximately $1 billion of equity through our internal and at-the-market programs through October of this year. Net of the incremental equity for Vogtle that we announced last quarter, our projected remaining equity needs from now through the end of 2022 are only $2.4 billion. We will continue to be thoughtful and strategic as we fulfill these needs. Now, for an update on third quarter earnings results. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we've reported earnings for the third quarter of 2018 of $1.14 per share, compared with earnings of $1.07 per share for the third quarter of 2017. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we reported earnings of $1.92 per share, compared with earnings of $0.35 a share for the same period in 2017. Excluding the charges associated with construction projects, wholesale services earnings and the other items described in our earnings call material, earnings for the third quarter of 2018 and the nine-month period-ending September 2018 were $1.14 and $2.83 per share, respectively. These results compare with adjusted earnings of $1.12 and $2.51 per share for the same periods in 2017. We note the excluded items in our earnings call materials, which include acquisition, disposition and integration impacts as well. Major earnings drivers for our adjusted results for the third quarter and year-to-date 2018 include the positive effects of constructive regulatory outcomes and weather at our state-regulated utilities, somewhat offset by increased depreciation and amortization and interest expense. We have also been successful in holding our O&M expense flat year-over-year at our state-regulated utilities as we continue to work each day to operate more efficiently. Our generation system load was 4% higher in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to warmer-than-normal temperatures in September and despite the impacts of Hurricane Irma \u2013 or including the impacts of Hurricane Irma in September of 2017. The third quarter of 2018 also represented a record high for gas generation and the lowest level of coal generation in more than 15 years. Year-to-date 2018, gas generation represented 48% of the generating mix with a high of 52% in September of 2018. This represents the highest monthly level of natural gas generation in our history. At recent gas price levels, our natural gas units are displacing virtually all of our coal units in the dispatch curve. Moving now to the economic review of the third quarter. The Southeast economy continues to expand at an attractive pace. Our combined business territory continues to see slightly faster population growth than the nation, boosted by a net in migration particularly in Georgia. Job growth in Southern Company's electric business territory of 1.8% is also outpacing the national average. The key driver of our sales growth in this quarter is our strong residential customer growth for both electric and gas, at a rate of 1% with Georgia leading the way. Manufacturing activity in the Southeast electric footprint remained solid and most of our large industrial customers continued to report increases in new orders and production. Absent maintenance-related outages at some paper production manufacturing, which utilize on-site co-generation, we saw positive trends in momentum in industrial consumption broadly across the top 10 industrial categories that we follow, which includes segments like chemicals and primary metals. The economic development pipeline in Southern Company's business territory remains robust despite a modest decline in the total number of active projects. So far this year, we've seen a decline in the number of jobs announced down 8% versus this time last year, but a very solid increase in business investment which is up 29% compared with last year and in line with national trends. Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I want to provide our outlook for the remainder of 2018. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter, which would result in full-year performance at the very top of our revised adjusted EPS guidance range. Remember, we increased our guidance on the second quarter call to $2.95 to $3.05 per share. Our original adjusted EPS guidance range for 2018 was $2.80 to $2.95 per share. Our current year-end guidance implies an adjusted result that is 6% above the midpoint of our original guidance range, driven primarily by cost control, weather and constructive regulatory outcomes in our state-regulated businesses. Our projected long-term EPS growth trajectory of 4% to 6% remains unchanged. This growth trajectory is based off the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance range of $2.87 per share. Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thanks, Drew. As you can see from today's results, we continue to execute across our businesses and we're well-positioned to deliver on our goals for 2018 and beyond. We demonstrated the constructive nature of our state regulatory environments earlier this year as we delivered significant benefits to customers resulting from tax reform, while at the same time maintaining the credit metrics of our state-regulated businesses. For the incremental equity required to meet these plans, we executed in an outstanding manner through earnings accretive asset sales. Additionally, the economy within our service territories remains strong with in-migration and employment driving customer growth. As always, it is our customer-focused business model with emphasis on outstanding reliability, best-in-class customer service, and rates well below the national average that remains the cornerstone of our company and a key driver of long-term value to Southern Company's shareholders. Our commitment to delivering energy and energy solutions to customers includes conserving and protecting the environment for today and for future generations. This progress is evidenced by our successful reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by over 35% since 2007. We understand the importance of engaging with all of our stakeholders in a productive, transparent conversation about how we safely manage risk while delivering shareholder value and growth. Our goal of low- to no-carbon future will continue to inform our planning processes in the near future. We also continue to seek ways to improve our interim benchmarks as we progress towards our objective of a low- to no-carbon future. Southern Power also continues to execute on its plan to deploy capital into value-accretive, carbon-free renewable projects. The 150-megawatt Cactus Flats wind facility in Texas reached commercial operation in July of 2018. The output from this facility is fully contracted through long term purchase power agreements with General Mills and General Motors. Additionally, Southern Power recently announced a 200-megawatt Reading wind facility in Kansas with a 12-year power purchase agreement with Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. Let's now move on to the mid-term elections. We watched last night's election results with much interest. No matter who is in office, we share a strong sense of purpose to our shared constituents all over the United States by providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers we're privileged to serve. We provide an unassailable advantage in a globally competitive worldwide economy. We remain focused on demonstrating superior performance across all our businesses. As we look ahead to our fourth quarter call in February, in addition to sharing our 2019 annual EPS guidance and an update on Vogtle 3 and 4, we will also update our five-year capital forecast, including expected ash pond closure costs and capital initiatives at our state-regulated utilities to improve service and lower operating costs. We certainly appreciate your continued interest in Southern Company and are now ready to take your questions. Operator? We'll now take the first question. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey. Good morning. How are you? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Super. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So is it right that Chuck Eaton and Tricia Pridemore won the election last night? I'm looking online, and it says they were ahead. But I didn't see that there were any firm figures in yet. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, there's still some ballots to be counted. In order to avoid a run-off, they got to be above 50%. Right now, I believe Tricia Pridemore is above 50%. Chuck Eaton, I think the latest tally has him very slightly below 50% but still with absentee ballots uncounted. We'll just have to see how that turns out. If there is a run-off, it would be I think December 4. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you. My second question is on a completely different subject, on Vogtle. Based on the current construction schedule, when does the construction spending and intensity of labor demand at the site actually peak in terms of time horizon? And you starting to see declining spending and declining levels of employment at the site, like when are we at peak construction? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I want to say we're adding about 100 people per month through what, February? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Right. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And then it lasts about a year. There's kind of a big plateau up there, and then it will ramp down starting in February of 2020. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Perfect. Don't have any questions on the quarter. Solid numbers. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you, my friend. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Jonathan. Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Just picking up on what you just said to Greg and looking back at what you'd said last quarter. I think you said your schedule was to hit peak labor in November. So is that target now a little more like spring of next year? And if that is a shift, can you just explain how that fits within the broader Vogtle schedule discussion? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, number of factors at play and one of the first things you should recognize is that the optimal staffing curve is always a little bit of a moving target. Witness the productivity increase that we got on-site, moving from pre-stand-down 80,000 hours a week. We've actually achieved 120,000 hours achieved the last week with actually fewer personnel. So, we're able to manage how much increased staffing we'll need by what our productivity assumption may be. Further, there's a whole host of other things at play. I think we mentioned this Helping Hands idea. A lot of what's going on right now involves setting up cable trays and pulling cable on-site. Ultimately, you have to connect that cable. One of the things we thought about is the original projections assume that electricians would handle most of that work. Through the Helping Hands initiative, we can re-segment the work so that other craft labor can participate in that activity. That obviously has an impact on how many electricians you will need. Ultimately, we do need more electricians on-site, and we have aggressive plans in place. We continue to work with Department of Labor. We continue to think about different ways to reduce absenteeism and attract new labor from around the region. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So can you give some specifics on how many new people you need, versus what you've done so far? Or just some numbers around that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Sure. I think, since \u2013 if I remember this right, we had probably, May through June, 4,100 direct craft. Post the reset, we actually reduced the number of craft on-site. That went down to about 3,700, right? And we've been adding some people now here lately. I think last week, we added 40 people. Right now, we have 3,850 on-site, and what we would like to do by February to March is have somewhere in the 4,500 region. So, if you add 100 per craft, that gets you to that kind of number. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, you need (27:22) up from where you are today as the rough number? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Yeah, and like I said, there's going to be a little bit of a moving target there, but that's right. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just from memory, that's probably a similar deficit to what you were talking about last quarter. So, is that number very similar? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I would bet it's a wee bit less, but yeah, it's similar. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. I wouldn't quibble about that. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And just final other thing. There was a number earlier in the year. I think it may have been the independent monitor's number that you needed to \u2013 at some point you need to get to 140,000 hours a week. And it's obviously good to see you getting within shot of that. But is that a number that was \u2013 is that your number? Or was that more staff number? And you got the right target? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, you've got great memory. Yeah, yeah, you've got a great memory. So let's just kind of go through the numbers. So if we hit 120,000, kind of, a duration, we believe we'll be able to satisfy the schedule at November. Of course, we'll use up a lot of our scheduled contingency, essentially getting above 120,000 to 140,000, or if we could do it even better than 140,000 to 150,000 or even 160,000. What that does is increase our schedule margin and that's something we're pursuing with great haste, but those numbers you're remembering are correct. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah, just to emphasize. The 140,000 was related to the accelerated schedule, which would put us in service and preserve margin, but it's the April timeframe as opposed to the November commitment that we've made statewide. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Right. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And from what I'm hearing, that's probably the type of number we should focus on perhaps more than in our head count for example. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, that's exactly right. So, here is the thing. We're very gratified with the improvement in productivity that allowed us with fewer people to increase our hours up to 120,000. I must say, and we push our people around a lot in our meetings, it's \u2013 I think the ability with that level of staffing to get more productivity starts to get a little limited. Our key to success in getting more margin now will be getting more people. You're right to focus on the numbers of hours, because that's ultimately what matters. Getting work done on the site. We do think we need more people on-site now. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: More people but in absolute terms, I don't know that we include that as part of our three-cornered hat. We do still believe that CPI and SPI, which measure the productivity and the cost of that labor being produced probably are better measures for us in aggregate. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's right because all that matters is hours worked, right. I'm just saying at these productivity levels. At these productivity levels, we need more people. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for all the extra color there, guys. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Steve. How are you? Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, hi. Good morning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good morning. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Tom. Good. Thanks. So just one question just on the guidance. So, if you basically just take the $2.87 base that you've mentioned and grow it to 4% to 6%, in 2019 you'd be back to essentially what you're earning in 2018 at the high end. So is that mainly explained that the 2018 upside has mainly been the favorable weather? Or how should I think about that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, Steve. I'd say that partially. So, if we compare weather, it's about $0.08 improvement relative to what our normal expectation would be, but I think the balance of your math is correct. A good portion of our benefit is still coming from productive state regulatory reform and usage and customer growth. And recall, when we went out with that original guidance, a lot of that was on the basis of 7 million shares associated with preserving the credit metrics with tax reform. What we've been able to do through these asset sales is essentially avoid now over 4 million shares, so the shares avoided certainly has a pickup in 2018 relative to what our original estimate was. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Steve, I'd say this do your math more directly, to answer your question more directly. If we take the $3.05 and back out about $0.08, we're still significantly above the top end of our initial guidance range just because of the factors we talked about. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And I want to add, we've done a really good job keeping O&M flat. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: That's right. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So, just the obvious question then is why does that not imply better than 4% to 6% after that? Or why are you going back to the same base of $2.87 for your growth rate? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So recall, you got the regulatory structure at Georgia. So, as we go through 2019 and 2020 moving to in-service of 2021, we have effects there through the earnings rates, which you've always kind of talked about that it would kind of be flattish a little bit, but within our 4% to 6% growth off of $2.87. The other thing we have is when we think about the effects of selling Gulf Power or Florida City Gas or Elizabethtown or Mankato, we have a net effect we had originally planned for taking some of the 7 million shares in the form of something like converts, where we kind of plan that in 2019. We may do that similar thing, but it's less of an effect in 2019. All the positive accretion we see from those deals will likely start to show in 2020 and 2021. I think we're going to see the lion's share of the accretion in those two-years particularly. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Plus, a little bit of added retention for credit quality... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: ...related to a couple of branches. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay that all makes sense. Just a couple other quick ones. On Mankato, I recall you bought that for like $400 million and then you've had to finish the expansion, so what's the $650 million relative to your investment? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: So a couple hundred million dollars invested in the expansion of Mankato, the total invested today is about $580 million. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And when you're \u2013 it's fully done, is it going to be about that $650 million or...? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: The $580 million. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : About $580 million fully done, okay. And then just one other question in terms of the kind of investor friendly actions like Mankato. What's the sense that maybe there might be more of those to do over time or over let's say the coming year or have you kind of exhausted them you think? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Oh, yeah, no, no, there's plenty of opportunities to do more. We try to be very judicious and strategic in how we exercise those things, but there's certainly more on the palette of opportunities. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Good. Thanks. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Michael. Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Actually this is Khanh for Michael. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Okay. Great. Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking our question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So just following on Steve's question there. You say there's a lot more opportunities there, but is there a level of earnings contribution from Southern Power that you target or that you'd be comfortable with going forward, given all the sale of Gulf Power? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Say it again I'm sorry, your question? Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): The level of earnings contribution from Southern Power to the overall EPS? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Southern. Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, sure. Variety of things here. We have been in the low 300s for some time at Southern Power. As we think about the different \u2013 we've remixed so a lot of that earnings in the past, I don't know, two to three years was ITC related from solar, and so you've got these big pops. We've intentionally, and I think, we have some information in our slide material, transitioned from the kind of single year, people are shaking their heads at me on that on the slide material, but we've transitioned away from kind of the one-time pops to more the 10-year production tax credit, associated with wind. So here is kind of where we think Southern Power ends up, and that is earnings in kind of the low-200s, growing at 5% to 10% and we really think also that's a function of the market. When we saw tax reform occur, and we started hinting at this some last year, we really refocused growing a lot of earnings outside the state-regulated utility franchises, both electric and gas. And right now, what we see is when you think about Southern's earnings, something like 95% of Southern's earnings come from our state-regulated electric and gas franchises. That's where we think the best opportunity to grow the business is and we think it's a very attractive risk return proposition. Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, that's great, thank you. Also, I'll follow up on a smaller topic, PowerSecure. At this point, do you have any thoughts or comments on Bloom's ability to execute on their projects and permits? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We're going to execute to \u2013 I'm going to comment on Bloom broadly. I'll say this. We've had a terrific relationship with Bloom and where we have deployed the Bloom technology along with our own proprietary storage and switch gear, we've had a terrific experience and the customers love it. More broadly, about PowerSecure. I think, I haven't seen the final numbers on Michael, but for Irma and a variety of these other storms, PowerSecure customers have been able to maintain operability during these worst of times at like a 98% availability level. It's been a terrific business and you know what I say frequently on the stump is, Southern has been such an iconic company for so long and we have such great franchises and such a great customer base. It is, however, I think this kind of inexorable change where, because technology enables it and because customers are requiring it, I think this old 100-year-old model of make, move and sell at a central station asset concentrated level may in fact start to dissipate over time. And that's why we did the acquisition of PowerSecure. And I think what also is notable, if you look at the recent business of Southern Power, we grew up on selling to IOUs and munis and co-ops, and lately we've been selling long term renewables to people like General Mills, General Motors and Carnival Cruise Lines. So what we're seeing is an intersection of interest particularly in the commercial and industrial sectors between what Southern Power is now doing and what PowerSecure is doing. Add to that our fuel management capabilities at places like Sequent, we think that we not only can play well but in fact influence how distributed infrastructure may occur in America. So it's very exciting. It's a very small bet. We've always said that, but it's a very exciting option bet that we've made. Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's great. Thank you so much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well done thus far. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: How about that? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, I wanted to follow-up \u2013 yeah, absolutely. Well, so I wanted to follow-up a little bit on Southern Power just to clarify couple things. What's the implied PE multiple on the latest sale? And then how do you think about, again, like the accretive equity? I mean, just to come back a little bit to Steve's question, how much could you cumulatively if you think about eligible assets kind of displaced of that remaining equity need if you think about what's on the table here? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: So, Julien, this is Drew. I would start by saying there's not really a good multiple that I could describe to you because it's not a plant in-service, and so you're probably better triangulating it off of something like dollars per kilowatt. And we think it's a very fair market transaction and something that would be good for Northern States Power. You second part, second part of your question was really what else resides in the portfolio, and I think we've got to take a look at each of the individual assets one by one, assess their importance to the Southern portfolio, to our business partners that are the municipal and cooperative load aggregators within the State. And we'll just continue to look at them one by one. We have the \u2013 I think, we've shown a strong preference for participating in the construction of wind and solar assets. We want to continue to do that. We've probably optimized from a tax perspective against those two asset classes, and that's why you see movement now on something like Mankato, which is out of the gas portfolio. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, we try to be very kind of dogmatic about M&A. I know I've been answering M&A questions since even when I was CFO, but we try to have as much discipline about buying as we do selling. And a lot of times when you think about M&A in the asset space, as Drew mentioned, it's who is the best owner? Who can think about deriving synergies to improve their bottom-line? Or who can blend that operation into their business to reduce risk? Those are kind of the ways we create value here. We think there's plenty more opportunities, and we'll see how they turn out. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Just a little follow-on. If I thought more about the Wind portfolio, I think the current tax equity transaction represents sort of eight of the facilities within the portfolio, and we will have continued construction and some other assets that would qualify under very similar construct. And so those will also be avenues for us for capital raise without disposition of assets. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell of KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Anthony. Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: How are you doing, Tom? Good morning. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Awesome. Great. Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hopefully two easy questions. One is just a housekeeping item. The $0.10 you took for tax reform in this quarter \u2013 is that a timing issue that backs out the fourth quarter? Or we shouldn't see a reversal of that? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No. You won't see a reversal. That's an ongoing matter. And remember just broadly, too, I think, when we saw tax reform \u2013 essentially I got that question also on \u2013 or I guess, I created the question on CNBC this morning. It showed that our revenues missed. Even though our bottom line was way up, our revenues were off by 0.7%. We think that's a function of tax reform. In other words, what we did was reduced rates, and about the rough math was about two thirds of the benefit went into rate reductions. One third of the benefit was captured to support higher equity ratios, which in fact, preserved our credit quality, our debt coverage ratios. So if I had to, kind of, think about it, it's an ongoing benefit of two thirds of any dollar of tax reform benefit go to customers. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I think in this particular circumstance there, it's $0.10, but that nets from $0.22 worth of benefits. And so it is something \u2013 that is the functioning of how it will be forever. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Oh, great. And then you said there would be more of a primer on the two indexes you're using for Vogtle on slide 31. So, when you talk about an SPI of 1.02, does that mean you're getting 2% more hours done than what you planned? I'm just trying to understand how should I look at SPI and CPI. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, that's wonderful stuff. So in general, what you should look for on schedule, the SPI is essentially one equals April, and \u2013 what did I say \u2013 1.2 or so equals November, somewhere around there. Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So does that mean that you're ahead of schedule? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It means, I think, we're on pace for our April aggressive schedule. Now, the real key to that, Anthony, is thinking about how we're able to keep pace on staffing at the site. Let me just review that again. At about the 120,000 level, 120,000 hours per week, what we are able to do, we think, is hit the November schedule, okay? But we would do that without margin. So what we're trying to do is increase hours worked per week above 120,000, and I think it was Jonathan that remembered the 140,000. We could go 150,000, 160,000, but anything we do above that level increases our margin and enables us to better hit a more accelerated schedule, which right now we're planning for April, not November. Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And that accelerated schedule we should see the SPI rise to like 1.05? Is that a fair understanding of it? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, sir. If we are not able to keep pace on getting staffing up to 140,000 by, I don't know, February, something like that, then we'll have less margin. The 1.0 would be April, so maybe instead of April, you would end up with May or June or something like that. A lower number on SPI is better, okay? And the whole staffing and the whole hours worked per week is all an objective to increase margin against the regulatory schedule of November. Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, Tom. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet, buddy. See you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont of Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. Good morning. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question relates to Mankato. I'm still trying to understand the difference between the cash that you're getting through the door and the reduction in your equity need. Why wouldn't the reduction in your equity need be at least the $580 million which is your cost basis in the plant? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: So if you remember, it's a capital-based asset we acquired a couple of years ago. There is some depreciation associated with that asset, and so the deltas really just reflects what the current tax basis is. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Okay. So the difference between the $650 million and the $400 million is all tax-driven? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: That and we also rebalance our capital structure so that we meet our FFO-to-debt targets. And so a portion of the proceeds will be used to pay down debt. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Okay. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: We try to couch all of our sales based on the equity reduction, knowing that the proceeds will be used for both purposes; repayment of debt and reduction of equity need. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And recall the whole $7 billion that we've been targeting is really at a thicker equity ratio for the company, in general, which gets us back to the coverage ratios at the Southern level. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Right. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Okay. So, it also relates to your attempting to hit some target of FFO to debt, which I assume is in the 15% range? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: That's correct. 16%. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : And then how much \u2013 what was the weather year-to-date relative to normal? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: About $0.08 in total. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Okay. And then at Southern Power, in order to grow the 5% to 10%, how much of that sort of \u2013 I think, you've identified up to $500 million of incremental investment that's not in your CapEx numbers. How much of that do you need to do, or is all of the growth coming from tax equity transactions which are not affecting your cash outlays? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, let's review the bidding there. Kind of in the prior numbers we gave you was $1.5 billion a year, is what we were looking at, and we've ratcheted that back to about $500 million a year. When you look at the two ranges we just gave you growing at 5% and growing at 10%, the $500 million a year will get us to the 10% number, no incremental growth gets us at a long term 5% earnings float. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : So, that's no incremental capital gets you to the 5%? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Right. That's it. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : And does that incorporate some assumption of transactions that you're doing on a tax-equity basis or not? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It assumes what we've announced, in other words the solar, the wind, but nothing further. We'll evaluate tax equity going forward. We're eating pretty dramatically into any kind of carry-forward position we have, and so we'll assess going forward whether we want to do tax equity or just carry the production tax credits ourselves. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : And then last question from me. You indicated that you're done with respect to equity for the year, so can we use the ending share count at the end of the third quarter as the ending share count for the year? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: No, I don't think that's probably fair. We have drip and dribble that still continue through balance of year. The ATM is the one that we may modulate based on our expectations, but \u2013 and our success really in raising capital in these methods, but we still have to preserve all the options we've got through the balance of the year. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, and it's really not just the balance of the year, it's everything. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Because we'll look at other investor-friendly options, et cetera. So, we'll balance all that together. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Ali. Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Good morning. Tom and Drew, just wanted to clarify a few points. One on Mankato, just to be clear. When the plant is fully running with the expansion complete, et cetera, what's the annual net income that would go away now that otherwise would have been flowing through the Southern numbers? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Ali, I just have to get back to you on it. I don't recall what the projection was. I should probably know it, but don't. Something we can talk to you about in the post-call. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. But to be clear, when you all talk about Southern Power's base of low-200 number, that includes both the tax equity transaction, as well as Mankato? Or is that requiring further adjustments? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, it includes all of those effects. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Ali, the only thing I'd say is the Mankato sale is generally accretive to us. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes. It's about $0.01. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: About a $0.01, so that's the other way to triangulate an answer to the first question you asked. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then secondly, if I recall correctly, you folks have been budgeting your outlook overall at a flattish sort of load growth profile. And as you've been pointing out, you're running at about 1%. Does that change your outlook? And if I recall, 1% pickup all else being equal is about an incremental $0.06 of annual earnings. Is that a fair way to think about this? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I don't know whether you saw my little appearance on TV this morning. Look, the numbers we're showing this quarter are really at the tops of what we've been talking about for some years now, 1.4% growth quarter-over-quarter in retail sales, 2.4% in industrial, 1% growth in customers. Look these are all really good numbers. I would just throw a wee bit of caution on all that optimism. With my work at the Fed and everything else in our own analysis we do look at something that I call momentum numbers and I'm seeing momentum that looks kind of flat. That is you still may be positive quarter-over-quarter, but if you're less positive, I call that a negative. The momentum numbers would indicate that there is a bit of a pause in the economy and absent any positive action, we could see those numbers go back down a bit. What could unleash it? I think what we're seeing in the good numbers is the effect of tax reform and lower regulation and so people are investing in their businesses but they're doing it largely in their current sites, or expanding a current site. I think there is another wave but that wave is being suppressed right now through kind of long-term concern about the tax war, skirmish, whatever phrase you want to use. If we could resolve some of that uncertainty in the worldwide economic market, I think there is another breath to take on continued economic expansion, which would really help those numbers. That's kind of what I'm seeing right now. But boy if you look at our manufacturing numbers, for example, Drew, virtually all of them are positive. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Certainly, on the industrial side too, strong segments across all 10 segments. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And because our job growth is great, unemployment rate is still low, people will come to the Southeast to get jobs and we'll continue to deliver jobs to the public. It's a really good dynamic right now. I just want to throw just a little bit of caution on it. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. And then one last one. If I recall correctly from your prior equity plans, I believe the goal was to raise about $1.4 billion of equity in 2018. I know you've done about a billion through October. Is that still the target we should be assuming, $1.4 billion for the year? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: It really does move through time and the goal is through 2022. I think we've done some very proactive things now with the sale of Mankato and being able to get $1 billion worth of equity up. We will, I want to be able to preserve our options through the balance of the year. The dividend reinvestment plan will still be functioning and the ATM is still open, but I don't know if I'm answering your question directly. I think we will continue to issue shares at least in some form through the balance of the year. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: But we're on hold on the ATM. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. Just to clarify, Drew, your annual capacity to generate equity through the internal programs is how much and how much has been done through the nine-months? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: $500 million or $600 million per annum through all programs really, options and dividend reinvestment. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. And how much have we done so far? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: This year? Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Three-quarters of that amount. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I've got you. Thank you very much. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: It's a pretty straight line for those two programs. The only options really are variable, we can't control the exercise of but dividend reinvestment really is the principal one and so the next \u2013 that happens as dividends are declared and paid. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you so much. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning, guys. You covered just about everything. I guess maybe just one last one I want to ask about the O&Ms. I believe you said you've been happy with what you've been doing year-to-date and that's been driving the upside to this year's numbers. My question is how do you think about the cost savings you've seen as being structural and recurring in the future years versus sort of one-time savings that might not repeat in 2019 and beyond? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: No, these are structural. Look, we've been working on something called modernization here, and the whole idea is we're making investments in our business largely technology driven, I would say, otherwise, kind of environmental driven, the ash pond work, a variety of other things. And what we're able to do is, for example, through technology provide customers with like a four times greater point of presence, while reducing the fixed assets in the field through investments in local towns and a variety of other things. So we've actually been able to improve customer service and create structural reductions in O&M. Georgia Power clearly has been a leader in that, and we think those things are sustainable around the clock here at Southern. And there's more to go, so we'll keep working on it. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: It's probably fair to say that the results will vary by franchise, and we're in different states of maturity in each. But the goal really is to grind inflation ultimately out of the business in aggregate and see if we can't do more of that from the parent. And then, really it's an offset to a lot of the capital that needs to be invested into rate-base into the franchises. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And some of that sounds kind of ominous, but if you look at Georgia Power by reducing, kind of, capital in the field and investing in technology and this multiplication of points of presence, they were actually voted the Most Trusted Electric Utility in the United States last year. We can improve customer service and, at the same time, take cost out of the business. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Just to clarify on that, you talked on the last call about finding income-generating CapEx opportunities. Should we think of these as being a net increase or decrease to CapEx? And I know we'll get more details in the next call, but directionally, how does that net out? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It's an increase in CapEx. The objective will be take O&M down, increase CapEx, keeping rates constant, all other things being equal. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Okay. Then lastly, the 4% to 6%, what did that assume for O&M? Over the long term period... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It assumes a regular growth rate of, like 3%, but as Drew said, we're not going to be satisfied with growing O&M at 3%. We're going to grind it away to zero is what we're hoping for. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Good morning, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, Tom. Thank you for taking my question today. Real quick, when you look at your generation fleet across the different subsidiaries, where do you think the greatest opportunity is for fleet transformation, meaning the potential for incremental coal retirements, the potential for significant growth in either solar or gas-fired generation, or a combination of both? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, sure. We're selling our \u2013 I think it's our most heavy coal generator is Gulf Power. NextEra is buying them. We have been \u2013 Georgia Power has been a leader in the United States. In fact, remember they were voted the number one Investor Owned Utility by the solar industry. They have the largest voluntary solar program in the United States. My sense is solar will continue to be in favor in the portfolio. With Georgia and even Alabama, we now see wind, we see some solar, and we continue to rethink opportunities in gas. So Mississippi is really pretty small. So when you think about our whole portfolio now, what you see is a growing trend as we complete Vogtle, maintaining nuclear, growing gas with the influence of coal over time dissipating. That's the trend you should see. Much more renewables. Before I got here, we were zero on renewables. Now, across our fleet, including Southern Power, we're around 10%. That's \u2013 for a company that produces as much energy as the nation of Australia roundabouts, that's a pretty big move. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Praful, how are you? Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you so much. Hi, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So, maybe first touch on the way you're measuring EPS accretion as you talk about these different transactions. What is the baseline for that? Is it assuming a baseline with some equity issuances? Or just so I understand, what is the base against which EPS accretion is being measured? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah, that's effectively it. So, we're looking at the projection for net income for the underlying asset, the effects for us on EPS' share, earnings per share. We're really looking at the income relative to the cost of avoiding issuance of new equity. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, so, you lose net income, but you don't have the shares. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Don't have shares. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And if the sales price is beneficial, you get accretion. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: The simplest form of this is sort of the after-tax proceeds on a per-share basis relative to our own share price, although that varies with tax position and basis in the underlying asset but that's the calculation. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I got you. So, some assumption that went into what price at which you'd issue the equity kind of drives a little bit of the analysis as well? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: It does. It does. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. All right. And then maybe just want to touch on one of the points you made earlier, which was on the tax equity side. The point you made was I think you want to hold off to doing too much more tax equity. I didn't really understand the reason why if you could just clarify why. Is there any kind of constraint on doing more tax equity or not? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Oh, no. No constraint at all. The issue is we just look on a case-by-case basis. When you think about the Florida transaction we just did, we had an enormous kind of carry-forward position. That's a taxable transaction. That takes away \u2013 all these asset sales that are taxable, eats away at that carry-forward position. We're now in a position where we can think kind of on a case-by-case basis whether we want to carry the tax credits and PTCs, ITCs, whatever they are or whether we'd rather sell the tax benefits to somebody else. It's really a pretty straightforward calculation as to the time value with cash, whether we're better having it or whether somebody else is. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: And we've come close to optimization with the current portfolio. What Tom described is absolutely true for future construction. We'll also have assets that mature enough so this becomes a possibility even within the existing portfolio, but we will look at it against share issuance at every point. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Understood. And so where does your current cash tax position stand? As in when do you expect to be cash taxpayers again given all these earning gains that you've had through these asset sales? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So, yeah, the numbers move over time but kind of 2023-2024. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Understood. Thank you. And then finally, just quickly on Vogtle, the labor need that you're saying you're hoping to grow above the 120,000, is there a particular market like the Canadian market in terms of what you're looking to tap to get more workers? Or how should we think about where those additional workers come from at this point? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We have been working with the Department of Labor to source labor from Canada. Yes, we have. But there are other ways to get that labor, too. And remember, this Helping Hands thing is a new strategy. I don't know. How long is it? Probably four-to-six-months old, something like that, but it's a way to re-segment the work so that we need fewer electricians and we can let other craft labor take big segments of work like pulling cable through cable trays. Ultimately, you have to connect the cable, so you need electricians. Plus, other ideas we have about sourcing through reducing attrition on the site, reducing absenteeism on the site and increasing productivity. We're very thoughtful of that a variety of ways. Even if we don't get labor from Canada, we may be able to source enough personnel to accomplish the work we need and get the margins we want. One other big factor we haven't spent a lot of time on; we continually work on the site with lessons learned from China and working with our prime contractor Bechtel to re-sequence work, optimize work processes and we've achieved much-better productivity that witnessed the latest numbers as a result of those good efforts. I personally call or we speak, Brendan Bechtel and I, once every two weeks or so. Steve Kuczynski, Head of our Nuclear Group is on-site all the time. We are working with the executives at Bechtel and Southern Nuclear to always optimize the workflow and we've been able to improve productivity as a result of that. That also goes to the need and timing of new personnel on-site, that's something else I alluded to but wasn't as direct as I am now. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's super helpful. Thanks so much, guys. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Paul. How are you? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : How is it going? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Terrific. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just to sort of \u2013 almost everything has been asked and answered, but just back to the Helping Hands, is there sort of any limitation? This sort of sounds like sort of a \u2013 sounds like it opens up all sorts of opportunity. I mean, is there any limit I guess in terms of how much that could be employed or how should we think about that? It just seems like... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, sure there are limits. The kind of obvious limit I just said was ultimately we'll need electricians to connect the cables. We think kind of right now, we've displaced 150 people through this Helping Hands thing, but I think you're right. I think \u2013 but here again, let me give kudos to the labor unions here. We've always had a great relationship with folks like Sean McGarvey and others. It's a real partnership on-site between management, Bechtel and the unions, everybody wants this site to be successful and the unions have been super cooperative, and creative and thoughtful in how we deploy personnel here and get them to work together. They've really been terrific. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, I guess, just to sort of, there were a lot of numbers in terms of productivity et cetera and how things have sort of changed and you spoke to Jonathan Arnold and Greg about this. So just sort of want to \u2013 just to make things clear, you guys are still very confident and you feel that you're on track to meet those productivity numbers \u2013 they're just going to be \u2013 the productivity levels, is this going to be a little bit later than you thought it was going to be, is that how we should think about it? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah, we've been 110,000. We just got 120,000. In order to get \u2013 and we think kind of at the 120,000 level we can hit November, and now we'll use up all our margin. So the objective right now, based on this kind of ambitious schedule that we've laid out, is to do the best we can to improve margin, to get back to kind of an April in-service. In order to do that, we need to continuously evaluate, continuously monitor, but otherwise get new people to the site and get the hours worked per-week up. That is how we improve margin. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And do you feel that you're going to \u2013 that's very achievable, right? I just want to make sure I understand how confident you guys are in being able to do that. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: We certainly are confident of our ability to attract more people to the site and therefore improve margin. We certainly are confident and this remains unchanged, of our ability to hit November. What we're about now is improving the margin to November and recall the on-site schedule is one where we're aiming at April. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. I got it. I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige of Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed. Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research): Hey, guys. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Hello. Kit, I hope you're well. Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research): Yeah, everything's good. How about you? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: It's fantastic. Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research): All right. I wanted in a little bit different arena to ask about the sales number. So year-to-date, you're showing positive weather adjusted sales, looks like pretty well spread across most of the customer classes. Can you give us some color on how confident you are that that's a realistic ongoing sales growth number and does it have more to do with customer usage or increase in customers? Just any sense of how much that can be projected into the future? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: So I think all good questions related to sales. Our retail sales growth year-to-date weather normalized is up about 1.1%. That's pretty broad based. If you look at residential, it's 0.8%, commercial is about 0.6% and industrial is up almost 2% year-to-date. If I look at weather in the year, about $0.05 of benefit occurred in the first half and about $0.03 of it occurred in this last quarter, it certainly was a very strong third quarter for generation. Customer usage is generally flat. That's maybe a little bit better than what we had initially anticipated. Efficiency will be a persistent trend and one that we certainly aren't here to buck, the efficiency of underlying equipment has improved materially from its original placement. And so we really will rely on in-migration into our state's good manufacturing and good industrial demand, and I think retail will plug right along but will be partially offset certainly by efficiency. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, Drew. The other thing that we always kind of laugh at each other in the group I think is weather-adjusted number. So, we really do work hard at getting good numbers, but I'm always a little skeptical as to the weather adjustment. For example, in 2017, we had a hurricane, so we had to adjust out the effect of a hurricane year-over-year. Next year, we've had Hurricane Michael in the fourth quarter. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: We're going to have to adjust all that out. These adjustments, we do the best we can. I'm always a little squeamish about them. Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research): Fair enough. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Yeah, I would say our margin of error in the net is probably in the tenths of a percent. We had a very abnormal January that was kind of outside of the normal distribution, we had one of the warmest Septembers, and we're really not making any hurricane adjustment. We still had really good consumption despite having a number of customers off. It was benefited by the fact that it was just a very short period of time and had excellent reconstruction effort throughout Florida and Georgia. Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research): That's great. Very helpful insight. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hello, Charles. Good morning. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning. Hey. Just on China. It sounds like you still have people there. I wonder, Tom, if you could say roughly how many. There's still one or two plants under construction, you've got people there, you've got people at the two operating plants. How long are you going to keep them there? If you could just \u2013 no details, just if you can provide a little more color? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yeah, we've had about a couple dozen people over there. They're now starting to matriculate back to the U.S., so we're not going to have permanent staffing there. We've really been there during the construction. So, now that these guys are going in-service, there's really no need to have them there. We continue to have a good exchange with the Chinese about the plants, and the NRC frankly has been very constructive in thinking about how those plants have operated and started up much better than what people expected. We have kept our own estimates on start-up constant, but we're very gratified with the experience the Chinese have had. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. That's all I had. Thanks, Tom. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan of Verition Fund Management. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Ashar, how are you? Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC : Pretty good, Tom. Thanks. Can I just ask where are we with our equity ratios or expect to be by the end of the year versus what is authorized? And my second follow-up question is how should we use the proceeds? There're going to be like $6.6 billion of proceeds in the first half of 2019 that you're going to accrue from the sales. What would be the use of funds for those proceeds? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: So, on equity ratios I think we are at target in the Georgia franchises, which is right at 55%. We've got a longer ramp into Alabama's capitalization and expect 55% by 2025 there. Your question was around use of proceeds. The entire backlog of equity requirement is there really to meet those equity needs and so we will fund as we generate. Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC : But can I just ask you like the $6.6 billion, right, so can we assume that you don't need equity next year because you'll be getting like $6.6 billion of proceeds coming in in the first six months of 2019? The rest is used for funding and debt reduction or how should I use that $6.6 billion? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Right. So I think we've got a reconciliation of it in the slides that we put out with the call. The total need has been reduced to $2.4 billion. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Over the next five years. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Over the next five years. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And so we could be creative in how we do that, but we'll follow up with... Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC : Well, that's what I was trying to get some color on that, is that do you need to issue equity next year, because you're getting so many proceeds in 2019? Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: Absolutely. So page eight is the best place for you to go. And we can certainly follow up with you and IR, but even though the asset sale in Florida may represent over $6 billion, we are very cognizant of our credit quality and so that comes with an associated paydown of debt that will help us maintain our FFO to debt ratios and our debt to total capitalization. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: So your triangulation there is going to get to a 16% FFO to debt. Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC : Okay. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: And that would imply some level of equity. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: That's right. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Whether we take it there, accelerate it or not we have flexibility to do that. Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC : Okay. Thank you so much. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Carl Seligson of Utility Financial Experts. Please proceed with your question. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Carl Seligson, be still my beating heart. Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts : You're wonderful, Tom. I hope it clears up your cold too, so you don't have to keep reaching for whatever you're reaching for. Tom, are you maintaining a list or either on paper or in your head, or something of people who because of their interest like Northern States interest, might be interested in future transactions and have you got a list of future possible transactions, because you've started being a financial expert, I just wonder where you're going with it? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: I'm sorry, Carl, what was the point of that? Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts : I don't know. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Hey, look... Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts : Is there anything more coming down the line in your head if not actually on paper as far as asset transactions so that you can... Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Of course. The world of M&A covers assets, it covers companies, it covers everything, and we try and have the same discipline whether we're buying or selling. Particularly, I thought we bought very smartly with AGL Resources. And when you think about some of the PE multiples and implied share prices, therefore, of the sales that we've done, we think we've accreted enormously to shareholder value well over, I don't know, $3 billion or $4 billion here. We're always looking over our hand here, whether we're a buyer or a seller, and you're right. I mean we kind of laugh about it, but like my good friend Ben Fowke up there at Xcel, I did pick up the phone and call Ben and just see what his interest was. We have plenty of opportunities whether to use the phone or bump into each other at a variety of meetings that we have. It's a very interesting environment right now. The good news is it's an option laden environment. I think there's a lot of interest and activity both on the buying and selling realm for a variety of people, some of which are conventional, strategic buyers and some of which are the financial buyers, the non-strategics. Anyway, there's a very active evaluation going on in the market right now and we're certainly participating in that. Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.: The best owner is really strong internal concept and Northern States is the off-taker for Mankato. It makes a lot of sense for business simplification for both ourselves and for that company, and I think that's a very good reason why they are the best owner of that asset... Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts : I think that makes a lot of sense, thanks for that add on, and Tom I'm sorry, I'm going to miss you all in San Francisco, but I can't make it this year. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Oh, man, I hate that. It's always good catching up. Hey, I'm so appreciative of you joining us on the call. Really good hearing from you. Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts : Thank you, my friend. Take care. Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.: Well, it's been quite a year. It's been a terrific quarter and I think as we've suggested, we've got a great foundation to continue to sustain this performance. Very gratified with our progress at Vogtle. We continue to work hard. We know there will always be challenges, but we appreciate your attention on today's call and look forward to chatting with you in the next week or so. See you soon. Thanks, everybody. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude The Southern Co.'s third quarter 2018 earnings call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you, and have a great rest of the day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 20, 2019. Your speakers to today are Scott Gammill, Tom Fanning, and Drew Evans I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Daisy. Good morning, and welcome to The Southern Company's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements including those discussed in our Form 10-K, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas Fanning : Good morning and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. As we report our 2018 results and look ahead to 2019 and beyond, our focus remains on investing in our premier state regulated utilities and providing outstanding risk-adjusted returns for investors. 2018 was a year of incredible accomplishments for Southern Company. We entered the year with a great deal of uncertainty regarding corporate tax reform and our own first full year as general contractor at Vogtle 3 and 4. First regarding tax reform, we reached timely innovative and constructive outcomes with regulators in multiple jurisdictions, and as a result are in the process of delivering approximately $1.8 billion of benefits to customers, while preserving our credit quality and improving earnings per share. At Vogtle Units 3 and 4, we completed our first full year as general contractor. In July, we revised the estimated cost to complete and we recalibrated site production expectations with a site-wide reset. Since then, we have achieved a trajectory of staffing and productive hours worked per week that is ahead of what we targeted on our last earnings call. We continue to have a lot of work ahead of us to sustain this performance, but we are pleased with our progress and are confident that we can meet the schedule approved by our regulators. I'll provide more details on Vogtle 3 and 4, shortly. We are executing our business model in a world class manner. Our modernization initiatives have improved customer service and resilience of our system. Through aggressive cost management, we expect to continue to invest in our state regulated franchise, while keeping rates low, sustaining our outstanding operational performance and delivering strong financial performance. In 2018, we successfully completed strategic value accretive transactions totaling over $11 billion, efficiently sourcing equity to strengthen our balance sheet. Notably, we closed on the sale of Gulf Power Company on January 1, 2019, and we expect to close on the sale of Southern Power's Mankato facility this summer. Our decisive actions substantially reduced our projected equity needs, removed significant risk from financing plans and positioned the company for future growth. Customers are at the center of everything we do and we have continued our long-standing track record of providing some of the best customer service in the business. For example, Georgia Power was the highest rated utility for both residential and business customer satisfaction by JD Power in the South region in 2018, and Nicor Gas was rated among the most trusted utility brands by residential customers. Let\u2019s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Throughout 2018, progress at the site was significant. We achieved our major 2018 construction milestones for the project. Overall, including engineering, procurement, and the initial test plan, the project is approximately 74% complete. During the past three months, several significant milestones were achieved. Unit 3 milestones included, setting the first reactor coolant pump, placement of the third and final containment ring, and setting the main control room roof. At Unit 4, we set the pressurizer and second steam generator inside the containment vessel. Additionally, since our third quarter earnings call, the remaining two AP1000 units in China, Sandman 2 and Haiyang 2 achieved commercial operation. Lessons learned from China will continue to benefit our project. On our third quarter call, we detailed solid productivity improvement, and I'm pleased to report today that positive momentum at that site continues. We've successfully added approximately 700 new skilled craft resources, attracting pipe fitters and electricians to the site. We told you in November that we were targeting to ramp up to 140,000 productive hours worked per week by March. So far, for the month of February, we have averaged 141,000 earned hours per week. In fact, last week, we achieved a 146,000 hours with a CPI of 1.08. We are focused on sustaining this progress throughout 2019 and into spring of 2020. As we have discussed previously, we continue to manage construction on a more aggressive schedule in order to preserve margin to the regulatory approved dates. For reference, we currently estimate that we need to sustain approximately 110,000 weekly earned hours in order to meet the November \u201821 and November 2022 regulatory approved schedule. We are currently in the midst of rebaselining our work for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. At a high level, this effort involves a verification of estimates for remaining commodity quantities, hours to install those quantities, staffing trends, testing and system turnover requirements and achievable craft labor production. This rebaselining effort will refine the weekly work plan for the remainder of the project. Our over arching objective in the rebaselining effort is to maintain the aggressive work plan at the site, allowing us to preserve as much margin in our schedule as possible to the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in service dates. While it's important to acknowledge that this rebaselining effort is not complete, we continue to expect that the project schedule and capital cost forecast will be consistent with our prior estimates. And based on early indications, we also expect a reduction in the amount of remaining productive hours needed to complete the project. We expect to conclude the rebaseline effort prior to our first quarter call and Georgia Power will file a report with the Georgia PSC reflecting the results no later than May 15. The Public Service Commission staff will then have until July 31st to file their observations on the outcome of the rebaseline process with the Commission. In the appendix of our slide deck for this call, we've provided the most recent schedule performance index, cost performance index and percent complete metrics. While we continue to believe that these measures are the best indicators of progress at the site, please note that the charts provided for the schedule performance index and percent complete metrics, do not reflect the ongoing rebaselining effort and we believe it is likely that the most recent results shown on those charts are not representative of the current status of the project. We will provide an update on the results of the rebaselining effort, including an update on these key measures on our first quarter earnings call. On the regulatory front, the Georgia Public Service Commission voted yesterday to approve a stipulation between the PSC staff and Georgia Power that settled all issues in VCM 19, which included combining the filing of VCM 20 and 21 in August of 2019 at the request of the PSC staff. Combining the filings recognizing - recognizes the ongoing rebaselining effort and is designed to accommodate an unusually busy regulatory calendar in Georgia, which includes Georgia Power's triennial integrated resource plan filing and rate case filings for Georgia Power and Atlanta Gas Light. This action is not without precedent. Some of you may remember that in 2013, we made a similar determination with the PSC staff to combine VCMs 9 and 10 during Georgia Power's 2013 rate case. I'll turn the call over now to Drew for a financial and economic overview. Andrew Evans : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, adjusted results for the quarter and the full year exceeded our expectation. Due to the positive impact of weather and cost control for the full year, the related customer refund accruals occurred in the fourth quarter, so comparison of year-over-year adjusted fourth quarter earnings results is not particularly informative and I'll focus on the full year. For the full year, on an adjusted basis, Southern Company earned $3.13 billion or $3.07 per share in 2018, compared to $3.02 billion or $3.02 a share for 2017. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning\u2019s release and earnings package. Last year, as a result of the impacts of tax reform in our business, we reset the starting point of our expected long-term EPS growth trajectory to $2.87 per share. Our adjusted 2018 results of $3.07 per share were approximately 7% above the mid point of our original guidance range. This result was also above our updated guidance range disclosed on the second quarter call, which was increased due to performance through mid year and the Florida asset transactions. The major drivers versus 2017 were the positive effects of constructive regulatory outcomes and weather at our state regulated utilities, somewhat offset by increased depreciation and amortization, interest expense and share issuance. Importantly, we have also been successful in holding our non-fuel O&M expense flat at our state regulated electric utilities year-over-year as we continue to create and seek out operational efficiencies. Looking at some of the operational highlights, our generation system load was 4% higher in 2018 compared to 2017, representing our second highest load on record. The increase was primarily due to extreme cold temperatures in January and warmer than normal temperatures in September. We also experienced record gas burn and gas generation in 2018, due to higher loads throughout the year and lower gas prices in the second and third quarters. For 2018, our energy supply mix was comprised of 47% natural gas, 27% coal, 15% nuclear and 11% renewables. Notably, generation from coal plants continue to trend downward, which is in line with our stated carbon reduction objectives. Moving now to an economic review of the year, we continue to see robust net income - net-in migration, particularly in the Southeast. Across our regulated utilities, we added 41,000 new residential electric customers and 32,000 new residential gas meters during 2018. Our combined business territories continue to see slightly faster population growth than the rest of the nation, and in particular, Atlanta is currently the fourth fastest growing metro area in the United States. Retail electric sales growth for the year was approximately 1% on a weather-normalized basis, principally driven by this customer growth, with a minimal decline in customer usage. As we forecast future years, we anticipate the customer growth trend to continue, but we also expect a slight annual decline in customer usage. When looking at these two factors combined, our forecast for retail electric sales growth remains flat to 1%. While we achieved growth at the top end of this [ph] range in 2018, our guidance remains flat to 1% for 2019 for sales. The commercial customer class continues to grow. However, energy efficiency, eCommerce and other changes in business models are challenging overall demand growth. While there were signs of slowing momentum in the fourth quarter in selected industrial segments, industrial sales were strong for the year in 2018, with seven of our top 10 industrial segments posting year-over-year growth. Overall total employment growth remains strong in our service territories. Alabama and Georgia both outpaced the national average, with employment growth of 2.2% and 2.5% respectively. And developers continue to select sites in the Southeast for large-scale economic development projects. Before I turn the call back to Tom, I'd like to discuss our 2019 EPS guidance range and our long-term outlook. Our 2019 EPS guidance range is $2.98 per share to $3.10 per share. The $3.04 per share mid point represents growth of approximately 6% from $2.87 per share, the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance range. In the first quarter of 2019, we estimate that we will earn $0.70 per share, excluding a preliminary gain on the sale of Gulf Power currently estimated to be $1.28 per share, as well as any other adjustments in that period. Our expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 4% to 6%, using the same base of $2.87 per share that we established a year ago. This growth rate is driven by strong fundamentals across our state regulated electric and gas utilities, and a continued focus on cost control. We expect our state regulated utilities to comprise over 90% of total projected earnings through the five year horizon. Our long-term outlook continues to be driven by capital investment in our state regulated businesses. Our investment plan of $38 billion includes a projected rate base growth at our regulated utilities of approximately 6%. This updated plan reflects a $3.7 billion increase over last year\u2019s forecast for 2019 through 2022, excluding the previously disclosed Vogtle cost increase. The main drivers of the increase are significant incremental state regulated utility investments primarily related to the closure of ash ponds or environmental spend in Georgia and Alabama as we continue initiatives to modernize and increase the resilience of our electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. For Southern Power, the cumulative five year investment plan of $900 million is comprised entirely of previously announced projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet. We expect to remain opportunistic with regard to growth at Southern Power, seeking to deploy new capital for projects that meet our stringent risk and hurdle rate objectives, but any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power are expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded. We currently forecast the total equity need of $2.5 billion to $3 billion over the next five years. We have the capacity to fulfill most or all of our projected equity needs through our robust internal equity plans. However, we will continue to preserve all options and evaluate other potential equity alternatives. We have demonstrated discipline and agility in seeking the most efficient sources of equity in the past. 2018 could not be more indicative of this and we will remain equally thoughtful and investor focused as we fulfill our future equity needs. Financial integrity and strong credit metrics provide significant benefit to customers and investors, and it has always been a top priority for us. We've taken significant steps over the past year to deleverage our balance sheet, and in 2019 we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our credit metrics. Another long standing priority for Southern Company is providing a regular, predictable and sustainable return to shareholders through our dividend. We have an outstanding track record of dividend payments and growth. Over a 71 year period, dating back to 1948, we have paid 285 consecutive quarterly dividends that have been equal to or greater than the prior quarters. While future dividend policy is the purview of the Board of Directors, we are proud of this track record and we believe our financial outlook continues to support our objectives of growing the dividend $0.08 per year. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks. Thomas Fanning : Thank you, Drew. In closing, throughout 2018, we continued to execute across all our businesses, achieving outstanding results. The foundation of our business remains strong. Our customer focused business model, with an emphasis on outstanding reliability, best-in-class customer service and rates well below the national average continues to be the cornerstone of delivering value to customers and shareholders. Our credit profiles are significantly improved. We continue to project 4% to 6% long-term growth in our business and our employees across the franchise continue to deliver outstanding service to customers and the communities that we are privileged to serve. 2019 will be an extraordinarily important year for Southern Company, with particular focus on Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and investment in our state regulated businesses. We have a long track record of successfully executing on our business model and believe we are poised for continued success in the months and years ahead. We appreciate your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Fanning : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : Hey. Good morning. Thank you for the time. Just numbers look great, near-term outlook looks great. I just wanted to make sure I understand precisely the message you're trying to deliver on Vogtle today. It was just a tad confusing. Thomas Fanning : Okay. Greg Gordon : If I heard you correctly, you said, you were at 146 - productivity of 146 recently, you're at 140 today. The target was to be at 140 by March and that if you can maintain at least 110, you believe you can deliver the regulatory in-service date in November on the current cost schedule, is that correct? Thomas Fanning : Yes. In general, we \u2026 Greg Gordon : Because the reason I'm asking, sorry\u2026 Thomas Fanning : Go ahead. Greg Gordon : The reason I'm asking is, because you then said you're now rebaselining and I think - but the rebaselining, if my understanding is correct, is just delivering a schedule to the regulator that now reflects that aspiration? Thomas Fanning : It's all of that. Yes, it's - every so often. Say 18 months or so, we'll take a look at the schedule and based on everything. We have to kind of use schedule in discrete periods, right. We obviously look every week to optimize workflows and process, learning\u2019s from China as they have now achieved start-up, all of that goes into our thinking about, what the implications are for the work performed for the remaining construction period of the plant. All of that input goes into what we call rebaselining. And the outputs we believe, now, it's not gone yet, got to stress this to everybody, but everything that we see right now, as of today, says, cost and schedule are preserved and we expect to have to spend less hours to complete the project than what is currently in our budgets, okay? And if I just gave a little more refinement there, what we know today, what we believe today is at least a reduction in hours of around 600,000 hours. Now, there may be more, we'll see what happens. We\u2019ll deliver that when it becomes public as we conclude the rebaselining effort. So in general, what we said in October was, we needed to hit 140 by March. We've hit 140 in February. Last week, we hit 146,000. So we're very happy with the productivity and the staffing resources necessary to deliver productive hours per week, so good track. The challenge for us, can we sustain that from February of \u201819 to February of \u201820. You should expect that those numbers may bounce around during that period of time, but if we can average 140, we believe right now and this is before baselining is complete, that we'll be able to hit our more aggressive schedules. Recall, the schedule that we are focusing on paramount is November \u201821, November \u201822 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. It remains the case that we are working on site to April schedules. The idea there is to deliver more margin to the regulatory approved schedules by the Georgia Public Service Commission, okay. And we try to give you reference points. And let me just make sure we get those clear. On productive hours worked per week, we think if we average 110,000 hours per week, we could hit November schedules. Hitting anything better than that improves our likelihood of gaining margin to November. That's why we're targeting 140 or even above for this remainder of the period, February \u201819, February of \u201820. These numbers, we believe are consistent with the April schedule that we have in place. But again, we got to finish rebaselining, there's a lot that goes on. Even theoretically you could reduce hours and have a prolonged schedule maybe a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, something like that. It just depends on a whole lot of sequencing that goes on. But the point is, if we do better than 110, we\u2019re gaining margin to November. We're targeting 140,000, and we're doing a little better than that right now. One other point, these charts in the back, we had an argument internally about providing you those charts. That's okay. We fight all the time here. The charts are based on the old schedule. They do not include the new rebaselining and everything else. And let me just give you the reference point there. On CPI, if we can beat - I think, it's 1.4, CPI is 1.4, then we will do better than our budget that we're projecting for the November in-service dates. And schedule, if we can beat 1.3, we will do better than the November schedule. That's how we're evaluating those charts. Those are the reference points. Now, I'm sorry Greg, I went into a little bit detail, maybe more than you wanted, but I want to be very clear about where we are. Greg Gordon : No. That's exactly - Tom, that's exactly what I was asking. So, right now, you're creating margin against the November schedule. You will sort of quantify exactly what the current schedule is in the rebaselining process that you're going to submit to the Commission. And then as long as you can keep on track, you're continuing to create a little bit of above 110, you continue to create a little bit of headroom to the November in-service date. I think that's clear. I guess the one final question, then I'll jump to the back. You said you might be able to do it in fewer hours, just fewer hours mean actually a lower cost? I mean, is it really this times hour or are there other factors involved? Thomas Fanning : Yeah, there's other factors, the amount of commodities involved, and piping wire, stuff like that, certainly the cost of the units employed. I think we suggested \u2013 you know, there was all this conversation in the past about we need people from Canada and everything else and I still think that would be a good thing to have. What we did on the site was actually increase wages for electricians and pipe fitters to essentially top decile. Now, we were able to absorb those costs in our own variance without touching contingency. But there will be issues along the way that really deal with unit cost. Hours certainly matter and all of the things being equal, you have less hours, you have less cost, you have less schedule. But we can't say that with certainty until rebaselining is complete. So let us finish the work and we'll tell everybody what the results are once it's complete. Greg Gordon : Thank you, Tom. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Fanning : Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me? Thomas Fanning : Yes, sir. Hear you fine. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. So perhaps following up on Greg's question on Vogtle, if you don't mind. You talk about a reduction in the amount of remaining productive hours. Can you elaborate a little bit more? You may have already touched on this just a tad in the last question, but I want to hit that very specifically here. What is improving in terms of the underlying construction site from a productivity perspective? Thomas Fanning : Yes. So, if you recall, one of the big issues we talked about was - we kind of stated, we need more people, and once we get the people on the site, we got to get them productive. And I think, we've talked in the past about some guys, some - an electrician walks on the site, so we got a new person, but it takes him a while to get productive. We estimate that there is a little bit of friction, may take two weeks or so to get the person working at near best capability. So there is this issue of - what do we get about 75 people per week, getting them up to speed. And so you'll see some friction in the - especially the CPI metric. But as you get staffing where you need it and everybody starts to become productive, CPI should start to go down, and in fact, that's exactly what we're seeing on the site. So it's a function of getting people, getting them productive and then working better. The other factor that has been important here is not just attracting, but retaining people. And not only retaining, but also less absenteeism and a variety of other things. All of our compensation practices right now, incent people to stay, to have good attendance and to be productive. And I must say, we've had a terrific partnership with Bechtel. I want to make sure I call out my friend Brendan Bechtel and Jack Futcher and Barbara and the whole team there at Vogtle 3 and 4. We work with them day in and day out. And we continue to surprise ourselves, I think, with more productivity at the site. It goes to material management practices, it goes to work packages, just real kind of meat and potatoes, blocking and tackling kind of stuff. We continue to find ways to improve. Andrew Evans : Julien I think another\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Please. Andrew Evans : Another way for you maybe to think about this is that rebaselining is an effort to understand the number of hours that it takes to complete each of the tasks that are required for completion of the facility. And so, efficiency is an important measure, but after a year or so of operation, just really redefining what each individual task will take in terms of total hours that way we're not tracking against the curve that's incomplete. And everybody should know, Julien, we know it well, there is still a long way to go. Building margin is just smart. You just don't know what's going to happen in the future, we're showing a really good report today. It's important for us to continue to build the margin. That just insulates us against risk in the future. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just to reconcile this, the hiring ramp, I know you're already at these 140,000 plus hours a week. How do you think about that today, given the 700? You just mentioned a second ago about you would like to see potentially Canadian hires, but implied that it wasn't necessary at this point just, just where are we? Thomas Fanning : The Canada comment was just another arrow in the quiver should something else happen. We still have to go through outage season, will people stay with us, a variety of all, but that's just belt suspenders. We feel like everything we are doing right now is getting us the people we need. And in fact, what I would say is, pipe fitters, we're pretty well where we need to be. We do need a few more electricians down the road, but we are where we need to be right now and we'll assess hitting the market for more people later. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. It's composition of people rather than a hiring ramp at this point? Thomas Fanning : Yeah. We're actually very happy with where we are, and in fact, we have a backlog right now. So what does that mean? People see what's happening at the site, I think, word is spreading quickly. We've had great cooperation, Sean McGarvey, US Building Trades, they see this as a quality worksite, a safe worksite. They can count on the hours and so people are really attracted to come here now. So I think what we want to do is continue to see that. We've had more applications come in than we can process or want to process on the site. Like I said, we could process maybe 150 people on the site, but we couldn't make them productive. That would just be a cost measure. Our kind of target has been around 75 people per week. And so we have a backlog right now. We feel good about staffing, we feel good about making them productive. And the numbers that we show so far reflect that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you, guys. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Fanning : Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. I appreciate the extra information on the slides that you're going to update with the rebaselining. And the one you didn't talk about was that percent complete in your answer to Greg, Tom. And I was just curious, when you look at those December and January numbers, they seem to be a long way short even though you are exceeding your current target zone on hours worked. And should we expect that that gap will effectively be eliminated once you rebaseline? So, is that the right way to kind of think about how that's going to change or anything you could say to that picture? Thomas Fanning : That graph, I think is based on the aggressive schedule and it's based on an April target, okay. And it's on the old data. It's on the old kind of hours worked and everything else. So my sense is, there's really two pieces of information you don't see on that : one is, how does that compare to November; two is, it doesn't include the benefits of rebaselining. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Those sounds like putting them out together, it's safe to assume next time you show it to us, that gap between the blue and the green bars ought to be a lot smaller? Thomas Fanning : Yeah. And Jonathan let me just give you that. We chatted about that just before the call what that would look like. Now, this is highly imperfect. I'm giving you what we believe. We think at kind of this 140 plus level, we're going to be completing about 2% per month and that will essentially converge these two lines, but we need to show you that. Jonathan Arnold : Perfect. Thomas Fanning : We had a real debate about whether to show this or not. We said we would show it to you, that's why we put all these disclaimers up her. Jonathan Arnold : Well, having that answer, to explain it was very helpful. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Jonathan Arnold : Thank you for that. And then just one other, when we look back to some guidance, look back to how you showed your guidance last year, you had this 4% to 6% cone and the numbers coming in at the high end in 2019, including Vogtle, which you've obviously now affirmed, and then, drifting into the middle in \u201820, and toward the lower end in '21. I'm just curious, is that still the right kind of trajectory to be thinking about or is that old presentation now sort of redundant? Andrew Evans : Jonathan, I think that's still fair. You have to remember that what will actually be reported is still a function of the ROEs that are allowed during the construction period for Vogtle. And so that capital deployment does put a little bit of pressure on what would have been reported normally. Tom and I've talked a lot about this. I think, absent Vogtle, we're quite comfortable with our strength within that cone of earnings. Thomas Fanning : We'd be at the top end of the range. Andrew Evans : We'd be at the top end, but we are comfortable that we can stay within it even with the ROE depression that we get from Vogtle deployment. Thomas Fanning : And remember, Vogtle 3 and 4. I think, is 8% of our earnings, somewhere around there. Andrew Evans : Yes. Thomas Fanning : And just remember, during that period, especially '20 and '21, we're in that period where we have the lower ROEs associated with incremental expenditures. But recall, once we clear '21 and '22, once you get these units in, the trajectory really accelerates. It looks like an 8% kind of number out there from say '20 to '22, or '21 to '23. So it has a little bit of a shape and it shouldn't surprise anybody. You all have known about the regulatory settlement with Georgia for some time. I'm happy that if you look at our range this year, it shows that the top side, 8% over 2.87. And the bottom side is anchored in the bottom of our 4% growth rate. Andrew Evans : The most significant difference probably year-over-year is that we really are focusing our efforts on this $38 billion worth of investment into regulated enterprise. We continue to identify projects, whether environmental or modernization, and transmission and distribution. We're still exploring opportunity around migration of the generating fleet to a less carbon intensive mode. And so I think that these will be a series of updates as we explore these options through '20 and '21, but this is our single best projection of our future, I think, today. Thomas Fanning : Yeah. And one more just point of interest, the Georgia Commission has always been innovative and creative. For the first time in our IRP, we introduced a section called Resilience, and it really talks about thinking differently about the electric system. In other words, integrating in concepts of resilience beyond transmission lines and generating plants to gas pipelines and what are all the implications of storage and how can we think differently about the make, move and sell concept in terms of improving the reliability and ultimately the resilience to customers. These are really important concepts. Jonathan Arnold : Great. And just what one high scheming [ph] item, did you end up sharing with customers in Georgia in 2018? Thomas Fanning : Yeah. In fact, and Drew probably knows better than I do, but I said on TV this morning, we shared - I mean we gave benefits to customers this year of around $2 billion, $1.8 billion from tax reform. They got about two thirds of the benefit. And then another $200 million or so, perhaps more, 209 is what people are showing me right now, in terms of sharing. Jonathan Arnold : You got it. And equally weighted across Alabama and Georgia? Thomas Fanning : Yeah. Jonathan Arnold : Or closely equivalent. Thomas Fanning : We love to have the regulatory mechanisms. If the company does well, customers do well. Jonathan Arnold : Great. All right. Well, thanks a lot guys. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Fanning : Angie, how are you? Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. So no questions about Vogtle from me for a change. So, we saw the IRP filing from Georgia Power. We're still waiting to see what the Alabama Power files. And given the changes in the sharing mechanism for any over earning, I was just wondering, I mean, we obviously still expect this earnings pivot during construction at Vogtle, but is there a way to minimize that earnings slowdown from Alabama Power? Thomas Fanning : From Alabama Power? Angie Storozynski : Meaning like just have some strength in Alabama Power earnings in order to offset the temporary weakness in earnings at Vogtle? Thomas Fanning : So I like what you're saying. Look, yes, we talk a lot about this. I think our plan, we call it optionality. We've got lots of singles we can hit here, lay aside any home runs, lots of little singles we can hit along the way, that we think we can optimize plants, but particularly in '21, is kind of the year we're focused on. We certainly have the ability to do that. Andrew Evans : I think ascribing it to Alabama perhaps is a little bit unfair. We'll look at a variety of options across unregulated complex in total, Alabama's going to seek to do what's in the best interest of their customers at all times related to rate and return. Thomas Fanning : Yes. Thank you, Drew. That clarification is exactly right. And in fact, when we think about - and we haven't talked about it yet, but kind of investor friendly asset sales and all the stuff, we were very active last year. We have a lot more opportunity to do things here. I would view it more as pruning. We just announced Mankato and we expect to close that I guess by June or so. There's more of that to do, whether it's Southern Power, PowerSecure, things like that, we'll see. Andrew Evans : Perfect example is hyper investment in unregulated subsidiary generally leads to some dilution in the near term. We can produce a better earnings profile out of that business in the short term by utilizing its own assets to fund its development. And as Tom said, maybe prune back a little bit and things that are a little less strategic or find opportunities for people have a different view of value than we do. Thomas Fanning : And we certainly have done that in '18. And one more comment, boy, we have a great appetite within our operating companies, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, the Gas business to where without forcing anything, we're not backing in the numbers. These are things that we can identify, whether it's ash ponds or resilience in the transmission system, that's very reasonable on things that we should do for the benefit of customers. The other trade we've made, you've heard about modernization, reducing O&M significantly. Georgia has done a heck of a lot of that. Mississippi, just give you an example, have reduced over the years personnel at that company from 1500 to now about a 1,000, little over 1,000. So we're really taking money out of the business. We are creating headroom to invest in matters of resilience and technology to improve customer service. Georgia Power withdrew from a lot of its local offices - bill paying [ph] offices and yet increased customer touch through technology by four times. We have lots of opportunity to do better. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And just one other question, so your large cap peers seem to be pursuing a lots of growth from commercial renewables. I know that you have some growth embedded in your plans for Southern Power? But how do you see this, is this just more as a way to basically give you some flexibility around that 4% to 6% earnings growth or would you think that commercial renewables are still delivering attractive returns and as such should be pursued? Thomas Fanning : Yeah. Angie, that's terrific point to raise, and we've debated about how to talk about this. Let me just tell you what our point of view is and let the other companies speak for themselves. We find - especially in the current environment, we find that solar and wind margins are shrinking pretty dramatically, and we\u2019ll still be active. I guess we have a placeholder in our financial plan of something like $500 million a year for this stuff. We don't expect to spend it. We expect more to be in the $200 million range. And that's really a function of the market. You recall when the market was hot, we played really hard. On the other hand, we have a tremendous appetite inside our franchise businesses to spend more CapEx. What you're seeing with us is an intentional reallocation of CapEx away from those markets to our franchise markets. And it really is a function of need and weighted average cost of capital and what we expect the market will deliver. Andrew Evans : We're certainly not turning away from the concept of renewables. In fact, Georgia Power included over 1,000 mega watts of renewables within their most recent IRP. And so, I think you might see the form of that investment change a little bit. But as Tom said, as we look at things in the unregulated space, it's not only the margins that have declined, but perhaps the duration of contract and the credit quality of counter party. It simply falls through some of our return expectations. And so we just have to evaluate these things on a case-by-case basis and make sure they're accretive to shareholder value. Thomas Fanning : Let me - he made such a good point, so let me underline it. Value is a function of risk and return. Returns are down in that market in our opinion, risk is up because the duration of the contract available is down, we don't find that all that attractive. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you very much. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Fanning : Praful, how are you? Praful Mehta : Good, how are you? Thomas Fanning : Super. Praful Mehta : Well, thank you for taking the question. I guess going back to Vogtle, if you don't mind. Great progress so far and great to see that you're tracking to your faster internal schedule. I guess, just wanted to understand a little bit on the testing phase. I know that, that will start at some point in terms of testing all the equipment. How would you see that and do you see any uncertainty being added to your schedule as you get to that testing phase? Andrew Evans : Man, you're right on the money. This is the next big thing to talk about. So coming out the kind of July reset and then into the October earnings call or November earnings call, whenever it was, setting the trajectory, and getting people on-site and getting them productive was the most important thing we could do. We already have been involved in some turnover from construction to start up. So that actually has been ongoing. None of those systems that in the past have been all that critical in terms of critical path to schedule. Frankly, we haven't done as well as we would like to do on those early efforts. But we are now laser focused on what it's going to take in order to move out of construction phase in the start-up phase. Let me just tell you, if we stay on this April schedule, conceivably, you could have fuel load as early as for Unit 3, October of 2020, that's 18 months away. So we are right now in a big time mode on focusing, taking in systems, turning them over to the start-up folks and that's not only the construction and operation, but the paperwork and all the stuff we have in place to get the iTech [ph] complete to go to high fuel load. We have integrated teams in place, we have some of the best people around the United States, out own people, Bechtel, and we're very happy with kind of where we are right now. You should know also, this is an area of great learning from China. We have seen what they've done at Sandman and Haiyang. We've taken best practices. And in fact, we are thinking - even in the part of the rebate lining is, rethinking the schedule and sequence of the major events in the schedule to give us more certainty on the turnover package issue. This will be the next big thing to talk about. And we have talked internally about some graphics and some other ways to give you some transparency as to how this is going. Right now, we want to make sure we've got people, got them productive. The next thing will be our progress on the question you raised. Praful Mehta : Got you. Thomas Fanning : And man, let me just add two more things. One way to talk about this is, just what are the big kind of systems that you should watch, one is, initial Energy Station, we think that's going to happen in the second quarter, and then the integrated flush of the system. This is essentially where you take water and move it through the pipes, you clean out the pipes, and you get ready to operate. That's kind of the integrated flush, third quarter. And that's one way to talk about, but you got imagine there is lot of systems that go - underlie all these big issues. If we hit these big issues on time, we should hit the little issues on time. So, we're going to work hard to find a way to communicate this with you. Praful Mehta : Got it. And that is super helpful. So as you think about the testing phase, building in some cushion through the current phase as you enter testing is probably what you're trying to track for given there is a little bit of uncertainty at least in terms of how that testing would go, is that fair? Thomas Fanning : Sure. Hey, let me add one more thing that is just important. I know people love to complain about government and everything else, I would argue that this administration has been very helpful. Congress has been very helpful. In fact, even the past administrator was helpful on building Vogtle. The NRC is a very tough regulator. They are very exacting and requiring, as they should be, and we work well with them. One of the things that when we got the AP1000 technology approved, if you remember, way back then by the NRC, there was a lot of first of a kind issues with that technology. Now, with Sandman and Haiyang operating, we were able to work with the NRC to eliminate what had been required as first of a kind test issues. So, those issues have been eliminated or lessened and that has added about three weeks to our margin. So we're very happy to continue to work with the NRC to look for innovative, creative ways to help achieve the schedules we have in place. Praful Mehta : As usual very comprehensive answer. So really appreciate that. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Praful Mehta : I guess just quickly moving onto the finance side. Just to quickly test, on the equity, you've mentioned $2.5 billion to $3 billion over five years. Was there any clarification around strategic asset sales or other M&A transactions as a part of that? I wasn't clear on that point, so just wanted to clarify, could that equity number come down as you look at more M&A transactions? Andrew Evans : First, I think a simple answer to your question is, absolutely, it could. What we wanted to demonstrate though is that we can meet the requirements of the plan that we've laid out for ourselves just using the internal plans at our disposal. And so, it's basically dividend reinvestment in any option exercise that occurs. I think '18 has been very indicative of the approach that we'll take, but I would say the majors have been done or are in process for 2019. We're always looking to prune and make sure that there are opportunities to kind of refocus smaller business lines and we're going to be as opportunistic around those things as we possibly can this year. Thomas Fanning : And if I could just beat some good news accomplishment. I think, we bought well and we sold well. I think we demonstrate terrific discipline in that. I think the AGL acquisition was a terrific one for shareholders. I think SONAT was a terrific one for shareholders. When you think about what we were able to do in '18, we sold a gas business in New Jersey and a few other places for 37 times earnings. The highest multiple ever paid for a gas business. The Florida gas business we sold was I think tied - right at tied for the second highest multiple ever paid. Gulf was the highest multiple paid in our knowledge for any electric company. When you think about just other ways to dimension that, we were carrying assets at the time at $45 a share and sold them for $90 bucks a share. We sold 5% of our earnings for 12% of our market cap. So, it wasn't just that we were raising money. We were historically raising money with valuations that people hadn't seen before. These were all very accretive, very friendly to shareholders. Praful Mehta : Got it. Well, thanks again, guys. Appreciate it. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Fanning : Hi, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hi. Good morning. On rate-base growth versus earnings growth, it looks like the - especially on the electric side, it looks like the electric rate base growth profile is a little higher, about 1% higher and that's taking out Gulf Power and I guess replacing it with more ash pond CapEx. I'm wondering if that's going up and it looks like the incremental equity is a little bit less than half of the incremental CapEx overall. All those things would seem to indicate higher guidance growth rate going forward, but the growth rate is basically the same growth rate off that 2018 mid-point. Is that - maybe just talk about what is it about the translation from rate base growth to earnings growth that's keeping the earnings growth about the same? Andrew Evans : So this is a little like the question, I think, we took earlier and really relates to the shape of our - or the path of our growth through that 4% to 6% earnings expectation. We know that we're going to have pressure related to Vogtle with construction investment over the next three year period, and so it doesn't translate as you see it here, 6% growth in state-regulated - or 6% growth in electric utility to a full 6% growth at the corporation. I don't know that we'd be particularly doing ourselves a benefit by moving our growth ranges around to the time when we are really focused on execution on Vogtle, but we'll kind of revisit that idea when we\u2019re substantially complete there. Thomas Fanning : But even with Vogtle, we're within the 4% to 6% count. And if you look at the end, like I suggested before, the shape, for whatever flatter kind of performance you will get through '21, it really takes off once you start clearing 3 and 4. And it looks more like 8% growth at that point. Andrew Evans : And Michael, you are correct, the vast majority of the change here relates to environmental CapEx and also some modernization of the T&D infrastructure over that period. But our change is little over $4 billion or kind of in that proximity and really is almost entirely in regulated enterprises. Thomas Fanning : Yes. And I just want to add, these aren't made up numbers. They're not like what do we need to fill a hole and let's create CapEx to do that. These are projects that we know about, they are sensible and they help customers. Andrew Evans : Identified and largely filed. Thomas Fanning : Yes. Michael Weinstein : No. I appreciate your comment also about I guess the increased competitiveness on the non-regulated renewables side. I'm also noticing that the amount of CapEx that's going into the gas pipelines segment declines over time. And I'm just wondering if that is also sort of an area that you might be thinking about divesting at some point? Thomas Fanning : Divesting, it's an interesting question. I think we will continue to look at opportunity within the midstream. We really enjoy the investment there that we have in SONAT, Dalton, the construction that was completed a year and a half ago that's brought tremendous benefit I think to the customers of Georgia. The same can be said of other two constructions, although they are much smaller in terms of relative contribution to the - particularly the first one that I mentioned, but divestiture, I don't know, I think as these things get to commercial operation, we'll just have to assess whether they're better held by us or by others. Andrew Evans : Yes. And the old joke around here is, strategic means the numbers don't work. SONAT is strategic and the numbers work. It's a wonderful annuity. That's another one, where we bought well, I think. And as you mentioned, Dalton, is perfect for our system. There's high synergy with those assets. Thomas Fanning : The primary goal is to bring low cost gas into our service territories and to the extent that we can continue to do that, SONAT certainly does into the Southeast for both the gas and electric businesses. ACP or PennEast Pipeline into Illinois, anything that's in service of customer, probably fits in our portfolio. Michael Weinstein : And just one final question about PowerSecure. So I mean that was a relatively recent purchase. And I guess you're thinking about it being a non-strategic asset at this point, does that mean you are\u2026 Thomas Fanning : No. Hope I didn't communicate that, PowerSecure, we think is a really important thing. In fact, somebody - I think it was Angie asked before about generation in commercial and industrial realm. In fact, that's what we've seen. The last three win deals we've done have been General Mills, General Motors and a cruise line. Here's the point, we see the age of big iron making, moving and selling at scale, central station power units, as potentially slowing down and dissipating over time, won't go away. And I can't tell you the timeframe in which this is happening, but I think it's happening to some degree now. And then what we see in its place is something we refer to as distributed infrastructure. So now think about make, move and sell on the customer premises. And so we think that a certain combination of Southern Power as it applies to Angie's question, the commercial and industrial segment, along with the strategic portion of PowerSecure really do matter. And also we are finding in the market elements of Sequent, really include Sequent in our guidance and all that stuff. That is a subsidiary that's part of the gas infrastructure. Their major purpose in life beyond managing the pipeline investments we have, like SONAT is to make sure that the pipelines are full of gas, and that we have efficient operation. Customers are finding now that if we can handle their fuel management issues, that synergy along with distributed infrastructure has great appeal and may fill up this gap that's developing on what we call distributed infrastructure. There is a whole lot about PowerSecure that is a very strategic. There are elements perhaps that may not be, and we'll figure that out over time. Andrew Evans : You have to really put that investment in context of size and it does show up in our capital deployment. It's just not as capital intensive as the core business is\u2026 Thomas Fanning : It's tiny. Andrew Evans : This is - an experiment is not the correct word, probably very important for us to be able to understand how the distributed generation market develops. We have a good sense of it in our own service territories, but there are others that are further along in their journey, whether that's sort of out west of us or otherwise. And so, I think we'll continue to invest in that business to understand how distributed generation might change the utility business in total, it's a very important way for us to understand the markets. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Well, thank you very much for your time. Appreciate it. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides : Hey, Tom. Thank you for taking my question. Mine is going to be really, really quick. When looking at the capital spend guidance, the one thing that kind of stood out is, there's very little at the regulated electrics for any new generation in the next few years, meaning, next three or four, three to five years. Just curious, are you guys being conservative about whether there's an opportunity to build renewables in rate base or whether as you potentially retire or run your coal units even less often, whether new gas fired generation in rate base would be needed? Andrew Evans : I'd say if you look at the projections today, it's more the lack of having these items here or probably more around the uncertainty of whether or not there will be - the IRPs will reflect them. However, we are in process with IRPs in Georgia and ultimately in Alabama and expect at least 1,000 megawatts of renewables will be built within the Georgia portfolio. Thomas Fanning : And we're always looking over our hand in terms of the economics of the best mix of capacity we've got. It wouldn't surprise me. We've announced some stuff in the IRP at Georgia, Hammond, Macintosh, to see more of that thinking elsewhere in the system. It's just tough to think about all of the expense, whether it's O&M, environmental, everything else supporting the coal fleet. We think that is a drumbeat that will continue. And as technologies developed, whether they are renewables or new, highly efficient gas or storage, we\u2019ll take that into account as well. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Fanning : Hey, Ali, how are you? Ali Agha : Good. Thanks, Tom. Good morning. Thomas Fanning : Good morning. Ali Agha : First question, I just wanted to be certain, in the past you all had given us a net income profile for Vogtle depending on the construction timeline and the ROE hits that you've been alluding to. Is that still a good profile to be using for modeling purposes? Thomas Fanning : I think so. If it's not, we'll cover that with you offline, but I don't think anything has changed materially there. Ali Agha : Okay. Also a couple of your utilities have obviously seen an increase in there all-sized [ph] equity ratios in the recent past. Again, for your planning purposes, as you look out long-term and the 4% to 6% growth, are you assuming that those higher equity ratios stay where they are or how are you thinking about that as future rate cases are coming up? Andrew Evans : We are assuming that they stay in place, assuming that tax law stays as it is. You'll probably remember that the adjustments to capital structure really were simply for maintenance of the current credit quality of the utilities, as they existed prior to reform. And so, Ali, we do expect that will continue. That'll be adjudicated in Georgia over the next few months for both Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Power. We\u2019re working to make some progress in the State of Illinois. And Alabama, had I think really, really strong commitment from their regulators to maintain the credit quality of their business. And so, comfortable with how we've described in the projection. Thomas Fanning : And let me tell you something, if I could give a quick policy argument, tax reform as they've done it, has been so beneficial to so many people. The argument against it is, only the fat cats, the rich people benefit. It's dead wrong in our business. The way we've structured it, something like $1.8 billion of some sort of rate reductions accrue, whether they are refunds or other sort of rate reductions accrue to customers. And 46% of our customers make less than $40,000 a year and when you look at that segment, energy budget is a high part of their disposable income. This has a direct positive impact on some of the people in our economy that needed the most. This has been a great outcome. Ali Agha : Got you. And just one quick question. The effective tax rate, if we get little bit right on your adjusted earnings was slightly lower than I think what you were expecting earlier, is this a good sort of run rate to be thinking about in future years as well? Andrew Evans : I think the largest change year-over-year was the impact of tax reform. But let me get back to you in terms of the effective rate and the cash tax rate. I don't think it's very differently, significantly from our original expectation. Little bit of movement perhaps related to gains on sale of assets, but that would be the principal difference. Ali Agha : I got you. Thank you. Thomas Fanning : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Association. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Fanning : Paul, glad to have you with us. Paul Patterson : Good to be here. Listen, I mean you guys have really pretty much covered everything with Vogtle, just a quick follow-up on the staff testimony in November, sort of raised some concerns about the 29 month extension and what have you and I was just wondering, 29 months, right? Andrew Evans : Yes. Paul Patterson : And I just wanted to sort of get a sense as to what sort of changed between November and now, other than what you guys have already gone over? I mean, I guess it would appear that things have really improved quite a bit. And perhaps that skepticism, if they were to write it today, would be less and I'm not asking you to speak for them, But if you can address, I mean you guys never really I think filed rebuttal testimony or anything. So that's why, I was just wondering if you could just fill in a little bit there as to why they had so much skepticism then and sort of the outlook now? Thomas Fanning : Yes. So you hit my first answer right on the head. And that is, I don't want to speak for the staff. Look, if you just look at the facts right now, whether it's productive hours per week, a 110,000 versus a 140,000 plus hours work per week, we're developing margin to November. We\u2019re able to get the staff we need. We haven't eaten into any of the contingency. So, schedule, costs, productivity, these numbers look pretty good. Now, we have to sustain them, and maybe things that we don't know, the unknown are unknowns. We have the units in China working well. So we know the technology works. So here's the thing, I think - just as I indicated on an earlier question, I think that we're able to demonstrate we get staff, we get them productive, we are working. I think the next big issue is going to be turnover. And I know Dr. Jacobs, who we dearly love, he is a really smart guy and works with us, and sits in all our meetings, that's part of his area of expertise. But how we move from construction now to the start-up, looking toward half fuel load, potentially as soon as 18 months away, is kind of the big issue right now. And we'll talk more about that in calls ahead. Paul Patterson : Okay. Listen, everything else has been answered and congratulations. Thomas Fanning : Thank you. Really appreciate it. Paul Patterson : Okay. Hang in there. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas Fanning : No. We're really happy to be able to report these results. It's the productive work of thousands of people, making thousands of good decisions every day. I want to call out Bechtel, our partner on this important Vogtle journey that we're on. I think we're in good shape right now. The challenge is going to be keep the momentum going, sustain the progress and continue to execute the way we have. The financial plan is awfully robust. I think, we've demonstrated agility in being able to respond to changed conditions in some of the best regulatory environments in the United States. We expect that will continue. Lots of important work ahead in '19, but I think we're poised to execute and do well during this year. Thank you for your followership of this Company and we'll continue to work on your behalf as hard as we can. Have a great week. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Brigit, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session with instructions on how to queue up for questions. Please note that today's conference is being recorded Tuesday, May 1, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thanks, Brigit. Good morning, and welcome to Southern Company's first quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Thomas Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Thomas Fanning. Thomas Fanning : Good morning. And thank you all for joining us. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.70 on an adjusted basis for the first quarter consistent with our estimates, despite significantly warmer than normal weather across our Southeast service territory. I am extremely pleased with our performance year-to-date, and believe we are well positioned to achieve our financial targets for 2019. In addition to solid financial performance, during the first quarter, we have executed on several strategic initiatives. Earlier this month, we announced the pending sale of the Nacogdoches generating facility to Austin Energy for $460 million. Additionally, we still expect to close the $650 million sale of the Mankato facility midyear. But probably, the biggest issue to report on this call is the completion of our Plant Vogtle 3 and 4 rebaselining efforts. Late yesterday, Georgia Power filed the rebaseline report with the Georgia Public Service Commission. That report confirms the regulatory approved in-service date of November 2021 and November 2022 for Unit 3 and Unit 4, respectively. Additionally, there is no change in our total estimated cost to complete. The rebaselining process has been valuable and has increased our confidence in meeting the regulatory approved in-service dates. The resulting weekly work plan has been recalibrated and supports our strategy of working to an aggressive weekly plan onsite, which is currently expected to provide a 6-month margin to the regulatory approved in-service dates. We now estimate that we would need to average about 100,000 weekly earned hours through the start of Unit 3 hot functional testing that's essentially the completion of the construction phase of the unit to meet the regulatory approved schedule. Each week we perform above that level should provide margin to the November in-service dates. Again, we continue to employ a strategy that maintains an aggressive work plan on-site with an objective or providing margin to the regulatory approved schedule. We have balanced the relationship between costs and schedule, and we have resequenced parts of the construction plan. That, plus the expected gives and takes the re-estimating the remaining work and the hours required to complete it, has changed the shape of our production ever. Our revised work plan requires a productivity ramp targeting an average of 160,000 weekly earned hours for eight months between the late summer of 2019 and spring of 2020. To execute this aggressive work plan, we expect to increase craft levels and support resources in a measured fashion similar to what we have accomplished over the last six months. Remember, this work plan currently provides six months of margin in support of our primary objective of successful completion of Units 3 and 4 on or before November 2021 and November 2022, respectively. Progress has continued on at the site as we've accomplished all of the project's key stated objectives for the first quarter of 2019, which included setting the top head for Unit 3 containment vessel. Overall, including engineering, procurement and initial test plan, the project is approximately 77% complete. For Unit 3 direct construction is 66% complete with a target of approaching 90% complete by year-end. Since beginning of the year, we've averaged approximately 130,000 earned hours per week with four weeks at or above 140,000 hours meeting our expected year-to-date total earned hours. In our slide deck for this call, we provided the most recent Schedule Performance Index, Cost Performance Index and percent complete metrics for your reference. These are all construction centric metrics based on the site's aggressive work plan. As we have discussed previously, perhaps now, the clearest indicator of success will be our progress in meeting key milestones related to system turnover and testing within a reasonable margin to the site work plan. For 2019, the three key project milestones for Unit 3 are initial energization, the start of integrated flush and testing of the main control room. We expect a complete initial energization on schedule in the next few weeks. The start of integrated flush is expected during the third quarter. And the main control room should be ready for testing around the end of the year with United 3 hot functional testing expected just over a year away. We will continue to optimize the schedule and work plan at the site. And we are committed to keeping our stakeholders informed. I'll turn the call now over to Drew to cover our quarterly performance in greater detail. Andrew Evans : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, in the first quarter of 2019, we achieved earnings per share of $0.70 on an adjusted basis, which was in line with the expectation that we provided on our last call. This compares to $0.88 on an adjusted basis for the first quarter of 2018. The primary drivers of the change were $0.11 related to earnings from divested assets, and $0.07 of negative weather year-over-year. We're thinking about the reduction associated with recent divestitures, keep in mind that we expect the transition for transactions to be EPS accretive on a full year basis, after taking into account avoided equity issuance related to increased equity ratios at our regulated utilities last year. And to put the weather impact into context for you, while, some areas of the country saw colder than normal country temperatures during the quarter, temperatures across our Southeast service territory were 25% warmer than normal, representing the second warmest first quarter in the last 20 years. We were able to overcome this weather impact through diligent focus on controlling costs during the quarter. A detailed reconciliation of our rent are reported in adjusted results is included in the morning's release and the earnings package. Taking a look at customer growth, we added 12,000 residential electric and over 7,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities, which is slightly higher than total residential customer additions for the same period in 2018. This customer growth is driven primarily by job and population growth in our Southeast service territory that outpaces the national average. Weather adjusted electric customer usage was down approximately 1% year-over-year during the first quarter due to a combination of factors, including continued energy efficiency and technology advancements across all customer segments, a slowing pace of new commercial customer addition and weakness in industrial sales due largely to several temporary plant outages in our territory. Looking ahead, we continue to expect combined growth and usage for retail electric sales to be flat to 1% for the year. While we see some signs of modest economic cooling across the commercial and industrial classes, economic development activity in the Southeast remains strong. During the first quarter, major companies like Airbus, Carmax and U.S. Deal announced new projects in our service territories expected to create over 8,000 new jobs. Taking into account our first quarter performance, economic indicators and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we still expect to achieve our adjusted full-year EPS guidance of $2.98 to $3.10 per share. And our estimate for the second quarter of 2019 is $0.71 per share. As Tom mentioned earlier this month, Southern Power announced the pending sale of its 115 megawatt Nacogdoches generating facility to Austin Energy for $460 million. In this transaction, we are divesting of the only biomass facility in Southern Power's portfolio, yet another example of our ongoing commitment to simplify the business. The Nacogdoches sales expected to close in mid 2019. In aggregate, our 2018 and 2019 divestitures have proven to be an efficient source of equity with a substantially lower cost of capital than issuing new common shares. These transactions have also enabled us to significantly strengthen Southern Company's balance sheet as evidenced by the $4 billion or over 25% reduction in holding company debt year-over-year. We have consistently demonstrated tremendous discipline as both a buyer and seller of assets. We will maintain this disciplined approach as we continue to be thoughtful and strategic and seeking to further improve our state regulated utility-centric growth profile. On the financing front, I'd also like to highlight the $1.67 billion additional Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program that was closed in March for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This brings our total authorized BOE financing capacity for Vogtle 3 and 4 to $5.13 billion, of which we've drawn approximately $3.5 billion to date. As always, customers are at the center of everything we do, and when compared to traditional financing methods, we estimate this program saves our Georgia customers over $500 million. We appreciate the continued partnership of the DOE as we work to bring Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online. I'd now like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.48 per share. This is our 18th consecutive annual increase. And for 71 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than the previous year. The Board's decision to increase the dividend reinforces the strength and sustainability of Southern Company's businesses, business and supports our objective of providing superior risk adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long term. Before I turn it back over to Tom, I'd like to give you a brief update on our regulatory calendar for the remainder of the year. We plan to file base rate cases with the Georgia Public Service Commission for both Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Power in mid-summer. We expect to ease Georgia proceedings as well as depending rate case for Nicor Gas in Illinois to conclude in late 2019. Mississippi Power is scheduled to file a base rate case with the Mississippi PSC in the fourth quarter of 2019. And in addition, we expect Georgia PSC's review of the Georgia Power integrated resource plan to be completed in July. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you. Thomas Fanning : Thank you. I will now touch on some early progress on our carbon reduction initiatives, and then we'll take your questions. Last summer, we announced the goal to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 with the transition the low to no-carbon by 2050. Looking at our energy supply, during the first quarter, 30% of electric generation was from carbon-free resources, so nuclear, hydro, wind and solar. Generation from coal declines from 27% in the first quarter of 2018 to 23% for the first quarter in 2019, and the balance was generated by natural gas. The decline in coal generation will do mainly to low natural gas prices in higher hydro generation in the first quarter. In addition, continued low natural gas prices coupled with higher operating costs led to the recent announcement to retire 2,000 megawatts of older coal units across the system. The transition of our generation fleet delivers to our customers and optimize portfolio of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy. In closing, I'd like to highlight that Southern Company recently ranked number 14 on Forbes Magazine 2019 List of America's Best Employers. Of the 500 large employers ranked, Southern Company was number 1 among industry peers, and number 1 in Georgia. This is the second consecutive year that Southern Company ranked in the Top 20. A key to successfully building the future of energy is acquiring and developing top talent. Recognition at the Forbes ranking is a positive affirmation that we are indeed creating a culture that furthers this goal. Again, we're very pleased with our start of the year from both a financial and operational perspective. We remain keenly focused on the progress of Vogtle 3 and 4, and our committed to keeping you informed as we reached key milestones on this important project. Thank you for joining us this morning. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We do welcome all questions or comments. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Gordon : I only have one question. But as Ronny Dangerfield said, it's in 27 parts. Thomas Fanning : Yes. I feel free. Fire away, my friend. Greg Gordon : So two questions : one is how often just that we can level set expectations. Do you expect to give us update now that you've rebaseline the schedule on where you stand in terms of optimization of performance at the site and where you are inside that made a November timeframe? Will we get it quarterly, will we get it semi annually? How are you going to keep us up to date and how things are trending? Thomas Fanning : Well, certainly, you'll get it via filings of the Georgia Public Service Commission. You'll get it on the earnings call for sure. So it's really whatever happens at the Georgia Public Service Commission augmented by these calls. Look, when we look at the re-baseline, we were very pleased with the result of it. It confirms what we thought we knew and actually gave us greater certainty to the November in-service dates. We talked a lot about would we do more rebaselining? I'm just guessing right now. So this is not factual. This is my judgment. We won't do another rebase on 3. We will look at 4. But we feel pretty good about the results and that's a decision we would make in a year or so. The other thing everybody should just realize is every week we re-optimize, we try to rebound. We try to improve our current state. This rebaselining thought was a big teary effort that required a lot of manpower. I think if I had to guess, probably no more rebaselining through the project, but we'll reassess that, particularly for Unit 4 and a year or so. Greg Gordon : Okay. And my second question is with regard to the increase in the five year CapEx forecast. At the same time, you've raised more capital through assets sales. So what's the current assumed common equity need when you net out the success you've had with asset sales offset by the opportunity now and necessity to deploy more capital into the core utility businesses? And could that be reduced by even further pairing down to the asset base? Andrew Evans : Greg, this is Drew. So the total plan is for us to invest about $38 billion over the plan period. And we were purposeful in construction of that plan in meeting number of our goals with largest of which is make sure that we can grow earnings per share about 4% to 6% over the time period. What that plan told us in this last iteration, or what we described with a need to issue about $500 million worth of equity in each year of the plan or about $2.5 billion -- little more than $2.5 billion in aggregate. Mankato was certainly a transaction that we had included in the plan. And Nacogdoches, not as a placeholder, but it was a little more resident in our thinking. And so, I wouldn't say that these two transactions will reduce that need for $2.5 billion worth of equity. But we will evaluate options over time. We will look at our liquidity and how it evolves over that five year period to really establish when we might build a turn that really to -- principally the dividend reinvestment program off. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski : So two questions. One is can you give us a sense how the pump issue at Sandman is or might be impacting Vogtle? And secondly, the experts company that the staff with Georgia Power has hired us to oversee the Vogtle site. Do you have any sense of what their take will be or is on the COD of Unit 3 and 4? Thomas Fanning : Yes, sure. Yes, absolutely. So with respect to the RCP, I think, we have people on-site there. And Chinese investing out have been really good in allowing our folks insight as to what's happening on the site for all issues. Of course, with respect to the RCP that was announced publicly, I guess, in March, you should know that there are 16 of these pumps between the two plants, 15 of the 16 are doing fine. The one piece of equipment that failed on this one pump is really a fastener of the pump. It's not an internal for the pump. And it's a very small piece of circular metal. I don't know it looks like a ring of pattern or something. They're doing a root cause analysis, and we'll see what happened. We don't believe there's any systemic problem. The rest of the plants are operating fine. And when you start up a plant like this, it's not surprising you have this kind of issue. So how did it impact Vogtle 3 and 4? Certainly, we are keenly interested. We continue to learn from this issue and any other issue on Sandman and Haiyang. And so we evaluate kind of plants that may arise here at Vogtle 3 and 4. For example, under the leadership of Steve Kuczynski and Glen Chick on-site, when we first heard about this RCP, we created a tiger team of engineers and construction people to go in and evaluate. Well, what if there was a problem that did impact us, what would we do? So we actually have now contingency plans in place to be able to manage any of the problems. Right now, we don't foresee any problems at Vogtle 3 and 4. And I can go further if you want. But right now, it appears to be limited to one pump, 15 to 16 are fine. It doesn't appear to be a systemic or design issue. The other issue you raise is really kind of an interesting issue. One of the things I do know, the independent monitor, Dr. Jacob is a terrifically smart guy. And I know, in his background, one of his particular areas of expertise is this notion of turnover from construction to startup, so that testing process. And Angie, that's why we try to draw people's attention now to the milestone. And really now focus on, of course, we're focused on the rest of construction. So it's moving from construction to startup, I think now becomes a critical area of focus. I know Dr. Jacob is all over that as well. So we share his interest in that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : So I guess, just -- I kind of had the same question was just -- would you given that -- this is now scheduled with Bechtel for the rebaseline et cetera. Do you feel like the staff report this time will be a little more kind of aligned with your update whereas in the past, it's been a little bit more skeptical, and just as we kind prep to see what they say in July? Thomas Fanning : I never want to get ahead of the staff and what they're going to say due is. I think everybody is a little bit of the broad statement. Most people would be very pleased with our progress on construction and productive hours work per week. And our ability to hit milestones has been really good since we've taken over the project, really since last July anyway. So I think that kind of is uniform. I think now people are really focused. As I just said with Angie, this notion of milestone achievement and turnover from construction to startup is a big issue. That's why, in fact, in the materials we provided you guys the slides, et cetera, we really did put more out there about what we expect, what the margins are for these major milestones? I think that is probably going to be where you get a lot of conversations. Steve Fleishman : On that topic, just how well prepared is the NRC for that kind of stage? Thomas Fanning : I think, really good. In fact, I could give a report, in the past we have always -- not always, but in the past, we've talked a lot about ITAAC, remember that integrated tests that once achieved, will allow us to move to fuel load. So that's really critical stuff. And you know we've really worked constructively with the NRC to get the right testing regime in place to be able us to go hard on-site. I can just tell you our progress there is good. I used to hold that out as one of the issues we were particularly worried about. I haven't talked a lot about it so much lately because I feel like we're just making a lot of good progress. Just though, you know, let's say as a year-end, we will have 200 ITAACs left for free. You remember we started at around 850. We moved that number down cooperatively with the NRC to 450. And we're moving through issues this year. So by the end of this year, we'll think we'll have everything but about 200 left for Unit 3. I've visited with each of the NRC commissioners personally along with our team here. I think everybody realizes, everybody at the federal government level whether it's the United States cabinet, Congress, the NRC, how strategically important this is for the United States of America to succeed. So we're getting all the resources and cooperation we made in order to be successful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, Tom, maybe then to just continue with the focus on Vogtle here, if I can. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that higher ramping of the 160,000 as you talk about? I just want to get a little bit more of a sense of, again, where we get into workers? Is this included Canada? And how do you see that today given all the talk and focus on worker ramp that we had in the last year? Maybe we'll start there? Thomas Fanning : You bet. A problem that we were intensely focused on, say last year, seems to be getting under control. And that was we talked a lot last year about the ability for us to resource skilled electrical workers, particularly pipe fitters, secondly, on-site. You may remember we moved to top decile compensation. We've had terrific compensation from the building trades. And we have more than accomplished all of the resource requirements we need. And in fact, in the last earnings call, we essentially have a waiting list of backlog of people that want to come work to the site. So that's how we achieved. If you remember, we set the target of hitting 140,000 hours per week, kind of end of March into April, we'll sure enough we did it sooner. We've talked about that a bit. We feel very comfortable. And we did all of that without Canada, okay? We feel very comfortable in our position right now. When we reevaluated the cost and schedule relationship and the baseline effort, and it's moved to 160. We did so with confidence that we could hit the staffing levels. And secondly, now we're going to need to add more supervisory personnel. I know a question that would come to your mind and has been in our mind is, oh, when you're adding people, you're going to be less efficient. You should know that most of these additions now to move from 140 up to 160, on the average over this smaller eight months period. We'll be done largely on the second shift. If you look at work, deployment so far, we've earned ours roughly 70% on the first shift, 30% on the second shift. We're going to tilt more into the second shift. It will go to the 70-30, it will be 60-40, 55-45. And of course, it will vary for some weeks. And this is -- we call also a ramp up into say August-September timeframe. So we have the ability to bring people on site in a very kind of prudent way, train them, and will have the right folks in place. I guess the good news is that we've gained a lot of confidence in our ability to resource personnel and some managed to work. We feel very confident about moving to the 160. And that gave us the ability to think about resequencing some work and doing some other things that provided us with this new rebaseline schedule. One other thing you just should know, I think, it's an important frame of reference. We actually argued here about whether we should put this in the script or not. So we gave you a baseline -- bookings. That's said, if we hit 100,000 hours per week, we can hit kind of our November schedule, and the 160 allows us to hit the aggressive schedule. If you want to another number, it is a reasonably linear relationship working about 130,000 hours per week. So that's kind of what we've done this year so far allows us to achieve kind of July, maybe August schedule. So we're feeling pretty good right now. Of course, there is a boatload of work to do, a ton of attention that needs to be paid, continued focus on efficiency, but we're feeling pretty good. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Where the July, August was relative to November in-service, right? That's what you're saying? Thomas Fanning : Yes. Always compare everything to November. That is our target. So if we beat November, there will be tick-or-tape parade. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then just a quick clarification on your commentary earlier with respect to Greg, are there any other asset sales assumed in the plan relative to the $2.5 billion of equity? And then secondly, if you can just, on electric sales, I know that you've commented a little bit on whether adjusted trends. It doesn't change anything around earnings expectations for the year. Does it? Thomas Fanning : Well, yes, I'll do a first shot, and Drew kind of follow-up here. Look, there's nothing substantive in terms of asset sales for the rest of the year. We would only do that on an opportunistic basis. I think both of these deals have been great. Between those two deals as well, $1.1 billion? Andrew Evans : That's right. Thomas Fanning : So all of that help, we\u2019ve been -- all that help with respect to kind of where we're sourcing equity and everything else. Andrew Evans : I think, well, you've described it exactly right. Nacogdoches in itself was not particularly in our plan. It does have a general downward bias in our equity needs. I think that both, remember, that both of these transactions are effectively used to repay indebtedness in total, and then ultimately reduce what we have to draw in terms of shares in the grip. And so we're always going to look for opportunities to shorten the length of the grip program, but nothing is planned in the -- nothing is within the plan today that would require additional sale of assets. The other question Julien that you asked was related to sales. It was a rather warm quarter down here. And so second warmest in 20 years. We had good cost control over the period that allowed us to meet the estimates that we provided to you, and for budgets that we provided to ourselves internally. There are certainly limits to the ability to reduce expenses. We are certainly still sensitive to weather. And so, we'll just have to sort of standby to see how the summer goes. But I don't think that these two things are necessarily or naturally correlated. And so I don't have any discomfort with our ability to meet our guidance range for the year. Thomas Fanning : Hey Drew, wasn't it about $0.08 compared to normal on weather? Andrew Evans : That's right. Thomas Fanning : So you think about it. We hit the estimate that we gave you last time with $0.08 of headwinds. So I feel pretty good about it also. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Michael Weinstein : My question is about Unit 4. I think you said that earlier that Unit 4, there might -- you might be considering the rebaselining at some point. I'm wondering is that you're -- if you're kind of indicating that, you might be willing or contemplating pulling workers off Unit 4 to ramp up on Unit 3 if necessary? Thomas Fanning : Yes. Thank you for that question. I didn't say I was considering it. Somebody asked me, would -- I guess it was filling out the question. What we will be thinking about going forward? Unit 3 feels pretty good. The rebaseline should be good for Unit 3. We'll evaluate Unit 4. Our general thrust is that Unit 4 is a year behind Unit 3. And that's staged on a variety of metrics and the best way to employ personnel on the site and a variety of other things. In my opinion, Unit 4 should be a carbon copy of Unit 3. And what we have consistently found is that when we learn on Unit 3, it accrues to the benefit of Unit 4. And so in general, I can't promise this. I am not promising this. But in general, our experience has been Unit 4 performance is better than Unit 3. So there might be a chance to improve the scheduling for. I'm not promising that. I'm just telling you that the potential. Michael Weinstein : Is part of the plan to ramp up on -- to 160 that you might -- you might pull people up to Unit 4 in order to make sure the Unit 3 comes in on time? Thomas Fanning : You shouldn't think about it that way. We are optimizing Unit 3, and we are optimizing Unit 4. It is exactly a 1,200 difference between the two. We're not going to cannibalize it. That's the kind of characterization you want to make between the two units. But you should know, again, as we re-optimize every week for heaven sake, we always evaluate the best resource, the best allocation of personnel. If there was a short-term issue that arises, sure, we could take advantage of it. But in general, both units are going fine. Andrew Evans : And I hope it's clear that those -- hours work per week represents total production, total construction of the site, so 160 is both Units 3 and 4. Thomas Fanning : That's right. Andrew Evans : But here's the thing. We are so focused on getting Unit 3 to completion, and getting Unit 3 to fuel load. And I think our metrics show that we can do that. We are working like dogs and make sure it happen. Michael Weinstein : Got you. Thomas Fanning : The rebaseline effort did include both units, right? Michael Weinstein : Right. Okay. Thank you. Thomas Fanning : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Praful Mehta : I guess first question was on testing. And just wanted to understand how much testing has been done so far in terms of the equipment that's lined there? And what have been the most recent results around the testing phase that would give us any color around how we think the process is going? Thomas Fanning : Yes. So what's interesting is by year end -- so some testing has occurred. And I think, I even suggested in prior calls that the turnover of some of the very first systems, the first two or three that we did were not done the way we wanted them to be done. We hadn\u2019t really focused on the right processes in place and everything else. And so we've really turned our focus now, of course, we're focused on schedule. But this idea of moving from construction and service and the testing regimes in place, we've really kind of tighten the screws on that. Lately, we've had good experience. By year end, we expect to have 45 of the 95 total systems for Unit 3 complete. Right now, when you think about both systems, both Unit 3 and Unit 4 were about 12% of our testing is complete. So we already have started. So what you're seeing right now is that whatever you want to call, the waterfall curve, the ramp up, whatever. And that's why we're giving a lot of emphasis to these milestones. This is, I think, one of the big focus areas for you and us, for '19 and '20, as we move to completion of construction and fuel load in this whole turnover and testing system. Praful Mehta : And so, in your mind, as you look at this testing phase, where are the areas where you think testing could show up with issues of concerns or which other sites or which other, I think testing spots that, I guess, a critical path from your perspective? Any particular one that we should be looking out for? Thomas Fanning : Yes, sir. On the slides that we've provided you, I guess that Page 7 in the slide. We've given you -- and we really argued a lot about how to do this most effectively. But there are seven big milestones remaining, okay. We did this just for Unit 3. If you want to go to Unit 4, take these dates and add 12 months, okay. So interestingly, initial energization was a milestone that's really important. But it was established back in June of '18. And sure enough we did it. Now we haven't finished it, but we're right on schedule. We feel good. That's why it has a start. And then as you move forward, the start of the integrated flush, we have a timeframe there kind of summer into fall when we want to start that effort. That's going to be moving water through the pipe systems and cleaning out everything for the plan is going to shape as it needs to be when we turn it over for testing. Once we get them the main control room ready, okay, so that now we've connected all the wires. Now that sounds like a simple thing, but if you could imagine, a lot of the electrical work that we are dealing with involves connecting A to B in the plan. When I push a button or throw a switch that it has an effect elsewhere in the plan. Getting the main control room ready settings, we've done all the electrical work we need to do to basically run the plan from the control room, big deal. Then we move it. And I should say for the first three milestones, of course, we've already done initial energization. But for milestones two and three, we have some flexibility and how to move those through time. Now let's go to the other big three. Start coal, hydro testing is a big deal. The hot functional testing is essentially signifying that construction is substantially complete. You will see the hours work from our Bechtel partners really fall off, once we complete our hot functional tests. What's remaining there are essentially all of the final testing items, ITAAC completion, everything else that leads to fuel load. Once we get the fuel load, man, we have gone hot on the system. We have six months allowed between fuel load and in-service. Frankly, China did it in less than six months. We think we could probably beat that or do it or better or whatever, but we're still allowing in the scheduled six months, and then in-service. Those are the steps. We think within those seven, there are frankly hundreds of startup tests that we will be doing. But identifying in these major milestone components, we thought was the most effective way to communicate with you and frankly with our regulator. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Ali Agha : First question, I just wanted to clarify. So as on Vogtle, as you're looking at these milestones and going through your targeted productivities et cetera, what's the biggest bottleneck right now that you see out there? Thomas Fanning : That's a wonderful question. Look, I would go to something that we always see. Now we've been good at it so far -- because we've been good at it, I don't want to say it's a walkover, but, getting people on-site, getting them trained and getting a productive on the workplace. And we're going to put most of these people on the second shift as I suggested moving from a relationship of 70-30 to 60-40, 55-45 is a big deal. When you think about rebaselining, we were very gratified with kind of actually a small reduction in hours on the electrical work. Still, I would argue the electrical work to be performed in these confined spaces is the most challenging work we do. So that is kind of the issue. It remains our critical path. And I think the reason -- one of the reasons why we felt more confident now, finishing rebaselining about November is that our critical path actually got improved the rebase as a result of the rebaselining, but it remains critical path. One other point, even though we -- when you add people, we worry about so many people being crowded in the containment area and all that and loss of productivity. Well, we're going to move into second shift, so you should lessen that problem a bit. We're going to need to bring more supervisory personnel. Now those are backfill people. Like, I say, I communicate with my friend Brendan Bechtel roughly every two weeks, Jack Futcher, one of their great leaders has been on-site so much Bart, Brian, all the people on that team do a hell of a job working with us in a great partnership to get this stuff done. I will say however, executing effective supervisory oversight of more people is not a slam dunk. So we should just continue to have intense focus on that. So if I had to say just this last thing, wingspan. We're increasing our bandwidth. I don't know, however, you want to call it. Moving from the 140, we just did, I think 143 last week. Moving from the 140 to 160 on the average in an 8 months timeframe, we think is doable, but it will require more resources. It will require more effective supervision to stay productive. That's probably is our big deal. Ali Agha : Second question. I wanted to also clarify on when you all talk about quarterly outlook, you tend to give us a single point estimates like you just did for the second quarter, you gave us for the first quarter as well. But for the year you've got the range out there. So when you're looking at the single point estimates, I just wanted to be clear that that sort of target the midpoint of the range or the high-end, what's the relationship between those single point quarterly estimates and the full-year guidance you layout for us? Thomas Fanning : Hey, Ali, I'm going to turn this over to Drew. I'll quit talking. But I do want to say you hit it exactly right. When we hit quarterly estimates, they are, in fact, estimates. It's not new guidance, okay? Guidance for us is the range. So when we give you an estimate, that's just the best of our ability. Drew working with the CFO, and working with the operations people, in fact, all it is, right? We feel very confident about the range. The range is structured with the midpoint being our expected value. But I can tell you we have intense efforts here to beat our expected value. Andrew Evans : Not a lot to add. When we set estimates for the quarter to come, we're trying to give you an indication of where we think we're going to come out. Based on economic conditions, our goal is to target something that would produce a mid range result for year-end. It's easier for us to provide first and second as we sort of move through it. Third quarter is certainly the largest quarter in contribution to our annual earnings, and so probably has the most range around it. But generally Ali, we're trying to target what would be middle of range. If we get to a point, I think we've been running a little bit higher in the range as we did at the beginning of last year, which had a relatively, well, significantly colder start than this year. We were able to move guidance up, I think quite a bit earlier in the year last year. Thomas Fanning : Yes. And other than institutional knowledge here, the only time, I think that we have commented on our range and change it was last year, at least in my experience now that goes back 20 years in various roles here even as CFO. We typically only readdress guidance at the end of the third quarter, which is our October call. That\u2019s because we've got through a high revenue quarter this summer. But we push like crazy to get higher in the range. If you look at our track record, we typically do really well within the range. But from a FD standpoint, all we have is a range right now. Ali Agha : Lastly, Tom, just remind us when does the Georgia Commission look at the cost -- overall cost impudency of Vogtle? Is it after Unit 3 comes online or is it after both units come online? Can just remind us? Thomas Fanning : Yes. Well, so we have the VCM processes that undergo every six months. And then I think a process will begin on Unit 1, I mean, I'm sorry, on Unit 4 fuel load. So the date that is expected to be on the November schedule is -- let me see if I can find it, April 2021 Andrew Evans : April 2022. Thomas Fanning : 2022. April 2022 would be the kind of initiation of that. Ali Agha : Thanks so much. Thomas Fanning : But, yes, I just want to add for clarity. These VCMs are very helpful along the way. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Arnold : Just a quick question and I missed some of the calls. I apologies if you answered this already. But has there been any change in the contingency that you are factoring in on Vogtle as part of the rebaseline or anything to report that? Thomas Fanning : No. The contingency remains, I think, from 100% dollars around $800 million. And we have not used any of it to date. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides : I want to change the topic a little bit. You touched some on the 2 gigawatts of coal retirements. Can you talk about : a) when those units go off line? And b) how you're looking at the fleet over the next, I don't know, three to five years whether you see another kind of -- another round of coal retirement coming? And how you might replace that capacity if you need to replace that capacity? Thomas Fanning : Well, so it's very interesting stuff there. Gosh, even in response to the Clean Power Plan, actually, before the Clean Power Plan was put forth by EPA, we started thinking about -- I can remember we had a daylong meeting in DC about this, about what we came to call a better way that is a way to think about rationally transitioning the generation fleet so that we preserve for the benefit of customers the best balance of clean, safe, reliable, affordable. Essentially, we've been executing on that plan. And the only change I would say is with the continued benefits of the revolution that has been directional drilling and cheap plant fuel gas prices, that retirement has been accelerated. So I would say that has been a factor. The other big factor has been greater penetration of renewables in our system, particularly in Georgia, to a lesser extent in Alabama. One more factor that's very interesting. Georgia is going through its IRP, and we don't want to front run that process. So all of these decisions -- there maybe an overlay of a strategy that carries us through to 2015, and frankly, we have to take into account the diminishment of total resources. If you're going to keep coal alive, it must have carbon capture technology on it. We continue to invest in the R&D for those solutions. But in general, you need to think about coal going down over time, natural gas staying in its place, more renewables, nuclear being preserved. So this nuclear will complete Vogtle 3 and 4. We'll complete one phase of that. Probably in the 2030s to 40s, we'll think about the so called Gen 4 reactors. I think if we are serious about carbon, we do need as a nation to continue to invest in nuclear technology. But for us, that won't be for my administration call. That's going to be for two or three down the road, but you will be in the 30 to 40, where I think we need to add more news. The other thing that's just kind of interesting here, there could be more acceleration of this transition. I think it's going to be key by the various things that we are working on in a rather unique way. There's so much rhetoric out there about storage technology and about carbon capture. The only people that are really investing, I wouldn't say only, but in our industry, we by far lead in proprietary, robust, research and development. We're the biggest funder of APRI. Dr. Steven Specker is on our board. Frankly, he's the Lead Director. Ernie Moniz is on our board. We are the guys that really are putting our money forward to create these solutions. And we don't rely on just rhetoric to see all this stuff happen. We're trying to invent the future. One last point, there is a change in this 100-year old business model, where we had created a very small, but very important option. And that is the miniaturization, if you will, of making, moving and selling energy away from central-station approaches to so called micro grids, where on commercial and industrial customer's location they may have make, move and sell characteristic. Our subsidiary PowerSecure, now aligning very closely with Southern Power, and perhaps another subsidiary we have the fuel management Sequent, are really working to advance this idea. We had deployed. Southern Company has deployed now with PowerSecure, 85% of the nation's micro grids. So if that kind of different business model starts to take hold that will have an effect on the transition of the generating fleet in America, and may help accelerate it. So, sorry of a long-winded answer. Except to say shorthand, we have a big strategy in place. We have an important option on thinking about the change in the business model. We have important investments in items that will have some effect on the speed of that transition. Ultimately, tactically, these are decisions that must be made by our states. Michael Lapides : Hey, Tom, one quick follow up. Do you see potential in the next couple of years, 3 to 5 years, but especially, given kind of the PPC, ITC benefits that change overtime for significant renewable rollout in outside of Georgia meaning maybe Alabama, maybe Mississippi? Or do you think that's more longer-dated? Thomas Fanning : I don't know. Listen, I think both in Alabama and in Mississippi, those commissions are actively considering the attractiveness of all sources of generation. They -- if you look back at any of our commissions, they have a terrific track record of being innovative, creative, and really doing things for the benefit of customers. They don't get augmented on any particular issue of clean, safe, reliable, affordable. I think they do a terrific job of balancing those issues. So certainly, we will consider those things in the next three to five years. One other area of particular emphasis is the military. You may know that I think, anyway, I've been appointed to the Solarium Commission. My appointment was put forth by Mitch McConnell. And I think I'm either the one or two only private citizens that -- I know that's kind of a weird description, other than, say, military personnel or congressional personnel. Speaking about the next future military doctor, and that DoD will go forward with. Part of that military doctor and is tied up in, how do they think about operating in a digital or cyber environment, okay? Part of that will go to the resilience in their own energy operations. So there are cyber wars or kinetic wars. How do they think about their own ability to maintain their capability to listen, to learn and to fight back? That has a distinct bearing on the advancement of our thinking of micro grids and distributed infrastructure, certainly in the Southeast and the rest of United States. So we're participating not only an insight currently, but in creating military doctor in the future. You may see the military as an early adopter of some of these concepts. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Weinstein : Hey, guys, quick follow-up. Back on Vogtle, maybe, could you just explain how the costs are increasing despite the heavy ramp up in workers over the summer and throughout the next eight months after that? Thomas Fanning : I'm sorry. Give me a little more there. What are you looking for? Michael Weinstein : Yes. How are you keeping the costs, estimates of the project unchanged despite the ramp up in work levels? Thomas Fanning : Okay. So remember, ramp up in work levels is designed to accomplish the same amount of work in a different time frame. In other words, so if we say November '21, '22, and we have a schedule that is also associated with I mean, a cost schedule, a budget, this is what November '21, '22. Just because we're changing workflows, we're not changing the amount of hours, and in fact, from the rebaseline, the amount of hours actually reduced a bit, little over 500,000 hours in total. So costs estimate within that. So whether we ramp up from 140 to 160, I refer to the shape that is only for an eight months period. And we've considered kind of a balance of costs and scheduling in creating that shape. I think they are very consistent. There is no -- where you might see a problem in cost is if we try to say, let's go to 300,000 hours per week, where you would flood the people, you would flood the site with people, you would have tremendous inefficiency. The way we try to get this fuel efficiency concept is with our CPI statistics. So I think the most recent CPI statistics, last week, we did 143,000 hours at 1.11, I think. I think what we're showing you cumulative CPI 1.16. What that basically says is its 1.16 cost to deliver one hour effective performance. We try to give you a baseline to measure that against the total budget. So as long as we say below 1.4, then we're staying within our total cost estimates. So that's kind of way you should think about it. So when you said how are we managing costs and increasing in hours, we just changed the shape of the work. The work actually went down a wee bit, and we still think we're able to hit November with some margin right now. Our cost estimates are still well below the 1.4, and therefore we're still within the total budget for costs. Michael Weinstein : So I mean, essentially, what you're saying is, you don't expect that hiring is going to be an issue. The cost of labor is not going to be higher to attract that more workers besides for a second shift, right? Thomas Fanning : Yes, we've already incorporated. If you recall, when we went to top-decile pay, if I remember the numbers correctly, that was an $80 million kind of number. And that's a reasonable estimate. We handle that with other work that we picked up. And so we manage that without hitting contingency. We've managed that cost element. Within this current estimate, of course, we'll see. But we think we're okay. When we re-estimated -- one more point, when we re-estimated last July, we took all this into account as well. Michael Weinstein : Right. Okay. Thanks very much. Thomas Fanning : Yes. I hope that you got it. If you didn't, please call us back. Michael Weinstein : We'll do. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Fanning, are there any closing remarks for today? Thomas Fanning : Well, as always, we never say thank you enough, and while I thank you all for following Southern Company. This is a nationally important issue when you think about the importance of Vogtle 3 and 4. I really feel compelled with the value of Southern Company right now when you look at PE ratios and a variety of other things. As we continue to execute on Vogtle the way we have, and, of course, there is a lot of hard work to do. But my sense is the rest of the business at Vogtle 3 and 4, has been doing great. Thousands of people making thousands of great decisions we continue to perform over and over and over. As we continue to execute on Vogtle 3 and 4, my sense is on a risk adjusted basis. This is terrific a investment. We appreciate your interest in our company. We'll continue to work as hard as we can to follow through on these big objectives. Thanks everybody. See you soon. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company first quarter 2019 earnings call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Ciglan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thanks, Ciglan. Good morning, and welcome to Southern Company's second quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Scott. Good morning. And thank you all for joining us. This morning, we reported strong earnings per share substantially above our estimate and remain on track to meet our full year earnings target for 2019. Our electric system has demonstrated resilience in what has so far been a hot summer in the southeast. We also continue to make meaningful progress at Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 as demonstrated by the achievement of several milestones during the quarter. In addition, we are progressing well through an active regulatory calendar this year. We\u2019ll cover all of this today. So let me start with an update on Vogtle. The site continues to make progress and we remain focused on meeting the November 21 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service date for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Our strategy of working to an aggressive plan on the site remains in place and currently provides a six month margin to the November date. There is no change in our total estimated costs for the project at this time. And we have not allocated any contingency, though the presence of a contingency reflects our expectation that we will likely utilize this reserve in the months ahead. As we stated during the first quarter call, our focus is on achievement of major milestones, supported by adequate staffing and productivity. In May, we achieved initial energization for Unit 3, a major milestone for the project. In addition, we set the middle containment ring for Unit 4 and installed the generator rotor for Unit 3. In August, we expect to begin our next major milestone for Unit 3, integrated flush activities on schedule with the site's aggressive work plan. Overall and including engineering procurement and initial test plan activities, the entire project is approximately 79% complete. For Unit 3 direct construction is 71% complete with a target to approach 90% by year end. The site is averaged approximately 145,000 earned hours over the past three weeks with a year-to-date average of 133,000 earned hours through July. Now recall, the aggressive site work plan requires an average of 160,000 weekly earned hours for a sustained period of time starting later this year into next year. To meet the regulatory approved November schedule, we estimate that we would need to average approximately 100,000 earned hours per week through the start of Unit 3 hot functional testing, which is essentially the completion of the construction phase for the unit. We've been successful in hiring additional craft resources and supervision and now we have over 8,000 people working on the site across day and night shifts. As a result of these hiring efforts constructions weekly production capacity has risen and we are working to gain productivity improvement. As we [Technical Difficulty], for example most recently our electrical scope for Unit 3, we see essentially an S-curve or a sawtooth effect. As we add a significant number of new skilled craft and field supervision, we initially see modest levels of improvement in earned hours then as the workforce matures productivity should improve. You can see this effect in our most recent data. CPI is a trailing four-week statistic. However over the last month or so earned hours for our Unit 3 electrical have more than doubled. Looking forward in order to meet the aggressive site work plan we will need to sustain and improve this performance. As a final note, it would not be surprising to see more fluctuations in CPI in the months ahead as we continue to add new craft and increase system turnover activities. We believe we are on track to meet the upcoming milestones in support of the aggressive site floor plan. Now looking forward to the end of the year, we expect to be near completion of the integrated flush for Unit 3 and have the main control room ready for testing. Around the same time, the site should begin open vessel testing, which we have added to Slide 7 as another major milestone to track. Open vessel testing verifies that water flows between the primary systems and the reactor and that the pumps, motors, valve and pipes function as designed. This is a key set of activities leading up to cold hydro testing which we anticipate will begin next spring. The final major construction milestone is the start of hot functional testing. From there we will focus primarily on certifying systems, leading up to fuel load which would occur by the end of next year under the aggressive site work plan. And as we said previously, the aggressive site work plan is challenging and we work to meet it every day. Ultimately success is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online on or before the regulatory approved November 2021 and 2022 in-service dates. Based on what we know today, we continue to expect that we have sufficient schedule and cost contingency to meet this objective. I'll now turn the call over to Drew to cover our quarterly performance in greater detail. Andrew Evans : Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Happy Shark Week. In the second quarter of 2019 we achieved earnings per share of $0.80 on an adjusted basis, $0.09 higher than the estimate we provided on our last call and in line with $0.80 of earnings per share on an adjusted basis reported in the second quarter of 2018. The primary drivers of our quarterly results compared to last year are higher revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing, net of usage changes and warmer than normal weather at our regulated utilities, partially offset by the impact on earnings as a result of divestitures. Temperatures across our Southeast service territory were significantly warmer than normal during the second quarter of 2019, including the warmest May in the last 50 years, resulting in $0.03 of benefit compared to last year and $0.07 of benefit versus normal. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and the earnings package. Taking a look at customer growth. We added nearly 23,000 residential electric customers and over 14,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities in the first half of the year. These additions put us on track to meet our full year expectations for residential customer gains across our electric and gas franchises and are comparable to the growth we experienced in the same period last year. Customer growth continues to be driven primarily by strong job growth and population growth in our Southeast service territories. Weather adjusted retail electric sales were down just over 1% year-over-year due to a combination of factors, including continued energy efficiency and technology advances across all customer segments and continued weakness in industrial sales. Industrial sales particularly primary metals, chemicals and stone, clay and glass were down due to global trade concerns and a strong dollar's impact on trade, as well as changes in production levels and some timing. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share were a $1.50 in 2009 with essentially no weather impact. To be clear, weather on an aggregate basis has been normal for the year despite the warmer than normal second quarter period. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2019 is a $1.10 per share on adjusted basis with normal weather. We will assess our earnings guidance range for the full year after the third quarter. Turning now to some updates on capital requirements. In June Southern Power successfully closed on its sale of the Nacogdoches Generating Facility to Austin Energy for $460 million. The sale of Plant Mankato to Xcel remains subject to Minnesota and North Dakota State Commission approvals and is expected to close this fall. Year-to-date equity issuances from internal plans have resulted in proceeds of approximately $450 million which is higher than forecasted. Southern's equity needs for 2023 now stands at roughly $2 billion. While we have the capacity to fill our projected equity needs through our robust internal equity plans, we continue to evaluate all options to efficiently source equity. Financial stability and strong credit metrics provide significant benefits to our customers and investors and remain a top priority for us. Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I'd like to give a brief update on our regulatory calendar for the remainder of the year. As we get [Technical Difficulty] to Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Power filed base rate cases with the Georgia Public Service Commission in June, we expect that these Georgia proceedings, as well as the pending rate case for Nicor Gas in Illinois to conclude in late 2019. Mississippi Power is scheduled to file a base rate case with the Mississippi Public Service Commission in the fourth quarter of 2019. Lastly Georgia Power received a final ruling earlier in July on its Integrated Resource Plan and Tom will highlight a few of the outcomes in that proceeding. Tom, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Tom Fanning Thanks, Drew. As Drew mentioned earlier this month the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Powers 2019 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP in a 5-0 vote. Recall, Georgia Power files an IRP every three years and the improved plan outlines how the company will continue to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to 2.6 million customers over the next 20 years. The approved plan includes the addition of 2,260 megawatts of new renewable generation and the retirement of five - coal fired generation units totaling nearly 1,000 megawatts. As a result, the Georgia Power intends to grow its renewable generation portfolio by more than 72% to nearly 5,400 megawatts by 2024 increasing the company's total renewable capacity to 22%. Georgia Power also received approval to own and operate 80 megawatts of battery energy storage systems which will help position the company as a leader in energy storage. In addition, Georgia Powers environmental compliance strategy was approved, including plans to close all 29 ash ponds. We believe these are constructive outcome that will benefit our customers on many levels in the years ahead. In closing, I'd like to highlight a few newsworthy items of which we\u2019re particularly proud. For the third year in a row, Georgia Power was ranked number one for customer satisfaction among large utilities in the south by J.D. Power in its 2019 Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study. Georgia Power achieved the highest score in its category based on multiple factors, including reliability, corporate citizenship, communications and customer service. Two of our natural gas utilities, Virginia Natural Gas and Chattanooga Gas were recently recognized as most trusted business partners in the utility industry by Cogent Syndicated and the alliance to save energy named Alabama Power as the 2019 star of efficiency for its smart neighborhood project outside of Birmingham. In addition for the fourth consecutive year Southern Company was named among the top 50 companies for diversity by DiversityInc. Our long standing commitment to diversity and inclusion is embedded in our culture and allows us to better anticipate change and achieve success as we build the future of energy. I'm very proud of our team for these accomplishments. Again, we are very pleased with our performance from both a financial and operational perspective. Through the first half of the year, we continue to see our regulated franchises operating on a high level and we are achieving key milestones in Vogtle. We remain focused on bringing Unit 3 and 4 online by their regulatory approved date of November 2021 and November 2022. We are committed to keeping you informed and look forward to providing another in-depth update at the end of the third quarter. So thank you for joining us this morning. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Greg. Greg Gordon : Morning, Tom. A couple of questions. Congratulations on continuing to see the type of productivity improvements that you need to be within the now sort of April to November timeframe in - on the Vogtle project. Can you can you comment. I know it only just came out in the last 24 to 36 hours on why you think the staff of the Georgia Commission in their review of your last filing is more sceptical of your ability to execute and where the dissonance might be between your cautious optimism and their scepticism? Tom Fanning : Yeah, sure. Glad to do that. First of all, I think - I think it was reasonably a fair report. We respect those folks and you should know, everybody on the phone should know that the people that write that report, whether it's Dr. Jacobs or other key members of the staff sit in every meeting that we sit in virtually. So they're in the co-owners meetings and they're in there with Southern Nuclear management, with Bechtel, with me and Paul Bowers and Drew and all the team. So number one, all the cards are on the table for everybody. Number two, I think one of the other important paragraphs you should read in that report is the first paragraph. And that's a very I think positive statement about the process that we're going through. I think the third point is we certainly respect these people and they are certainly confident. But where we would find differences of opinion would really go to our belief in our own capability, when you think about the players I just mentioned, whether it is our own team building the plant, led by Glen Chick, who came from Browns Ferry that put a - completed a nuclear plant and know how to do this. That's the most recent example; our own expertise and look at the track record of success that we've been able to show since we took over the project from Westinghouse; look at Bechtel, they are by far the leading contractor for nuclear plants around the world. And you know I have a great relationship with Brendan Bechtel. In fact, weekend or two ago I was with not only Brendan but his dad Riley. The team on site there, look I think we know how to build nuclear plants and I think there are certainly different approaches you could take, but we believe that our approach has been tested recently, not only at Browns Ferry but also in China and that we think everything we're doing is sound. There are no secrets, there's no hidden cards. Everything that we're doing is open for discussion and it's not only us, its our co-owners and anybody - oh the NRC and everybody that looked in believes that our practices are sound. It's very reasonable that somebody could have a different opinion about that, but we believe that our conviction is well suited. So I would say those general comments. I would say just other things that are important. And it really goes to how you look at the data. I spent a little bit of time in the script talking about this sawtooth or ramp up of effect. We believe that we are reasonably on track to do what we need to do on electrical work front. It did start a little slower than probably we wanted, but that's not completely unexpected. Bechtel would describe that as their S-curve we call it sawtooth. But we believe now we're hitting the numbers we need to hit in terms of the electrical work front and if we sustain that and then we want to improve it a little better, we believe that we're reasonably on track to do it. We need to do to hit the schedule. And so far the milestones are reflective of the aggressive site plan. We readily admit, the aggressive site plan is in fact aggressive, okay. But every time we beat 100,000 hours or every time we beat - we achieve a milestone consistent with the aggressive plan we build and maintain margin to the November in-service date and that is ultimately success. Greg I'm glad to go into anything further you'd like to, but I think those\u2026 Greg Gordon : Not that\u2019s extremely thorough. I appreciate it. Two more quick questions. One is just in the quarter you know, you\u2019ve said that you had you know, that the hottest May in 50 years. And I know you said on a year-to-date basis things have sort of evened out. But can you suss out how much usage and how much - how much of the - how much of the incremental earnings in the quarter whether it was usage or directly weather driven came from that weather event or is it sort of\u2026 Tom Fanning : Sure\u2026 Greg Gordon : [indiscernible] clear that you were able to carve that out? Andrew Evans : Yeah, Greg. This is Drew. We actually put it in Slide 9, but the weather impact for the second quarter was about $0.03 relative to last year and about $0.07 relative to normal. But if you look at it over the course of the entire year, I think weather is actually down about a penny relative to our normal expectations for consumption. As we look at the individual usage classes, you know, conservation and energy efficiency are pervasive trends particularly in residential and commercial and then on the industrial side, we did see a downtick of about 2% in total electricity sales. We think a good portion of it just really describes a general economy that's in a bit of a pause. Trade skirmishes are sort of a vacuum to good capital deployment or a barrier to good capital deployment over the long term and a strong dollar in general with an economy that's about 25% dependent upon exports for its production really just signaled to us that we're seeing a little bit of weakening and that's \u2013 in that section of the economy. Tom Fanning : Hey, Greg. Let me jump in here real quick. Let me correct them, I had a brain cramp. I don't know why, I was in a conversation this morning kind of getting ready for CNBC. I had Browns Ferry on my mind on another issue, the last completed one was Watts Bar. So anyway\u2026 Greg Gordon : I don't think anybody would have caught that. But thank you. Tom Fanning : Yeah. You bet\u2026 Greg Gordon : Have a great morning, guys. Tom Fanning : Yeah. Thank you, buddy. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes one of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey. Good morning. Andrew Evans : Julien, thanks for joining us. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, thank you rather. Hey listen, I wanted to follow up a little bit on Greg's question if you could elaborate a little bit. I mean, clearly both you and staff talk about potentially - shall we say using up some of that contingency. Where and how would you kind of read into progress against that and confidence or really what variables or specific elements are going to be eating into that contingency. Is there any difference in opinion between you and staff on where you might be using that contingency or where the greatest risks are to that specific element? Then I got a follow up. Tom Fanning : Yeah. Well, I mean, let me just start with the basic concept right? When we created the new estimate July a year ago, we put everything that we knew into the estimate and then we said let's create a contingency of some percent above that estimate. And the contingency basically allows for things that you don't know in the current period if you have a reasonable expectation that you'll spend over time. To the extent we made the statement that we're not going to use contingency, we would have to reverse it. At this point we believe that for everything we know we think there is still a reasonable likelihood that we will use contingency. Otherwise we'd have to reverse it. We don't think we're in a position to reverse that today. Now, will we use contingency going forward? I think we probably will. That is the assessment that we must make in order to keep it on the books and keep it in place. Look we continually re-evaluate our cost position and we're very gratified as of the current period right now that we haven't touched contingency, we look at all the pluses and minuses. You must imagine that as a daily activity and we evaluate that against our own kind of reserves and our own kind of allowances for change. So far we've been able to manage any of the pluses and minuses with cost today and what we know in the future with our own reserves on site, but we haven't touched contingency. My only caution is to people don't be surprised if and when we do. And it may be kind of lumpy and maybe you know, 50 million to 100 million or 150 million, there's still three years to go on both these projects. My only caution to people is our contingency is there for a reason. Andrew Evans : And Julien, if I could sort of reintroduce a concept, that I have talked about a number of times and I think it's supported by the independent system monitors report. If we look at contingency as a percentage of our estimate to complete, we're maintaining a level that's perhaps in excess of 20% of that total estimate to complete. As Tom said, consumption of this in our view is probably certain the pace at which we do it is a little less certain. But nevertheless, if you measure us over a longer period of time, I think we'll take some great comfort in where we stand when we get to some point in the middle of next year. Tom Fanning : And contingency can take a lot of different forms right? But let's focus on Unit 3 for a minute here. We're about a year away, round numbers, maybe a little more, to hot functional test and what that says is your five or six month away from loading fuel. And then you're six months away from having an in-service. We are rapidly approaching, eliminating the uncertainties at least with respect to that unit, every month every quarter that we go by staying with schedule gives us more certainty that we'll be able to hit ultimately the November regulatory agreed upon process. So that's a big deal. And as you know, hot functional test is essentially the completion of construction. That's Unit 3. These things are happening right now. I think I've mentioned on TV that we announced yesterday that we've sent out a contract to procure fuel. So these times are fast approaching, whether we're going to use contingency or not at least on Unit 3 is right in front of us. So we are right now making a whole lot of progress. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Nice. If I can follow back up on the Georgia IRP process and just all together understanding the CapEx budget. I know you guys have historically done solar and sort of followed up after the fact and reflecting that in your outlook. But how do you think about the cadence of reflecting the latest IRP developments here and how do you think about your own participation in subsequent RFPs that will come out now? Tom Fanning : I'm sorry. Julien, what's the point of the question, is it how did we work with them on that, you want to me comment on that? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: How do you think about reflecting the CapEx benefits from any further generation procurement here from the IRP? Tom Fanning : I see what you're saying. Thank you. Yeah, we will - you know, as been our historical practice, we'll update CapEx probably the first - the end of the year call which will be end of January, 1st of February. So we're getting ready now. But I would argue that the direction of CapEx associate with this IRP approval is probably up when you consider the ARO associated with the ash ponds, when you consider kind of the storage project. You know, the swing in that when its obviously solar. If you remember last year, I don't think Georgia Power won any of the new solar, but Southern Power did. And then later Southern Power came in and bought a lot of the development activity by other successful bidders, that also can be a swing in what CapEx looks like down the road. But that's a little hard to predict today. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Look, I'm glad you brought it up actually. If I can clarify it. With respect to the ARO and the Georgia piece and obviously looking forward to Alabama, how much of that is already reflected just versus what's incremental here, specially the ARO piece? Tom Fanning : Yeah, if you look at the ARO it really is a 10 year obligation generally to make this environmental investment and about 40% of it is represented in our plan, something like that today, over the five year plan period. So if we look at the $38 billion that we think we will invest over the next five years, those investments are largely centered around modernization of the transmission distribution infrastructure and environmental - environmental investments. I think your question is more around the modernization of the generating fleet or the movement of - into renewable generation, which we kind of view as being a post 2023 issue - 2023 being the plan you're about to post, as a second half plan year that would give some durability to our growth rate and total invested capital in total rate base.\\ And there's some other kind of interesting ideas we introduced in the IRP that also could have a bearing here. One is that for the first time in my knowledge anyway in the history we had a section on resilience, and one of the ideas that we put in place is this notion of inactive reserve that is not retiring a coal plant per say, but taking it out of economic dispatch, preserving it as a matter of resilience in the event of a system emergency that could help in a whole variety of ways. Anyway, all those things have a bearing. We will certainly clarify that. But I - you know next year - but I think the general trend would be north of where we are. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. Got it. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you guys very much. Tom Fanning : Thank you my friend. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hello, Praful. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi. How are you doing? Tom Fanning : Terrific. Hope you're well? Praful Mehta : Excellent, excellent. So thank you for all the answers so far. I guess just to clarify, on the contingency that you highlighted just wanted to understand as you pointed out that you want to keep it on there as a justification for keeping it in the plan. Could you at least give some color on what specifically you have put against the contingency right now that allows you to keep it in the plan? Tom Fanning : It's just general uncertainty about the remaining work to be done and the schedule on part in which it will be done. You know, there's you know just to remind everybody to finish, I guess Unit 4 you're three years away, round number. So there is a lot that could happen between now and then. And I think the lack of - the lack of clarity with what could happen, you know in a hope, what are they call the unknown unknowns could certainly have a bearing. You should know also this is also a difference of opinion a little bit in the report by the staff. And that's perfectly fine. We keep a risk register. So what we do is we analyze the top you know, 10 kind of - it's actually bigger than that, but the top kind of 10 big things. And we like a subcontractor cost. And we look at how their performance has been with relation to construction startup testing. And we just continually reassess those. Its kinds of things that really go to our assessment about contingency. The other thing that you should know, I mean, think about as you go through testing, it may be that some of the equipment you test doesn't work the way it should and going to need to rework it or it could have a schedule impact or who knows. But that's the reason why there's just enough uncertainty remaining that we keep the contingency in place. We are gratified. Make no mistake, we haven't hit it yet. But don't be surprised if we do in the future. Praful Mehta : Got you. That\u2019s super helpful color. Understood. Maybe secondly on comparable plans in China. I know that there has been some unplanned outages there. Any color that you have in terms of what could be the reason for that. And is there any kind of design issue that you're aware of that could become a problem for Vogtle as well? Tom Fanning : Yeah, sure. Last question first. There is no design issue that we're aware of. Number two, there's been a lot of discussion about the RCP reactor coolant pump and you know, I think it's pretty clear the discussion around, we don't know the root cause effect. I think that reports coming out reasonably soon on site. But that really is a matter of discussion between the Chinese and Westinghouse. But that has been the only significant outage and our sense is that they have equipment on site that they could have improved the speed of the recovery or whatever. But for whatever reason that's really for them to answer. That's just one of 16 RCPs on site, there is no to our knowledge there is no design or systemic issue that we're aware of. Praful Mehta : Okay, great. Thanks and good to get that out of the way. So appreciate that. And then finally just quickly on the equity issuance timing, is there anything we should be thinking about around all the options and what are the options that you're thinking about and from a timing perspective how should we think about that as well? Tom Fanning : Probably I think we've shown really good discipline in terms of capital raising over the last year and a year and a half, probably two years. We've been focused on making sure that any divestiture that we do or slimming down of our core business is accretive to what our expectations are for equity. You know, you've seen some activity in this period in particular with the sale of Nacogdoches and I think our pending sale of Mankato. We've also done some streamlining across other parts of the business and recently sold the utility services business out of PowerSecure. We've discharged a very small container shipping lease program that was part of cleanup after the Nicore acquisition from 2011. So really working through all of the options that we have to reduce the burden on share issuance. The programs that we've had to date, the internal plans of drip generate about $500 million per annum and in share count the options exercise which is another component of an internal plan have accelerated a bit because of share price appreciation over the last few months. And so I'd just say that, as we look at all of the options available to us to satisfy the remaining $2 billion we just want to be as considerate from an investor perspective as we possibly can. Our route though is to meet our capital plan we can do it with simply using the internal plans that we have in place, all other options we would use would be only accretive to that plan. Praful Mehta : Got it. Super helpful, guys. Thanks so much. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Our following question concern line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hello, Ali. Good morning. Ali Agha : Good morning. Morning, Tom, Drew. First question, Tom just wanted to come back to the staff report on Vogtle. Anything in there that that kind of surprised you and what do you make of the criticism they have on the approach that you all are taking. I think in their words you know, a premature focus on testing versus focusing on construction completion any thoughts there? Tom Fanning : Yeah. Sure, absolutely. Not really. I mean, a lot of the points they raised have been raised in the past in DCMs and other things. I can remember some discussion about not enough attention paid to milestones and too much attention paid to hours worked. And I can remember commentary over the past that you know, we had this ramp up of ours and there was no concern about whether we could do it. Well, in fact, we've demonstrated and I started saying that the last October's earnings call about how - you know don't listen to our rhetoric just watch and see if we can ramp up the hours, I am sure enough we have. So I get concerned you know, and that's their job. They're the adversarial staff. And like I said we respect those people. That's what they're doing. They're pointing out issues. We're well aware of the issues, we all know the issue. In terms of kind of the process, we think we have a really good balance on site right now of evaluating kind of the process of commodity work whether it's hours or material or whatever and focusing on milestones. It's very easy to think about kind of how all hours are not created equal. For example, some hours when we go to these weekly things and that's why we tried to and I guess this was two earnings calls ago, maybe three, that we started saying to you guys we're giving you hours and we think that's instructive. But as we start down this new rebase lining it's important to think about milestones because not all hours are created equal. In other words, some of the hours that we're talking about have nothing to do with critical path. They are illustrative of our ability to put deploy labor and productive hours in place. Let me just give you an example. We have now ramped up worked hours per week at around 188,000 hours per week, all we count are hours that accrue to productive work. So the delta between say 145 and 188, we believe it's headroom that allows us to increase productivity on site. Essentially this S-curve or sawtooth effect and get to where we want to be to 160,000 number. That's why we have some confidence. This idea about deferring some work in order to start a milestone, we completely, we all understand, we talk about this a lot in these meetings that they attend, we attend, the NRC attend, Bechtel attends. This is a very intentional strategy of people that have built nuclear plants before. And yeah, not all these hours are required in order to start a system test. But we think keeping to the aggressive schedule really helps us. In fact, some of the testing activities have already uncovered some benefits that will serve us well in the future in reducing hours. So sure, it's a balance, so we accept the point. But we think we're doing the right thing. Ali Agha : Got it. Secondly, just to clarify, the fact that you know you came in this quarter well above what you were budgeting for the quarter, was that all or primarily weather related. Given weather was so much better than normal or was there something else that caused you to come in so much better than your original expectation? Tom Fanning : I think the underlying utilities are doing great. Let me just kind of start there. These folks you know, we've had - and not to throw at anybody else, but if you look at resilience issues around the United States, whether there's temporary blackouts or things like that. We've had a reasonably hot summer, particularly in a month where we didn\u2019t expect it, May. The resilience of our system, the investments we've made over the years and we'll continue to make have proven to benefit our customers like nobody's business. And so, we're very happy I think with the operation of our system. And let me just also say, we don't often talk about it on these earnings call, but things like our ability to deliver service, Georgia Power for example, leads in customer service and customer satisfaction, we think that is a wonderful indicator of support for the hard work our thousands of employees do every day. The other thing I would say is recall this $0.80 per share that we did, did not include, I don't know $0.07 of divested earnings, Gulf Power doesn't include Puerto Rico that added considerably to last year. So on all fronts our franchise businesses are doing wonderfully well. Ali Agha : Okay. Last question. As you pointed out through the first half weather normalized sales are down about 1% or so. If I recall correctly, I think the budget for the year has been flat to up 1%. Are you re-looking at that or are you still confident you can get there? Andrew Evans : No I think we are very confident with the projection that we laid out. I've have to look at whether normalization over a longer time period. We've had I think two exaggerated quarters in that - I think it was probably February where we were with - it was considerably warmer than normal and now May it was in opposite season considerably warmer than normal. And so these two things tend to have - serve an exaggerating effect on our estimates of weather adjusted normal sales. But still pretty confident given the strength of the underlying economies here, job growth, residential and migration that would be in the right range for the year. Tom Fanning : We\u2019re gratified with customer growth. The other thing I would just add, what we see in some of these results is timing, a onetime effect, like the industrial that being down 2%. We really think kind of going forward that\u2019s a number more like 1%, absent these effects. So look it's very clear that we're in a little bit of a plateauing on the economy and I think that's why the Fed is kind of thinking about what they're doing. But by the other token, our companies are managing expenses under Drew's leadership and the execution at the operating company level. We are delivering terrific results. Georgia Power for example, top quartile you know, O&M right now. Andrew Evans : So we're able to accommodate whatever variances we see, be it weather or be it in organic sales. Ali Agha : Understood. Thank you. Andrew Evans : Thank you, sir. Operator : Our following question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hi, Tom. Hey, on the SPI Directs Performance Index slide, what's the reason for the uptick since May you know, when you look at that and how it's creeping up there? I'm just wondering what the - what's driving that? Tom Fanning : Let me get to the slide. Oh yes. Obviously, it's 4th of July. We did hit our numbers on that week. Michael Weinstein : So you expect it to come back down. Tom Fanning : Yeah, yeah. Michael Weinstein : Got you. All right. And on the ARO\u2026 Tom Fanning : And Michael, just\u2026 Michael Weinstein : Go ahead. Tom Fanning : Real quick, I'm sorry. If you heard in the script we talked about last three weeks. That was to exclude the 4th of July. Michael Weinstein : Got you. Tom Fanning : And remember the statistic we're showing here is a four week average. So it's picking up 4th of July. Michael Weinstein : Right. Hey, on the IRP and the IRO, and also the rate case. How much flexibility do you have in spending on coal ash remediation going forward, given public comments so far on the rate case and the filing amounts and concerns that you know about how the rate filings was a larger amount, just wondering if there is flexibility in how you can spread out that spending over time? Tom Fanning : Yes. So Drew, let's tag team on this because Drew's got this great stuff, but using executive privilege I am going to lead the away. Georgia hasn't had an increase since 2013, that was the increase they deferred, and now it's 2019. So when you think about the increase that Georgia Power is talking about, the frame of reference is kind of nine years. In other words, last six years no increase, three years looking forward. So think about the increase they're talking about in the context of nine years, okay. And so what they've done in order to deliver results is manage O&M. They're now top quartile easily and some other things. You have some kind of interesting data points. Andrew Evans : Well, to your point around the rate case, if you look at the impact the customer share of wallet and burden to bill rates have been basically unchanged over that eight or 10 year period with the rate increases have been proposed it's I think less than 1% in total over that. Michael your question really related to - related partially to ARO, what its implications might be for rate. I would tell you that the $10 billion program that we have today is today's best estimate of how that investment will unfold. The chances of it being overly accurate today are slim. We will modify that plan as we proceed and so the timing of expenditure will change over the period, the total amount will change. Recovery is the same feature which is we have a lot of flexibility and I think the Commission and Georgia Power are considering different ways for recovery that will reduce - ultimately reduce the burden on customers. Tom Fanning : And I think Drew raises the right point there. There is a balance between what we must do and we have an agreed upon plan with the state EPD and the whole thing. So we have a what and then as Drew correctly points out, we have a how out of recovery. So that will be the subject of the rate case and we're certainly not going to get in front of that. So that will be worked out in a constructive manner I'm confident. Michael Weinstein : Got you. Okay. Thank you very much. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our following question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael. How are you? Michael Lapides : I'm fine Tom. Thanks for taking the question. Real quick. You're doing a lot of fleet transformation with all the renewables with the extra gigawatt of coal retirements. How are you thinking about, A, how this impacts the need for incremental transmission across the system. And B, when you think you'll start seeing similar fleet transformation and in your other large jurisdiction in Alabama? Tom Fanning : Yeah. So that's a terrific question. In fact, part of the IRP, one of the reasons why we love our IRP process in the Southeast is, we are able to iterate around generation and transmission decisions, that's really difficult in the so-called organized markets. In fact, included in some of the closures and potential flexibility in the future is in fact an iteration around some major transmission projects. For example, I know that whether we do it you know in the next three years or down the road, building some more transmission east of plant Bowen, which is kind of Northeast Georgia that we want to go east of there to bolster our system makes a lot of sense. For years we have talked about transmission improvements along the bottom south of our system. So let's - we used to call it a southern highway, that it kind of shows increases from Mississippi across Alabama used to go into the Gulf. So the iteration around generation transmission - generation decisions and transmission is really important. What was the other part of your question? Michael Lapides : Well, just Alabama, when do you see happening playing out - when do you see a sizable, because if you think about your fleet transformation so far it's been mostly Georgia. When do you see that playing out in Alabama if it all? Tom Fanning : Well, so here's - Alabama has a different process than Georgia. Alabama did announce that they are going to retire a thousand megawatts of coal and they have been under a public process to procure more gas. We think that they will undertake a process that may give more clarity by the end of this year. But that really is between Alabama and their commission. So you just stay tuned. Michael Lapides : Okay. And then a little bit of a housekeeping one for Drew. Drew, it looks like the tax rate in the quarter was pretty low, if I just look at the financials in your - in your packet, like sub 15%. I'm just trying to think about - you know, how to think about the second half of the year in tax rates? Andrew Evans : I think that I'll have to probably answer your question in more detail when we get into the boiler room. But the two biggest drivers I think probably were ITC amortizations and current period and tax impacts in the sale of subsidiaries. I don't think that our rate will be significantly different on a normalized base system what we experienced last year. In fact, there was a gain on the Triton investment that had the biggest impact on our effective tax rate in the current period and we recorded some gain on investment tax credits from the sale of Nacogdoches. So a little bit modulated by the cleanup of the portfolio that we've been doing. Tom Fanning : And I guess we've announced it really, but we did sell off another piece of business at PowerSecure. A utility services business. Andrew Evans : That just helps sharpen our focus on that. Michael Lapides : Got it, guys. I'll follow up offline. Thank you, Tom, Drew for responding. Tom Fanning : Always great being with you. Thank you. Operator : Our following question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey good morning. How are you? Sophie Karp : Morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking my question. Tom Fanning : Oh, delighted. Sophie Karp : I wanted to maybe switch gears a little bit and ask you about the Mississippi. It's been kind of quiet, but there's been some changes in the commission and you're going to go in for a rate case later this year. I guess, what are your expectations about how this jurisdiction is going to shape up going forward if any and so what are you seeing there on the ground? Tom Fanning : Yeah, I think it's been quiet and that's good for everybody I think. You know, Mississippi continues to regain its footing after the plant Ratcliffe, Kemper County event. And you know, I would say since then we got the gas plant in place in a very constructive way. So I would say - I would determine it really since then it's been very constructive. We look forward to a fair process and certainly we're not going to get in front of what's going to be filed and what they'll think about it. But I think it's been very good. Sophie Karp : But your framework there has been in place for a really long time correct? Tom Fanning : Oh, absolutely, gosh, believe it or not. The performance evaluation plan they modified over the years, but it was put in place about the time that I was CFO there, which goes back to 1993, I think is when I came there from Australia. So it's about that old 25 years. Sophie Karp : Yeah. And should \u2013 do you also think that this kind of framework stays in place and maybe just the changes around the edges or should we... Tom Fanning : Yeah. In fact, you know, what, you look around all of our three electric utilities have different processes and all of them are terrific. That performance evaluation plan is great. The RAC plan and Alabama has been great and the kind of three year process we go through Georgia has been great. And when I say great here's what I mean. At the end of the day they produce terrific results for customers and look at it, we've got among the lowest prices in the United States. I think Georgia now has more than 15% better than the national average. Customer satisfaction is high. We're able to handle kind of very thorny issues together with our regulator to produce great business results, that helps everybody. So while each of these mechanisms are different each of them work well. Sophie Karp : Got it. Thank you. Tom Fanning : You bet. Andrew Evans : Thanks, Sophie. Operator : Our following question comes from line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Christopher. How are you? Chris Turnure : Good morning, Tom and Andrew. Just a modeling question for you following up on some of the prior ones on the quarter itself. Are there any items included in your adjusted EPS that we could consider not recurring for next year? And in particular on the power or the gas side? Andrew Evans : In ex- items, I guess is your question. So ex-items were dominated by the gain on the sale of Mankato, Nacogdoches wholesale gas services are backed out. And then we had small charge for plants under construction which would be largely Kemper. Non-repeatable next year I think would probably be acquisition disposition integration impacts, but we will continue to back out wholesale services I think in the future. Tom Fanning : Hey, Chris. I thought you were saying in our adjusted earnings were there anything onetime or... Chris Turnure : Yeah. That's what I was driving at within the adjusted number. Tom Fanning : Yeah. Not that I'm aware of. I mean, other than what we talk about to you is I mean, weather junk like that. But no\u2026 Chris Turnure : No smaller gains on sales or anything in there? Tom Fanning : And one time as we tend to push those off into the ex-portion that Drew was talking about. Andrew Evans : Yeah, probably one of the bigger deltas relates to income we did have in \u201818 and didn't have a \u201819 which would be revenue from Puerto Rico. We did settle some small litigation in Southern Power about $12 million, so less than a penny, about a penny a share, but\u2026 Tom Fanning : Nothing significant. Andrew Evans : Nothing significant. Chris Turnure : Okay. Great. And then one other question on Vogtle, among the others here I think you were successfully able to hire 400 people I think for the day shift in June and then your goal was to shift them over tonight. Any more recent commentary for your progress in the month of July? Tom Fanning : Yeah. Well, here's the - yeah. Let me give you the breakdown on, remember as you point out and as we start adding people, most of that was going to go to the night shift. And in fact we've added a thousand people since the last call. And in fact, when you think about the percentage differences between where we were and where we are, I wanted to say we were, gosh 75, 25 day tonight. Now we're kind of 65, 45. So all of these additional personnel are going largely to the night shift. And so you know there is productivity issues and all that. But boy that's working well. And just to give you a quick commentary, we're pretty well done on pipe fares. As we've got all that we need. Electricians we're on track. We have what we need today, we'll probably add a few more. But we're very happy with where we are on staffing. Chris Turnure : Great. Thank you for the color. Tom Fanning : You bet. Operator : The following question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Andrew. How are you? Andrew Weisel : Very good, thanks. Good morning. Tom Fanning :  Good morning. Andrew Weisel : A follow on question on the Georgia IRP around coal sales or coal retirements - excuse me. Obviously that was part of the package, but obviously also some other people wanted additional coal plant retirements. Could you explain the strategy behind keeping some of those other units like Bowen 1 and 2 for example and is that economics versus reliability or how should we think about the potential for additional coal plant retirements? Tom Fanning : Yeah. So there again that\u2019s well-defined regulatory process in which to evaluate that. But it really goes to two big things, economics and then reliability. It is very clear that other forms of generation, regulatory environment around coal and carbon and everything else, that there's a lot of pressure on any sort of carbon emitting type of generation, clearly coal. And so therefore coal will continue to be under pressure over time. You can't just shut those things down and we demonstrated some of that in the IRP. When you think about Bowen 1 and 2 just for your example, it is lower in the dispatch curve than it has been over time, not because of cheap plentiful natural gas, it's continued to be pressure probably as we add renewables and a variety of other things and as we add nuclear. The notion of this inactive reserve taking it out of dispatch as a matter of resilience is a discussion point, right now. Nobody agreed to do that. But I think given the notion of the increasing importance of resilience and let me be clear, IRPs are founded under decades long mathematical practices that deal with the cost of outages and reliability, resilience and reliability says this is how my system acts under normal conditions, including weather variances and normal outages and a variety of other things. Resilience really goes to the idea of how my system operates under abnormal conditions, whether that's a hurricane or a snowstorm or a cyber attack or what have we had a major interruption in a gas pipeline. Are we thinking proactively skating to where the puck will be on ways to manage significant disruptions that we don't currently anticipate happening. And so that is where we get into these ideas like standby, I mean I'm sorry, inactive reserve. These are very constructive conversations that we're having with the staff and with the commission. And really I'm trying to elevate that conversation nationally. These are important issues we need to deal with. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Thank you. If I could squeeze in one follow-up. On this third quarter guidance, will you remind me your practice? Does that assume normal weather or does that reflect the favorable hot July weather we have seen? And then kind of as a follow-up to that for the full year, should we - I know you'll update guidance on the next quarterly call, but are there anything we should consider that might be an offset to the favorable weather? Or would it be fair to assume you're trending toward the high end of the guidance range? Andrew Evans : Our guidance or expectation for the - our expectation for the third quarter does assume normal weather. I think that's the simplest answer and you know as we've seen great volatility month to month and projection versus actual I think that's probably our best process for prospective planning. Tom Fanning : There's a joke upon this, I got to tell a joke. There\u2019s a joke among the CFO. I used to be CFO, remember. There was a CFO of Mississippi Power and we go through these meetings where Drew just - they all work together and beat each other up about what the right numbers are. And Frances Turnage, CFO of Mississippi Power one time said that all of our positive variances are temporary and all our negative variances are permanent and that's how she sets her numbers. But in general, Drew and team work really hard to get a good number for you guys. Andrew Evans : And you know, it's just not an appropriate quarter for us to update our expectations today. Let's get through the summer. The bulk of the summer heating season and we'll be able to give you a really good sense of how we think the year is going to come out. Tom Fanning : And you guys didn't ask a question, but I'll go ahead and answer the question. When Drew gives you the third quarter estimate that implies something for the fourth quarter. If you look historically we think we can handle that pretty easily. Andrew Weisel : Great. Thank you, guys. Tom Fanning : You bet. Operator : Our following question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hello, good morning. Thanks for joining us. Charles Fishman : Hey, just one question on slide 16, generation mix. Tom, if we look out 10 years and let's assume natural gas stays cheap. If I look at the right hand pie chart, nuclear obviously up, renewables up, coal down. What happens in natural gas? Tom Fanning : Yeah. Oh this is great stuff. So there is actually a lot of degrees of freedom in that question, right. So 10 years. But let me give you this. We have - in fact, this goes back to my time as COO. Oh so I'm telling old man stories now. This is 15 years ago, 20 years ago, but 15 years ago. We started using probability weighted way to think about carbon prices or the cost of carbon. And we do essentially a three by three matrix of high medium and low gas prices, high medium and low coal, high medium and low cost of carbon. So when we do an IRP we actually have prices of carbon that go into the probability estimate and we come up with in probability terms a dominant solution, that comes up as the IRP. The carbon prices we use our zero, $10 and $20 a tonne. It's very easy to manipulate that, manipulate meaning change it and put in new input that would say, what happens at $50 a tonne. And so we go through all sorts of stress analysis about that. Here's kind of the big variances, my sense and this is my judgment today no guarantee, you're going to continue to see low cheap gas forever. I mean, that's why we bought gas and that's why gas has been a great solution for us. So you're going to see gas migrate north, you're going to see renewables improve significantly, you're going to see nuclear with the addition of Vogtle 3 and 4 remain reasonably constant. And then over time you will see coal diminish. I think that's a matter of economics. It's a matter of a whole lot of thing. Now whether coal goes away from a capacity standpoint or just diminishes from an energy standpoint goes to these resiliency strategies I've been talking to. So who knows? This is where we made the commitment, we were first out of the gate, I think to say low to no carbon. How natural gas continues to stay in the mix depends upon at least one or two big technology innovations that we're working on. One deals with how are we going to manage the carbon atoms that come off hydrocarbon kind of looking fuel type. If we could continue to have success in capturing carbon and ultimately doing something positive with it then you'll see natural gas be really robust for a long period of time. The other one is storage. If you succeed in storage beyond kind of the lithium ion technology we see today you may see a much bigger penetration of renewables. So those are kind of the big swing points. Charles Fishman : Okay. Fascinating. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Operator : Our following question comes from the line of Phil Covello with ExodusPoint. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Thanks for joining us. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, it's actually Andy. Tom Fanning : Oh, Andy. How are you? Unidentified Analyst : Hopefully you're still thankful. Tom Fanning : Yeah, well you know, pretty much. Unidentified Analyst : Just very, very quick numbers question. So just - so the $10 that you're giving for the third quarter, I guess the trailing 12 months would be like 285 because it was like $0.25 in the fourth quarter. So again you know, assuming normal weather, what drives the fourth quarter to like $0.40 or something like that? What are the drivers? Andrew Evans : This is Drew. If you look at the last five years sort of the modern Southern era with gas, we've been sort of bimodal in our reported results something in the quarter to $0.50 range. And what has been modal is really whether in the third quarter and its impact ultimately on earned ROEs. And so as we move in - move through the third quarter we'll have a better sense of where we will be in terms of earn versus allowed. In the fourth quarter we\u2019ll either be sort of the supplement to a poor weather quarter in the third or it will be reflective of large reserves taken for customer refund in the fourth. And so I think that's kind of how we think about third - the interplay of third and fourth quarters. I think what we've set up is very consistent with our experience over the last four or five years. Tom Fanning : In other words if we've essentially had very beneficial weather in the third quarter that produces over earnings. And therefore, we have less earnings in the fourth quarter. Unidentified Analyst : So that\u2019s what happened last\u2026 Tom Fanning : And what you're seeing - and where we didn't have that kind of weather we tended to have less sharing and therefore better fourth quarter results. And Andy just to give you in \u201817 we earned $0.51 and in \u201815 we earned $0.44. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's perfect answer. Thank you very much. Operator : That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks. Tom Fanning : And I promise not to talk about the greatest Tour de France in the last 10 years. You know, it's interesting this is a important period I think for me personally. This is my - the anniversary of my first earnings call with the company after I took over from the great Art Beattie, and I would expect a call from him this afternoon. If I think about what our conversation was centered around last year really was whether or not completion of Vogtle 3 and 4 would occur. And I'm really sort of enjoy the fact that that we've moved on from that conversation I think because of structural improvements that we've put in ourselves, in terms of the commitment that we've made to you know advancing the construction. We've had major milestones met over the last year and we've converted a labour force largely from iron and concrete into pipe and to wire. If I look at what's ahead of us, we've got a couple of major milestones that we want people to focus on. I think we get a little bit overly myopic in terms of hourly rates or Canadian visas and it's promising I think that we've moved on and think about major milestones and their turnover. As we talk through this with investors, I think we're very open about the fact that we maintain reserves of both time and cost that we think will allow us to meet our expectations with the commission which ultimately is for completion in November of 21 and 22. And I think we're in good shape to meet those commitments. It's been a - I think a very important year in terms of the success of the company in advancing that effort. Andrew Evans : Hey they only cherry I'll put on that one is this, you know, we said a year ago that 2019 would be an awfully important year. And if you look at the first half of this year, it's a great report card, lot of work ahead, nobody's counting any chickens at this point, but son of a gun you got to be happy with the first six months and we're happy with what we think lies ahead. So we'll keep working and hopefully we continue to deliver the good results that we have so far. Thanks everybody for joining us this morning and we'll see you soon. Take care. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company second quarter 2019 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Marion. I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, October 30, 2019. I will now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Marion. Good morning, and welcome to Southern Company's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Good morning and thank you all for joining us. This morning, we reported strong earnings per share substantially above our estimate. Year-to-date earnings through September have also exceeded our expectations and the fourth quarter is off to a strong start for our electric utilities with unseasonably warm temperatures in early October. Drew will further discuss our earnings results and expectations in a few minutes. Before providing you with an update on our progress at the Vogtle site, I want to highlight our outstanding operational performance this quarter. We experienced record heat in the Southeast this summer, recording all-time September peak load days, four times during the month. Our electric system demonstrated resilience with record peak season generation in transmission performance, resulting in exceptional reliability for our customers. Importantly, even amid these conditions, a diverse field mix enabled Southern Company system to reduce our carbon emissions by approximately 35% compared to the strongest demand of 2007, our benchmark year for carbon emissions. Let's now turn to an update on Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4. The site continues to make progress as demonstrated by the achievement of several milestones during the quarter, including the start of integrated flushing activities. We remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates, and we continue to maintain an aggressive work plan on site as a tool to help position us to meet those dates. There is no change in our total estimated cost to complete the project. Last quarter, we discussed at length the contingency we established for the project in the second quarter of 2018. Recall the total amount we established is $800 million for the entire project of which Georgia Power\u2019s share is $366 million. For the quarter, Georgia Power has allocated $30 million of its project contingency into the base project capital cost forecast. There are a host of factors both positive and negative that go into that analysis. But the biggest factor in allocating contingency was probably increased costs forecast related to craft attraction and retention. To give you context, contingency as a proportion of the estimate to complete is larger today than when it was established 15 months ago. We continue to believe that we have sufficient contingency to meet the budget associated with the November regulatory approved in-service dates. Overall, including engineering, procurement, and initial test plan activities, the entire project is approximately 81% complete with Unit 3 direct construction currently 77% complete. The project major milestones for 2019 have been achieved, or are expected to begin as planned later this year. We continue to successfully attract and retain craft labor. And currently, we believe, we have the resources necessary on site to support our aggressive work plan. Over the past several quarters, we have experienced periods of fluctuation and productivity around significant startup and construction activities. This variability has resulted in a sawtooth or S-curve shape in our performance charts, an effect we discussed on our last earnings call. In August, as we started our integrated flushing activities, we saw a similar effect on Unit 3\u2019s productivity. Production levels have improved in recent weeks, and we are seeing the positive impact of a mature workforce with an increased ability to balance the needs of both construction and testing on site. The site has averaged nearly 150,000 earned hours over the past four weeks, with two recent weeks at about 160,000 hours, a record on the site. Cumulative CPI remains near last quarter\u2019s levels, reflecting the construction and testing balance I just mentioned. On previous calls, we have focused on both Units 3 and 4 in the aggregate. At this point in the project, Unit 4 is progressing slightly ahead of its aggressive site plan. As you can see on Slide 7, Unit 3 construction is currently lagging its aggressive site plan. The primary driver is a backlog in the installation of electrical commodities and increased system turnover activity, trends we discussed last quarter. Southern Nuclear and Bechtel are implementing a productivity improvement plan to address the electrical backlog. Additionally, project leadership is utilizing specialized teams to focus on commodities installation and adds further enhanced night shift efficiency and has streamlined preparation for system turnovers. These initiatives have demonstrated initial success, as I have already noted, and further improvement is expected. With these actions, we believe there is sufficient flexibility and margin in future testing and startup activities to maintain Unit 3\u2019s aggressive site plan milestone targets. To that end, we began the start of integrated flush activities for Unit 3 in August consistent with the aggressive site plan. Integrated flush is proceeding as we expected at over 60% complete and continues to support the start of open vessel testing later this year our next major milestone expected for 2019. Open vessel testing will continue through the first quarter of 2020 as we prepare for cold-hydro testing. Additionally, we expect to have the ability to test plant systems from the main control room before the end of the year. Each of these major milestones is important to the successful startup and operation of the plant and will lay the foundation for commercial operations. We continue to believe that working to an aggressive site plan is the right strategy in support of our primary goal of bringing Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 online by the regulatory approved November 2021 and 2022 in-service dates. This is a very exciting time for the Vogtle project. Within a year, we expect construction to be largely complete for Unit 3 and we expect to be preparing Unit 3 for fuel load. Consistent with past practice, we will continue to provide updates on our earnings calls and through the regulatory process as we move towards these major milestones. I will now turn the call over to Drew to cover our quarterly performance in greater detail. Drew Evans : Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2019, we achieved earnings per share of $1.34 on an adjusted basis. That's $0.24 higher than the estimate we provided on our last call and $0.20 higher than the earnings per share on an adjusted basis reported in the third quarter of 2018. A detailed reconciliation of our report and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and earnings package. A key driver but not the only driver of our quarterly results compared to last year was warmer than normal weather at our regulated electric utilities. Temperatures across our Southeast service territory were significantly warmer than normal during the third quarter of 2019, including the warmest September in the last 50 years, resulting in $0.09 of benefit compared to last year and $0.15 of benefit versus normal. Emphasizing Tom's earlier remarks, our operational performance over this period of prolonged high temperatures was nothing short of extraordinary. Excluding the impact of weather, our $0.11 increase over the prior-year was primarily driven by higher revenues at our regulated utilities. The revenue increase reflects the impacts of Tax Reform and related changes in capital structure. You will recall that the majority of tax benefits accrued to customers and we retained a portion at our regulated utilities to maintain credit metrics within those entities. The increase in revenue also reflects other pricing effects and customer growth net of changes in customer usage. All of these factors more than offset the impact of divested entities. We've also been successful in mitigating inflation related to O&M expense as we operate more efficiently. Taking a look at customer growth, through September, we have added over 30,000 new residential electric customers and over 21,000 residential natural gas customers across the regulated utilities. These additions put us on track to meet our full-year expectations for residential customer gains across our electric and gas franchises and are comparable to the growth we experienced in the same period last year. Customer growth continues to be driven primarily by strong job and population growth in our Southeast service territory. For the third quarter, weather-adjusted retail electric sales were down about 2% year-over-year versus last year due to a combination of factors including continued energy efficiency, technological advancements across all customer segments, and continued weaker Industrial sales. Industrial sales, particularly primary metals, petroleum, paper and textiles were down due to global trade concerns, as well as changes in production levels and demand response programs. These trends have persisted throughout 2019 with year-to-date electric sales down 1.7%. While the overall usage trend is negative year-over-year, it is consistent with our expectations. Weather normalization is also less precise in these extreme circumstances and we do not foresee a significant change either positive or negative in our service territories in the near-term. With adjusted earnings per share through September of $2.84, we expect to achieve full-year earnings at or slightly above the top-end of our guidance range of $3.10. Remember fourth quarter earnings can vary materially year-to-year due to sharing mechanisms at our regulated electric franchises that help mitigate the customer bill impacts related to extreme weather, a situation we have certainly seen to-date this year. Turning now to some updates on our capital requirements. In early August, Southern Company completed a $1.725 billion equity units offering when combined with our year-to-date equity issuance from internal plans to approximately $625 million and projected internal equity plan issuances through the end of 2019, this offering is expected to completely satisfy Southern Company\u2019s total equity need through our five-year plan period. We do not plan to utilize our at the money equity or ATM programs issue shares, and in 2020, we expect to begin open market purchases to satisfy the dividend reinvestment plan. Financial stability and strong credit metrics remain main top priorities for us as they provide significant benefit to our customers and investors. Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I'd like to give you a brief update on our regulatory calendar. We started the year with a full slate of regulatory proceedings, some of which we recently concluded. Earlier this month, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase for Nicor Wet Gas including $65 million related to Nicor\u2019s multi-year pipeline infrastructure replacement program already in rates under the investing in Illinois program. New rates also include a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers. This outcome is representative of a credit supportive Illinois regulatory environment and was in line with our expectations. Also, Virginia Natural Gas received approval to extend and expand its SAVE infrastructure replacement program with an estimated investment totaling $370 million through 2024. In Georgia, we're in the midst of a base rate case proceeding for both Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Power. We expect these proceedings to conclude in the fourth quarter of this year. Further, Mississippi Power expects to file a base rate case with the Mississippi PSC before the end of the year and we'll keep you posted as that schedule evolves. In addition to these proceedings, in September, Alabama Power filed with the Alabama Public Service Commission, a comprehensive proposal that addresses how the company is strategically planning to meet customer demand during the winter peak. Alabama Power\u2019s proposal include 2,400 megawatts of new generation capacity, comprised of long-term power purchase agreements, acquisitions, and new constructions with an expected capital investment totaling approximately $1.1 billion. The proposed generation mix is diverse calling for 1,800 megawatts of new gas fired capacity, 400 megawatts of solar projects with paired energy storage systems, and 200 megawatts of distributed energy and demand side management. We expect all regulatory approvals to be obtained by the end of the third quarter 2020. Tom, I will now turn the call back over to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks Drew. As Drew outlined, we are very busy on the regulatory front. We've demonstrated over the course of many decades that we're able to effectively manage our business to bring clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers who are at the center of everything we do. Our regulators share these same broad goals and we are confident that the ongoing proceedings will result in outcomes that support these objectives. Now, before we move to your questions, I'd like to highlight a few accomplishments that are in recognition for the company during the quarter. Both Alabama Power and Georgia Power were named a top U.S. utility for economic development by Site Selection Magazine. Economic development has always been a priority for our regulated utilities. And we successfully partner with state and community organizations to bring companies, jobs, and investment to the states where we operate each year. In addition, Southern Company's been acknowledged for our leadership on transparency and disclosure. South Company\u2019s 2019 proxy statement was named the number one proxy statement in the country in the inaugural U.S. Transparency Awards, sponsored by Labrador, a global communications firm specializing in regulated disclosure documents. We were also ranked third in the U.S. for overall disclosure by the same organization. These are all outstanding accomplishments and I am proud of our team. As we move towards the end of the year, we're very pleased with our performance from both a financial and operational perspective and believe we are well-positioned to deliver adjusted earnings per share for the full-year at or above the top of our guidance range. We've also completed our expected equity need through 2023. In the fourth quarter, we should have clarity on some of our remaining regulatory proceedings and will be in communication with you as these cases conclude. We have achieved several key milestones at Vogtle and remain focused on bringing Unit 3 and 4 online by their regulatory approved dates of November 2021 and November 2022. Thank you for joining us this morning. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Greg, good morning. Greg Gordon : Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. Tom Fanning : Thanks. Greg Gordon : Couple of questions. I know you gave us a lot of information with regard to Vogtle and we're all as pleased to hear that it's going well, but can you just clarify what you're -- what you mean when you say that for all intents and purposes now the contingency is a larger piece of the overall budget. Is that because you're doing better on sort of the expected base cost of building the plant before contingency? Tom Fanning : Yes, sure, Greg. I think Drew's got some great details here. I'll let him fill in the blanks on real details. That is a pretty easy concept, when you put contingency in place as we talked about last quarter it's because it's an unknown cost that you expect to spend, it\u2019s part of the official budget of the plant. As you go through, really we do this thing all the time, but just imagine every month we add-up all the positives and negatives around cost, and all the different components of the plant and we net those out. Until this quarter, we have never had the negatives kind of outweigh the positives in evaluating the contingency balance. This minor amount of $30 million that we just pulled out now represent costs that really relate to compensation that we put in place to attract and retain especially electrical workers on the site. When you take into account how much contingency as a percent of remaining cost was in place, when we set up the budget, even accounting for the draw of $30 million against the contingency account, the percentage left for remaining construction is higher now than it was when we established contingency in the first place. Drew has some even better data there? Drew Evans : Well, certainly difficult to add to that. I\u2019ll just say that the estimate to complete is the denominator and the contingency is the numerator. And so that ratio is now larger than when we started. I think the only other feature that's worth noting is that, if you think about time in our contingency and time, we're 25 months out from hot functional testing. So we're pretty close to construction completion -- Tom Fanning : On both units. Drew Evans : \u2026for the delivery of Unit 3. I'm sorry, 13 months. If you look at our delivery expectation, which is November of 2021, that's 25 months. If you look at the amount of time and contingency that we maintain today, it's greater than nearly 25%. So six months over those denominators. So I think both the cost factor and the time factor give us some comfort that we can deliver within the regulatory expectation. Tom Fanning : So Drew big as a breadbox, 24%, 25% now. What was it when we established contingency round numbers? Drew Evans : Little less than 20%. Tom Fanning : Yes. So you can see as a percent of total cost contingency now is higher as a percent, even accounting for the $30 million than it was when we established it. And that really is a function of time. Greg Gordon : Thanks. I've got two more questions. One is -- it's also a little bit remarkable in that despite the record demand you had this summer but you were able to keep O&M flat in the quarter. So I mean, that's actually, to me like a pretty positive marker, can you talk to how you were able to keep O&M under control, even though you had such high levels of demand? Tom Fanning : Let me give some kudos. Drew used to be CEO of AGL Resources, and before that he was the CFO. And when we looked in the diagnostics of that company as we are making the acquisition, he and his team there had a great track record of thinking about effective ways to deploy O&M, technology, et cetera. So he's come over, Beth Reese has come over with a key player and they're applying a lot of those concepts here. Drew Evans : It\u2019s -- cost control is, needs to be a long-term discipline, I would say that the vast majority of what's occurring here is not smart people moving over, but really the hard work of folks that operate underlying utilities. And as folks move into rate cases, they have to be very focused on cost control; we have to remember that $1 of cost saved allows $8 worth of capital investment and improvement in modernization of our systems. And so rather than looking for large belt tightening exercise, I think the right discipline for us is to be prudent about managing inflations within our business. And that's what we're trying to demonstrate this year. Tom Fanning : And then there's just been the big technology substitutions. You may recall that I think we led the world in local offices for so many years. And that was really important to us. But with the advent of technology, I think Georgia Power has demonstrated that without the local offices, they can still increase customer touch through technology, by over 400%. So we can remove some physical costs, improve technology and improve customer service all at the same time. Greg Gordon : Fantastic. My final question is milestones on the Georgia Power rate case, if we're going to get to a point where we can settle it, what's the usual cadence of that and how do you get to an answer that hopefully retains the integrity of the ROE band that you're currently put at risk/opportunity for achieving in light of the initial staff position being such a low ROE number. Tom Fanning : Yes. And Greg, you've been following us for 100 years, I think and so many of you on the phone have as well. Yes, look we've had this three-year rate process, the accounting order process in place in Georgia, since 1995. And I think every three years since 1995, we've gone through this process. The staff does what the staff does, and they'll - it's funny, we kind of went back and looked at prior iterations of these rate cases, what they've done in terms of their recommendation is not all that different than what they've done in the past. Look, let the process continue, typically in the past I think we've reached an agreement right before the Christmas holidays, I expect that will be the case this time. Greg Gordon : Thanks guys, great quarter, congrats. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Michael, how are you? Michael Weinstein : Hi, good morning. I'm doing good, how are you doing? Tom Fanning : Terrific. Michael Weinstein : Glad to hear. Hey, could you talk a little bit more about the low or the negative weather normalized sales growth on the electric territories? And whether that -- you think that that's kind of something that's maybe shaping up for the future as well or is this something that's only affecting this year, maybe next year? Tom Fanning : Yes, I'm going to turn this over to Drew in a second. I'm going to offer my comment. If you look across the board, I always like to take kind of a mega look at this. When we saw these numbers, we said part of this is an adjustment for weather normal with the extreme weather we had, those adjustments are always subject to second guessing. The other one, if you remember, and Mike, you\u2019re around go back to 2018, we had surprisingly high increases in retail sales. And in fact, I just have the numbers in front of me, for the same period for 2018, we were 1.7% up, this year we were negative 2.7%. In terms of residential, we were 1.9% up this time we were 1.9% down essentially flat over two years. Commercial, we were 1.1% up here a little bit down; Industrial we were 2.3% up now we\u2019re 3.3% down. My view is if you take a longer view, these sales are kind of within the range of expectations. There's a whole lot going on right now also in terms of the Industrial economy. One of the things I always love to talk about is Industrial development, economic development, always kind of consider that the headlights. As we talk about a lot, capital investment, long-term investment, loves calm waters; they love nice stable environments in which to invest. While our economic development projects are about the same, or maybe 5% less year-over-year, but still a good number, the amount of long-term capital associated with our economic development backlog is down a lot around a half and the jobs associated with that are down a lot about a half. And you get into these arguments. Well, is this a function of the Fed, is it trade policy, is it -- I really think that long-term investment on the part of our customers is taking a breather. It's kind of plateaued out a bit really as a function of the trade issue going on the skirmish, whatever you want to call it. When we pass new tax law, when we had the advent of smarter regulation, there was an enormous breath of oxygen in the economy and we took off. My sense is pending the resolution of the trade skirmishes and maybe even the election year in 2020, I think we have the ability of sustained economy going forward or not, we'll see. Drew Evans : It's probably the only thing I'd add is, the way we plan long-term or have been planning in the more recent term for sales growth has been around an expectation that our customer accounts particularly residential would grow by about 1% a year. We offset that with the expectation that efficiencies will be persistent and that will lose, used for customer at about the same rate, maybe something a little bit less. This quarter actually this year-to-date, we\u2019re down about 1.7% in total sales across all three customer classes. And I don't know if we've detailed them for you in the slides, but it's effectively nine-tenths in residential, 1.7% in commercial and about 2.5% in Industrial. This weather normalization is something that we have to construct internally; it is based on linear regression to be completely nerdy about it. And we've moved into non-linear portions of weather experience, which just means that we've hit some extremes. And some, I'm pretty certain that what we're seeing is maybe just a little bit of dissociation from our curves and not so much a result. If you look at last year, we saw about a 1.4% increase in retail sales through the third quarter that probably had the same sort of feature in that, maybe averaging these two years gives us a better indication of what's happening in our economy. Residential and commercial in particular, I think we're probably just seeing normal or expected declines in these areas. In the Industrial segment, probably since the fourth quarter of last year, we have seen Industrial production which doesn't have sort of a weather feature, migrate a bit down over the past maybe four or five quarters, as Tom said, probably due to a little bit of uncertainty and some trade headwinds. But we also have to remember that these are off of pretty significant highs in terms of levels of production at the end of 2018. And so these are just trends that we're monitoring. I would suggest that we look maybe more toward full-year, weather usage as normalization will become a bit more normalized, and that'll help us get a better understanding of how we're budgeting for next year. Tom Fanning : Hey, one last comment following-in Drew's nerdy comments. As I was with the Fed for so many years, one of the things I love to look at is essentially the first derivative of change. And the momentum statistics in other words, evaluating how the numbers were changing over time also indicate it\u2019s kind of plateauing. I don't know when this will resolve itself trading, the trade wars or whether it's the Election, but of the top 10 industrial sectors, year-over-year, you've seen about five of them go negative. So there is negative momentum. About three of them are flat, and about two of them are positive. And the two that are positive, are just less negative year-over-year. So I think all that data serves to underscore the fact that we are in a bit of a pause. And I think the pause can be resolved. So we'll see. Michael Weinstein : Okay, one last question. Could you just go over maybe what your future plans are at Southern Power? Are there going to be more asset sales coming or we kind of settle down at this point? Tom Fanning : Well, we've always been in the posture of recycling capital. I think if you look at our track record, broadly from an M&A standpoint, we bought well, and we've sold well. And we always look for opportunistic ways to improve shareholder value. What is it we reallocate about $500 million a year, that's way off of where we were? We had then about a $1.5 billion allocation a year, we've cut that now by two-thirds down to $500 million. But you want to know something? A lot of that is a function of the market. We really see a tremendous amount of competition in the market with shorter terms on we love long-term bilateral contracts, those are getting shorter, and the margins are getting narrower. So when we look at the balance of capital allocation, I think, going forward for the next, I don't know three to five years, we're 93-plus-percent allocating to our core franchise businesses. We think on a risk adjusted data that's more attractive in the so-called certainly the organized markets or even the renewables markets right now. We'll keep our eye on it. But that's our posture. Drew Evans : Yes, Michael, it's fair to say, a lot of the work that we did last year was simplification of that business structure. And so we tried to get rid of assets that weren't gas assets that were not within our core service territory. Some of those things that we did around wind and solar were optimization of capital deployments, but not outright sale of assets. I think more importantly, we've just recently announced the purchase of Skookumchuck which is a wind generating asset; we're still very interested in investment in renewables. But as Tom said, we're going to be focused on the risk adjusted returns on those investments and be very careful of -- about what meets our threshold. Tom Fanning : And it's just narrower than it was. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning. Tom Fanning : Hey Julien, how are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great, thank you. Hey, so just wanted to follow-up on a couple little details here. First up, as you think about where you're tracking in terms of dates here, just want to be extra clear heard your commentary about Unit 4, how that's going fairly well. How do you think about the main date for Unit 3 here? Just want to clarify here, given all your more constructive commentary? Tom Fanning : Yes, the site continues to work towards the aggressive plan. We have always characterized the main schedules, both for Unit 3 and 4 as aggressive. Okay, we think that is the right way to run the site. Steve Kuczynski, the CEO of our Nuclear business, Glen Chick, the guy that really runs the project day-to-day, believe that\u2019s still achievable. It is aggressive and we remain committed to that kind of work plan on site. I always want to remind people, our regulatory approved dates are November. And I think I've been famous for saying this in the past. If we hit those dates, we hit anything before that Ticker Tape parade time. But we think this approach of keeping an aggressive posture on sites avails us margin to achieve ultimately our regulatory approved dates. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And I want to understand a little bit more on the contingency. So it sounds like the $30 million here the small utilization is more for construction and some of the higher costs to keep the qualified individuals around. But when I think about contingency conceptually here, as we pivot a little bit, should we think about that principally being allocated towards some of these in-service criteria and achieving those on time and on budget. And then even within that, can you clarify how are you thinking about these in-service criteria? Which of these processes or ITAAC should we be following or asking you or paying attention to most closely as best you see it? Tom Fanning : Well, let me hit ITAAC first. I can remember geez three or four years ago, as we talked through this thing, we had ITAACs out there as one of the big risks. Now, let me underscore this. ITAAC must be done before we fuel-load okay, so it must be done. But I would say the work of the team in conjunction with the NRC over the years has brought that into a less risky posture. In other words, I believe we have a sound plan working with our regulator to achieve those milestones. So when I think about the top 10 risks on the project, I don't think ITAACs are there right now. I think we see our way through, we're making great progress. You may remember, we started a concept called UIS. But essentially, ITAAC that are complete except for the results of a test that has been very effective in reducing the byways of testing that must be done. So, I guess the other comment I would just make and I guess this goes to the contingency question. When we set that estimate in place, I guess it was July of 2018 that included for the whole project of $800 million contingency. There were actually buckets of contingency elsewhere like Bechtel has their own, we have our own. This is the one that we've called out specifically. And this is where the $30 million applies, Georgia Power dollars alone. And we call also that when we made this draw this $30 million, this is an evaluation, not of current period, but expected future period costs. So it is all the costs that we know about right now through the completion of the project that resulted in a $30 million draw. So I think we're in good shape, if that answered your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Or maybe clarify that, you're using this for construction and labor costs, but with respect to some of these in-service criteria, and just achieving those milestones, you feel pretty good. You haven't used any contingency. But should we be expecting updates on contingency to be principally focused on the in-service or the construction side of this, if one can buy anything? Tom Fanning : I mean there's buckets everywhere. And so when we did the $800 million plus everything else I mentioned that, Bechtel may have or we may have in our hip pocket somewhere. That includes a schedule that concludes in November and includes all known future costs through November, okay. Drew Evans : I think the only couple components I would add are that when we do a re-estimate of costs, it is a mark to completion of both facilities. And so we're estimating what we think it will take to complete both Units 3 and 4. And so this is not just a feature for the unit in the near, the Unit 3 in the near-term. In the end, though, Julien, money, time is money. And so a lot of contingency as we progress will be related to the amount of time, it will take to complete the project. That's -- I don't know that there are any expectations that there are system components that wind-up being more expensive than estimated. Tom Fanning : The only thing I would reinforce though, is when we set that budget, that budget was set for November. So to the extent you finish sooner than November, you get pickups. That saves money. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello Praful, thank you for joining us. Praful Mehta : Yes, great call and great quarter. So congratulations. Just had a couple of quick questions, maybe just touching on Vogtle again, as you decide on trying to hit the November deadline and you have additional money to spend maybe to hit that earlier deadline versus allowing it to slip to November or it guess hit the November deadline. How do you choose on the cost side like are you looking to invest more to hit the earlier deadline the May deadline? Are you willing to allow the November deadline or target to kind of get to that and conserve on the cost side? Tom Fanning : Well, it's any and all right, Drew said it a second ago, time is money. When you think about the hotel costs of personnel on the site, and the work that must be done. To the extent you're able to improve schedule, it takes a lot of cost to exceed the cost of time. So it's pretty much a dominant solution. If we can advance the calendar, if we can -- that's why we keep an aggressive site plan from that. That overwhelms generally speaking, the cost that we incur to do that. We always make an evaluation of that point however. In other words, we're not going to do anything stupid in terms of cost, just to achieve schedule. We always balance that. But I'll just tell you, the math is pretty compelling. If you can achieve schedule performance that does a lot for cost performance, and we believe that is prudent behavior. Praful Mehta : Got you. It makes sense, that's helpful and then maybe on the weather normalized sales, again just touching on that given you have all the CapEx plans and Alabama Power\u2019s investment as well. Do you think there's any implication on that load growth concern in terms of what that could do to bills given investment cycles and what you have going on with Alabama Power? Drew Evans : I think that's why we've got to focus on our cost structure. I think we -- mentioned it earlier, but $1 of cost savings permits $8 worth of capital investment. Alabama in particular, I think is proposing a resource mix that's important for meeting their winter peaking and makes pretty progressive strides in terms of the environmental content of what they're generating with. And so and ultimately I think will reduce total costs if you look at the O&M costs structure around coal fired generation. So what we're really trying to do is minimize in total, the impact on customer bills over time, but still have good investment in modernization. I suppose your question was, will lack of customer growth cycle it, it certainly makes it easier if you're -- if the underlying is growing but I don't think it probably reduces from our expectations. Tom Fanning : Yes as me and Drew sit here and we sit in the management council meetings at Southern, the objective is no rate change as a result of capital investment. In other words as we increased revenue requirements, we must take commensurate revenue requirements out in our O&M cost structure. The idea keeping rates flat as we transition the generating fleet or invest to improve reliability and resilience. Praful Mehta : Got you. Super helpful. And just a clean-up question, the income taxes in the third quarter, was the effective tax rate lower than previous and any particular driver on that tax rate? Drew Evans : No, I think more the third quarter of last year was a little bit anomalous, we had to make the assumption that we weren't going to utilize all of the film tax credits that we've purchased at one of the subsidiaries and so the difference really is a little bit unnatural in that regard. Tom Fanning : Hey, probably one more thing, somebody just warned me and I said, yes, that's probably right. Georgia Power recalled in its rate case deferred any rate action three years ago. And so if you think about where Georgia is, holy smokes, this rate case really covered essentially nine years of investment. So that's a whole lot. The formulation I gave you to have no rate change in the future as a design criteria as you were referencing in terms of the CapEx going forward, transitioning the fleet and building resilience. The design criteria is to make O&M adjustments that compensate and produced no rate increase to customers. That's the design. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Shahriar, how are you? Shahriar Pourreza : Good. Good morning, guys. How are you doing? Tom Fanning : Great. Shahriar Pourreza : So most of the questions were answered. It's very comprehensive. Just one follow-up around the retail sales and sort of the comments around more of the industrial activity. We've seen similar weakness reported by some of your other peers, right. But what turns out is, is the rate structure of the customers are I guess more fixed versus volumetric. So the EPS impact for deceleration in volumes is diminished. Do you have a sense on sort of the industrial customers and how we should think about their rate structure volumetric versus fixed. And I guess what I'm trying to get a sense on is if you see a prolonged weakness and you don't see a recovering industrial activity and sort of the global macro concerns are more prolonged, is there -- do you see an impact to fundamentals over the longer-term, right. So like, obviously, short-term, it's within your plan, but I'm just trying to get a sense on what the sensitivity is to Industrial weakness? Drew Evans : Well, from a corporate perspective, a 1% change in Industrial sales was about $16 million pre-tax and so pretty small impact. The Southeast generally uses Industrial customer rate design as a way to promote economic development and bring jobs to the region. So we're significantly less sensitive to it. I've probably created too much of a sensitivity to this factor in this question because we did have some demand side management programs that that worked productively in the period to make sure that we didn't have to curtail any needed delivery to customers and that we had, so we had good reliability to commercial and residential customers. And so that that will impact some of the sales figures as well. When we look at full-year though, I think we'll find that we're probably near our expectation which is around 1.5%, maybe 2% reduction in industrial demand in total. Tom Fanning : Yes, and just to add to that, I think Georgia Power was the first and big -- probably remains the biggest in terms of RTP, real time pricing. That recall sends a price signal to customers and customers on their own can react to it or not, in other words, if they're making more money by driving through a peak period will be good for them. If they want to shut down during a high cost period, they can take that as well. So these are customer driven demand side management kind of issues. This is nothing we do demand. We have the biggest program, I bet you in the United States, something like I think 40% to 50% of our Industrial and commercial load is subject to real time pricing. Over the year provides terrific value to our customer. Drew Evans : Right, okay. So just to summarize if there is weakness in Industrial activity worse than sort of what your internal plan assumes, we should not assume that there's -- there would be a deceleration in your growth trajectory or fundamentals just given the fact that it\u2019s not that sensitive. Okay. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello Stephen, thanks for coming in. Stephen Byrd : Congrats on a good quarter. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Stephen Byrd : Lot of questions have been addressed. I just wanted to touch on equipment testing at Vogtle, apart from the latest CCM just the status of overall testing, but any further color on where you stand with equipment testing, any lessons learned along the way, or just any further color on testing the equipment that's at the site? Tom Fanning : Yes, thanks for that question. What was it? Maybe a call ago or two calls ago, there was a lot of conversation about the wisdom of early testing, does it cost a lot, does it reduce productivity, create the S-Curve et cetera. I think our posture has been to test as early as we could, even for partial systems. And we think that we have found the issues early and have been able to handle them in a very successful way. Also, as we test early, we can bring lessons learned to other parts of the plant and to Unit 4, we think that's really, really helpful. It reduces risk. It assists in our ITAAC completions. And just to tell you for Unit 3, we think our civil testing is now for construction is well over 90%, mechanical, over 77% and electrical testing on Unit 3 is at 50%. So this testing process we're going through right now is exactly what we want to have happened. And here's the other thing that really also goes to the sawtooth or the S-curve effect. When we enter into an integrated flush, we start testing and we want to find problems. Part of testing is to identify where your weak spots may be as soon as you can, so that you can address them and have a successful completion of a milestone, ultimately. And we think that is really going well. As our testing organization has started out, we have found now over time, that their efforts have matured and they're more effective at testing the procedures, the deployment; the coordination with construction has all been getting better over time. I think our recent hours work kind of indicate that as well. This whole program while it has been the subject of some conversation has served us very well. Stephen Byrd : That's really great color. And my next question is very, very broad, but I'm just thinking about your generation mix overall and the evolution of Solar Economics. And looking at your Plant Daniel in Georgia maybe just think about it, as you think about your generation mix and just the evolution of renewables economics do you see any potential changes you would want to make to your generation mix over time or you sort of generally happy with your current resource planning on that? Tom Fanning : Well, so we do that we started this actually, when I was COO, we do a probability weighted kind of integrated resource plan, where we take different shots of different assumptions and probability weight them. In other words, we look at the cost of carbon. We already do that inside our math for our integrated resource plan. So we say there's no carbon price, and then there's $10, $20. We're now evaluating carbon costs prices as high as $50. We look at high medium low gas prices, coal prices, all kinds of things. And within all that scenario analysis, we come up with what we think are dominant solutions. Those dominant solutions manifest themselves in an evolution of where the best generation resources are and because we're not in a so-called organized market. In an integrated market, you can iterate around generation solutions and transmission solutions, okay. The other big thing I'm kind of nerding out now also, but I'll be -- I cover this quick is our reserve margin assumptions really change based on the penetration of renewables. The most important renewable resource for us and the Southeast is solar. We have pretty good resources, it's very cloudy here. But solar makes sense. We just don't have the kind of wind flows that support widespread wind generation. Our wind is imported through long-haul transmission systems, mostly from right now Kansas and Oklahoma. Okay, we go through this analysis and we develop optimal solutions over the next 20 to 30 years at both transmission and generation. And we do this in conjunction with each of our states so that this is a well-known process. As politics change, say for example, someone in a new administration wants to start a carbon tax, or there are different environmental costs associated with coal that we've seen over time. We certainly take those things into account. And so what we have is essentially a series of options-based solutions, where we can move the fleet. In general, what you find right now is Southern is between now and 2050, a much bigger share as you get towards the end date of renewables, that will mostly be solar. We will see a continued importance of gas at some point, very high carbon prices; you would see gas with carbon capture. Over time because of these costs, we see coal diminishing and we see a constant share of nuclear. The big swing in how these resources may follow depends upon technology investment, particularly in the realm of storage and the cost of carbon capture. You know that the objective function here is to provide low cost reliable electricity for the benefit of customers. And we have said low to no carbon by 2050. That low to no delta is really going to be spoken for by the advancement of technology, carbon capture, and storage. So we'll see. But that's the broad brush answer. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello Sophie. Sophie Karp : Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Tom Fanning : Thanks. Sophie Karp : Couple of questions if I may. First, I wanted to clarify and going back to Vogtle, I guess the SPI that you keep saying it needs to reach 1.5 in the next nine months, in order to be in line with the regulatory deadline and I guess looking at the VCM filing testimony last week, and just it's been built tracking below that. So far does it need to average at 1.5 or does it need to reach that number or does it mean that you are kind of eaten into that six months buffer you have like can you clarify that a little bit? Tom Fanning : Sure. Yes, look, I think you were just reading it opposite. In other words, we like a low SPI number, okay. What we would say by that 1.5 would be -- we would have to average that going forward in order to hit November. To the extent we're below that number as we are right now, I guess cumulative 1.03%, Unit 3, 1.01%, Unit 4, 0.96%. Remember, we said Unit 4 is tracking slightly ahead of the aggressive plan, that's indicated by a number less than one, one would essentially say you're on the aggressive plan, okay? Sophie Karp : Got it. Tom Fanning : So the fact that we're below is goodness, that's where you want to be. Sophie Karp : Got it. So you would want to be average no more than that, basically? Tom Fanning : Yes, you want to be less than something over 1.5. Sophie Karp : Got it. And then maybe a little bit of color on Mississippi as we have more visibility on who the nominees are for the commission. So how do you expect the regulatory climate there to shape up after the election and is that affecting your time and decision that gets in the rate case filing, do you plan to go after they have the election? Tom Fanning : We don't try to time elections or try to guess who's going to win. We think this company again; you go back to my history I'm in my 39th year for heaven's sake. We go through political swings all the time. Our regulatory plans, our service to customers, our notion of reliability is something that transcends politics and must be long-term. We always start with long-term answers first, and we work like dogs to make the short-term results be beneficial to investors. So we're going to file the rate case independent of any assessment of politics. And I think really, since Kemper, we've been treated really well in Mississippi; we think we've been treated fairly. We expect that to continue, no matter who's in office. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hey, good morning everybody. Tom Fanning : Good morning. Andrew Weisel : First question -- first question on financing. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to issue the equity units in August as opposed to the prior plan of using internal programs or even a block or more traditional equity forward? And just to clarify, when you say that the equity unit satisfy your needs to the five-year period, does that assume you will or will not use the full contingency for nuclear construction? Drew Evans : Well, I guess, taking them in two pieces. I'll start with the second one first. It does assume that we use contingency that's embedded in the way we accounted for the cost re-estimation last summer and our expectations for construction. Although, I would say that the Delta is somewhat immaterial to the corporation in total. We will do $8 billion to $9 billion worth of CapEx every year for the next number of years or $38 billion or $39 billion over the plan period. And Vogtle represents only $3 billion or $4 billion of that in aggregate. Your first question was related to the equity units offering which was a mandatory convertible preferred security that we issued in August. It had a number of features that I think drew us there, but not the least of which is that we are quite bullish or comfortable that we will complete the nuclear construction within the regulatory window. And we thought that issuing units that convert after the first unit goes into service is probably to our benefit. We think this share price has a bit of room to regain round to historical trading levels and that instrument allowed us to share in any upside and so we will literally share an upside through the high 60s, maybe low 70s in terms of its conversion when it does convert in August of 2022. Tom Fanning : Okay. And let me just offer my own commercial here. I can tell you this; this instrument was debated a lot internally. We think it was absolutely the right decision. But the math to me is pretty compelling for the future. And there's no promises here. I can't say whatever. But when you think about Southern Company and people are already making bets, I think, in our stock price. When you hear about Southern Company ex-Vogtle, there's no question in my mind, this company's been trading kind of on par recently, we should trade at a premium. So think about what a couple more turns may mean to the stock price and our P/E ratio. And recall we're in a period in Georgia Regulatory framework where essentially our ROEs coming out of Georgia look flattish. That's part of the rate design we had when we had the thing approved recently. As we clear these assets to in-service, the trajectory of earning increases significantly. I think you've all done your own modeling. When you think about a healthier P/E ratio, and you think about a much faster trajectory of EPS stock prices could be significant above this. We thought, though taking risk off the table, and at these attractive levels, made a whole lot of sense for us, and just took another issue of overhang off the stock. Drew Evans : Yes, the only thing I'd add, just to be clear, we do not plan to utilize the ATM program at all throughout our plan period. And we thought it was an important signal to equity investors that we were complete in our equity issuance and the instrument that you're describing allowed us to do that. Andrew Weisel : Great thanks, a lot of good detail there. And just to clarify this slide set that you will be issuing new shares for incentive compensation, what ballpark would be the annual need for that? Drew Evans : Let me -- I don't want to give you a halfway answer. So let us handle that maybe in a call after we can give you an absolute number, we'll keep -- we will issue shares under the drift for balance of year, there are still some options that are open to be exercised, where we don't control the timing. And there'll be some modest issuance relative to the total shareholder base related to executive compensation but I can't -- I can't offhand give you a number with much accuracy. Andrew Weisel : Not a problem, I will follow-up offline. Then just one last one, if I may, regarding the Alabama Power IRP or other petitions to certification, am I right that the $1.1 billion to the new gas plants and other capacity is incremental to the size of your CapEx plan that you previously laid out. And it still would be set that to the upside when you roll the plant forward with the fourth quarter results or would you de-prioritize spending either in that state or other states for things like affordability or the balance sheet or whatever else? Drew Evans : No, we do think it's incremental to our five-year plan. And we're comfortable that we can handle it within our expected cash generation capitalization goals. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Augustina [indiscernible] from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Augustina, thanks for joining us. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Just wanted to clarify one thing, so around the time when the baseline review was filed. Basically, I think there were identified like a total of 1.4 billion contingency, which basically consisted of $800 million cost contingency and $600 million of schedule contingency. So just wanted to understand if those $600 million are still unallocated? Drew Evans : Well, they're allocated the schedule assuming we hit November. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, perfect. Drew Evans : To the extent you finish sooner than November, you wouldn't need any of that. Unidentified Analyst : Exactly. Yes, okay, perfect. And then one other thing, if you just -- if you could just talk a little bit about what would be the top three risks for Vogtle going forward? Tom Fanning : Well, that's a good one. So we think about that a lot. The limited to three is always fun. But here's what I would say. Top three risks are going to be probably hitting our milestones. I know we've put out hours, but milestones are the big deal and it\u2019s not just when we begin. It's when we finish. And did we run into the testing program where we had some equipment failure where we had some issues that we just don't expect that could prolong the successful test of any particular milestone. We know of nothing right now that would suggest that but I would say that is a risk. Another risk will be just kind of maintaining the kind of recent productivity that we have had now, we are building margins. There\u2019s a wisdom on site of keeping an aggressive site plan gives us margin to November. And we want to preserve that as much as we can. We went through a very tough summer where it was very hot, hard working conditions, the thought to the fact of new work fronts being open, new people coming in. Can we maintain the kind of productivity improvements that we have seen recently, the last couple of weeks 160,000 last four weeks about 150,000? That's really good performance. Can we maintain it? I guess that's the last thing. And then -- and then I think just before fuel-load, that is going to be awfully important. Do we wrap up everything that even beyond hot functional test is non-critical path, I would say those three, people will argue about that. But I think that's it. I think that's a fair summation. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thank you so much. Tom Fanning : Let me just say, most of that translates with schedule; there are cost elements to that. That's probably it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Ali, always great to have you. Ali Agha : Thanks Tom, good morning. Good morning, Drew. Tom Fanning : Good morning. Ali Agha : Just a couple of things to clarify. One I wanted to go back, you ended up getting or earning $0.24 above what you have budgeted for the quarter. And I know you mentioned the weather as a factor but can you flush that out? Let me know what else came in better than expected and are these 2019 issues or some of them actually go into the future years, we should think about as positives as we're looking at, earnings in 2020 and beyond? Drew Evans : So weather was certainly the single largest factor sort of $0.09 of the positive variance. The two things that were different than our expectation were levels of operations and maintenance expense. And so we were able to control to a greater degree than where we had budgeted. And then revenue related to real time pricing. The system lambda, the system average cost was actually quite low through the time period, but there was some congestion that led to a slightly higher rate signaling to some industrial customers. Ali Agha : And so Drew is that at least the non-weather piece, should we think that that could continue the O&M and even maybe pricing as we\u2019re looking at 2020 and beyond? Drew Evans : Certainly things that we're working on, our RTP, real time pricing is more a function of the condition in the period. And so it's not something we view as being persistent. And let me just correct weather is $0.15 greater than expectation, although it's only $0.09 higher than where we were year-to-year. Ali Agha : Got it. And then secondly on Vogtle, Tom, if there was to be a change in either cost or schedule versus the way you're budgeting it right now, is the VCM the forum where you would give us an update, or would it be in some other fashion or forum? Tom Fanning : I mean, Ali, it was significant; we do an 8-K. I mean it really just depends on the magnitude. Ali Agha : I see, okay. And then lastly, can you just remind us as you\u2019re looking forward now, 2019 obviously is coming in well above what you were expecting at the beginning of the year. But can you just recalibrate for us the longer-term growth aspirations, the EPS growth aspirations that you're looking at? And what's the base from which you're looking at that growth? Tom Fanning : Yes it was 4% to 6% -- Drew Evans : Off of 287 which was our 2018 guidance. Tom Fanning : Yes. And even with this kind of base that we're in right now with Georgia, we're well within that cone. And when you start to clear these units into rate base, the trajectory really takes off. So it's 4% to 6% and of course, next year, we'll update all that. But we're well within what we said. Ali Agha : And I think Tom, you said you could hit 4% to 6% every year, or is it like a cumulative growth rate? Tom Fanning : It's kind of cumulative growth rate off of 2000, whatever it is 2018. Drew Evans : But we do expect to hit within that 4% to 6% range in each year -- Tom Fanning : Yes. Drew Evans : Off of 287 base, if you think about that as a cone of growth emanating from 287 will be within that band through the plan period is the expectation. Operator : Our last question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, thanks for taking my call and congrats Tom and guys on a good quarter. I have a question, there was something in the Georgia Power rate case testimony that stood out a little bit, which was one or two of the intervenors, I forget which one made commentary about instead of having coal ash spend run through rate base albeit on expedited amortization schedule. Actually seeing if it could get securitized that that would be better for the rate payor for the customer in terms of the bill impact, just curious for your thoughts on that whether it\u2019s even buyable under Georgia Statute and if not is there a mechanism or a method that would make sense to do stuff? Tom Fanning : Yes, well let me give a couple comments. Number one, that idea whether it's a good idea or not will require legislation in Georgia, we don't have such a thing. The other thing was I would also go back to the IRP discussion where this issue was considered and approved on in the IRP. But let the process workout and let the commission and the company and all the intervenors come to a successful conclusion, we think we will be treated well there. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. Thanks, Tom. Just housekeeping question for 2018 numbers for in the release for things like O&M et cetera, that includes or excludes the businesses sold in the last 12 to 18 months meaning last year\u2019s. I'm just looking at O&M it actually shows it\u2019s down more than $100 million. I wanted to make sure that was apples-to-apples. Drew Evans : The 2018 figure includes the O&M for the businesses that were owned in those years. Michael Lapides : Okay. Can you -- I forget, you may have done it and if I missed it my apologies. Can you quantify what the O&M change would have been without those business so like-for-like? Drew Evans : About flat I guess is the right way to think about it, but we can give you some detail. Tom Fanning : So instead of a decrease it would be flat. Drew Evans : Yes, okay. Tom Fanning : And that's how we characterize I think the O&M for the call here. And Drew, kind of big, big plan is to eat inflation every year. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Well, just want to thank everybody for joining us. This is an awfully exciting time for us all. And I know we all get focused on Vogtle 3 and 4. But the thing I want to reinforce is the thousands of people at Southern that are making this business home that even despite these really extreme loads we had, really through the summer, and even into October, there was one day very early October, where we do a system-weighted temperature. That system-weighted temperature in October was 91 degrees. This is a time we are normally hitting outage season and you're taking a lot of resources out of play. The system responded beautifully, the transmission people, the generation people, and we proved our flexibility and resilience in this kind of extreme condition. We continue to serve customers well. By all front this company is hitting all cylinders right now. So I know we all get excited and focused on Vogtle, I know I am. But I want you to know that the rest of the business is doing great. Thank you for your followership and look forward to talking with you soon. Take care. Operator : Thank you, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company third quarter 2019 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, February 20, 2020. I would like to turn the conference over to Scott Gammill, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Edison. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company\u2019s year end 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you we will be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I will turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the full year that exceeded our original guidance expectations and we are in line with the updated year end estimate we disclosed on the third quarter call. By all accounts, 2019 was an outstanding year for our company. We performed well across a broad range of metrics. We reached all 2019 major milestones at Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Operational performance at our state-regulated utilities was superb with record generation and transmission performance. We concluded several key regulatory proceedings, including constructive base rate cases for Nicor Gas, Georgia Power, and Atlanta Gas Light. We took steps to further strengthen our balance sheet. We continued to economically de-carbonize our generating fleet, decreasing our coal generating capacity by 2,000 megawatts and we expanded our portfolio of renewable energy sources, which is now over 12% of our generation mix. Our company is ranked in the top quartile nationally for customer satisfaction and we were named Best Company to Work For in our industry and 14th overall in the United States. So, overall, terrific performance. Let\u2019s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In April of 2019, we laid out an aggressive site work plan as a tool to achieve margin to meet the November 2021 and 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates. Executing this strategy resulted in substantial progress at the site and we reached all major milestones in 2019. The aggressive site work plan established last April set a goal of approaching 90% completion of Unit 3 direct construction by year end. Today, Unit 3 direct construction is 85% complete. As we have discussed in the past, Southern Nuclear evaluates projected cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis. As part of this process, we completed a scheduled refinement for Units 3 and 4 earlier this month, which in summary produced three major conclusions. First, we confirmed our ability to our expected ability to achieve the November \u201821 and November 2022 in-service dates. Second, we supported the site\u2019s strategy to continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan with no change to the May 2021 target in-service date for Unit 3 and a 2-month advancement of the target in-service date for Unit 4 to March 2022. And third, we confirmed no change in the projected overall capital cost forecast. Now, I will walk you through the details. Let\u2019s begin with some additional background on the schedule refinement. Over the past year, we continued to gain a greater understanding of the site capabilities for construction and testing, specifically for construction. In 2019, the site achieved sustained periods of 140,000 to 145,000 earned hours per week, but built a backlog to the April 2019 aggressive site work plan. The schedule refinement process took into account our 2019 performance and also our progress on work packages, testing and turnover. The resulting refined aggressive site work plan for 2020 relies on sustaining our current construction production levels and requires a reasonable increase in electrical commodity installation. On the refined aggressive site work plan, we have extended by about 6 weeks, 2 of our near-term milestones for Unit 3, starting cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. By extending these milestones, refining testing sequences between hot functional testing and fuel load and planning to complete non-critical electrical work later in the schedule, we now have more time to complete construction and work down the current backlog of construction hours. With these changes, the aggressive site work plan continues to target a Unit 3 fuel load by the end of this year supporting a May 2021 in-service date. The aggressive site work plan reflects a continuation of our strategy to drive construction productivity, complete testing activities and ultimately meet the regulatory approved in-service dates. Next, to complement the aggressive site work plan for Unit 3, we have established a November benchmark that forecasts construction production levels and future milestone dates necessary to support the regulatory approved in-service date of November 2021. This benchmark provides a clear comparison to the refined aggressive site work plan. On the November benchmark, fuel load could occur as late as the summer of 2021 in support of a November 2021 in-service date. The November benchmark also support our expectation that the aggressive site work plan is an appropriate strategy and provides sufficient flexibility to achieve the November 2021 regulatory approved in-service date. The result of the schedule refinement in the November benchmark is illustrated on the key milestones chart for Unit 3. The blue line represents the aggressive site work plan and the orange represents the November benchmark with the milestone start date shown in the circles and the direct construction percent complete detailed on the lines near the top. As you can see on the green bars, recently, we have been averaging about 2% completion per month for direct construction for Unit 3. If we maintain construction completion of approximately 2% of direct construction from each month from now until hot functional testing, we would expect to be close to the blue line or the aggressive site work plan. To achieve the November benchmark, we estimate this metric would need to be approximately 1.3% each month. Now, let\u2019s focus on estimated costs. In conjunction with the refined schedule in the fourth quarter, Georgia Power allocated an additional $110 million of its project contingency. Primary drivers for this allocation include a continuation of current cost and schedule productivity trends, which have been lower than planned. Through the fourth quarter of 2019, Georgia Power has allocated a total of $140 million. So, approximately 60% of our initial total cost contingency remains. Looking at it another way, the scheduled cost margin and the remaining cost contingency combined represent approximately 20% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. Recall the estimated cost of the time between the aggressive site work plan and the regulatory approved November in-service dates or there our scheduled margin is embedded in Georgia Power\u2019s base capital forecast. As we have said, we expect to utilize the entirety of these funds as we progress towards completion of the project. In summary, as I mentioned earlier, there is no change to the total estimated cost to complete the project. Finally, from a regulatory perspective, Georgia Power continues its Vogtle construction monitoring, or VCM, process with the Georgia Public Service Commission. VCM 2021, recall it, 12 months, was unanimously approved by the PSC on Tuesday. Georgia Power filed VCM \u201822 accounting for 6 months yesterday. In summary, we continue to expect that we will meet the November regulatory approved in-service dates and there is no change to our estimated cost to complete. It is important to recognize the substantial progress made on Vogtle Units 3 and 4 both in 2019. And really since the Southern Nuclear team assumed leadership at the site nearly 3 years ago, it is equally important to recognize that there is much work ahead, particularly in 2020. Our primary objective remains achievement of the regulatory approved November 2021 and 2022 in-service dates for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and we look forward to communicating progress on our major milestones in the month ahead. Drew, I will turn it over to you now for an update on the financials and our outlook. Drew Evans : Thanks, Tom and good afternoon everyone. First, I would like to echo the Tom\u2019s comments on an incredible year. In 2019, we achieved earnings per share of $3.11 on an adjusted basis above the guidance range that we established at the beginning of the year. We delivered this outstanding financial performance, while also returning to customers the benefits of tax reform and regulatory sharing programs, including additional one-time refunds to customers as a result of the Georgia Power rate case settlement. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in the morning\u2019s release and in the earnings package. 2019 EPS was $0.04 higher compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis primarily driven by higher earnings at our state-regulated utilities. Just to be clear, our performance is relative to year in 2018 that significantly exceeded the midpoint of our original guidance expectations in part due to strong weather at our state-regulated utilities. And in 2019, we more than offset $0.31 of EPS from entities we divested in the prior year. With that backdrop, the $0.04 year-over-year increase reflects the impacts of tax reform and related to changes in capital structure and continued investment at state-regulated utilities in support of infrastructure modernization, along with some customer growth. Recognizing the industry trend that customer used is declining, we have also been successful in mitigating internationally related to O&M expense as we always look to operate more efficiently. Turning to some operational highlights, for 2019, our energy supply mix was comprised of 50% natural gas, 22% coal, 16% nuclear and 12% renewables, notably, generation from coal decreased by almost 20% from 2018. This is consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and our commitment to deliver affordable energy to customers. We continue to experience strong population and job growth in our Southeast service territory, particularly in Georgia, which is the fifth fastest growing state in the U.S. Last year, we added over 41,000 new residential electric customers and nearly 30,000 residential natural gas customers across the state-regulated utilities, exceeding our full year expectation. Over the past 5 years, on average, we have seen weather-adjusted retail electric sales remain essentially flat. We have seen annual customer growth of roughly 1% offset by a decrease in customer usage of about the same percentage, reflecting continued energy efficiency in technology advancements. For 2019, specifically, we saw a trend of weaker industrial sales. This resulted largely from global trade uncertainty as well as changes in production levels and customer responses to real-time pricing. However, we do see some modest improvements emerging and we believe the Southeast is well-positioned to add customers as the industrial sector picks up. Overall, usage remains consistent with our expectation and we expect retail sales growth to be flat to 1% for the foreseeable future. Turning now to our expectation for 2020, our guidance range for the full year is $3.10 to $3.22. The $3.16 midpoint represents a compound annual growth rate of 5% from the midpoint of our 2018 guidance range. For the first quarter of 2020, we estimate that we will earn $0.72 per share. Our expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 4% to 6%, using the same base that we established in 2018 of $2.87 per share. With over 90% of total projected earnings over the 5-year planning horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Likewise, our balance sheet improvements, recent constructive regulatory results and ongoing focus on cost control serve to strengthen our outlook over the next several years as the lower ROEs related to Vogtle 3 and 4 construction phase-in and phase-out. Our long-term outlook also continues to be driven by capital investment in our state-regulated businesses. Our investment plan of $40 billion for the 2020 through 2024 timeframe includes projected rate base growth at our state-regulated utilities of approximately 6%. This updated plan reflects a $2 billion increase over last year\u2019s 5-year forecast. The main driver of the increase is incremental investment related to new electric generation and additional safety related gas pipeline replacement programs. Of the total, 95% is expected to be invested in our state-regulated utilities with a continued emphasis on transmission and distribution modernization. For Southern Power, the cumulative 5-year investment plan is comprised entirely of previously announced projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet, which supported by recent re-contracting successes is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded. We currently forecast no equity need over our 5-year plan horizon as a result of strategic value-accretive transactions that we have executed over the past 2 years and our August 2019 equity units offering. Financial integrity and strong credit ratings provide significant benefit to both customers and investors and has always been a very top priority for us. We have taken significant steps over the past 2 years to de-leverage our balance sheet decreasing our total company debt to capitalization by almost 8 percentage points and believe we are well-positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and improve our credit metrics. As part of this focus, we have engaged in an effort over the past year to simplify our business. This effort has included identifying and divesting assets that are not sufficient not of sufficient scale to be meaningful to Southern\u2019s overall value proposition. The announced sale of our ownership interest in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the pivotal LNG business to Dominion Energy is the most recent example of this business simplification effort. Additionally, on January 17, we closed on the sale of Southern Power\u2019s Plant Mankato to Xcel. And last year, we executed on the sale of LED lighting and utility infrastructure businesses that were originally acquired as part of the PowerSecure transaction. Lastly, in an effort to continue to improve our risk profile, we made a $1.1 billion voluntary contribution to our pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2019. This increased our funded status at year end to 100%. Further, we did not expect any additional required pension contributions over the next 5 years. Before I turn it over to Tom \u2013 turn it back to Tom, I would like to give you a brief update on our regulatory calendar. After a very full regulatory calendar agenda in 2019, we will return to a more normal pace in 2020. Proceedings related to Alabama Power Certificate of need for new generation are ongoing and resolution of Mississippi Power\u2019s base rate case is expected in the coming months. In addition, the second quarter \u2013 in the second quarter, Virginia natural gas expects to file a general rate case. We will keep you posted on all of these proceedings as they evolve. Thanks for your interest in Southern. And with that, I will turn it back over to Tom. Tom Fanning : Thanks Drew. Adding to your regulatory commentary, we started 2019 with a full slate of regulatory proceedings. The outcomes in these proceedings are once again representative of the constructive regulatory environments across our system that supports future investments in infrastructure to strengthen the reliability and resiliency of the state\u2019s electric and gas systems, while maintaining competitive rates for our customers. Drew briefly mentioned in his remarks that generation from coal-fired facilities decreased to 22% in 2019 and as a result today, coal energy only represents about 14% of Southern Company\u2019s total revenue. Importantly, carbon emissions have also declined by 44% since 2007, our high watermark for carbon emissions, which demonstrates that we are making good progress towards our 50% carbon reduction goal by 2030. I actually believe we will meet that goal with years to spare. We also continue to increase our renewables footprint and expect to have over 15,000 megawatts of renewable resources by 2022 across our state-regulated utilities in Southern Power. These are meaningful shifts in a relatively short timeframe. As we have set pathways to further de-carbonize our footprint and diversify our generating fleet, we remain mindful of potential economic, community and environmental impact to society. This effort will be a multi-decade transformation for our industry and we look forward to engaging with our many stakeholders. Now, before we move to your questions, I want to mention a recent charitable commitment made by the charitable foundations of Southern Company and its state-regulated utility companies, one of the largest commitments in our company\u2019s history. In January, we announced a $50 million multiyear initiative for students at historically black colleges and universities. The initiative aims to provide scholarships, internships, entrepreneurship training and leadership and career development to qualifying HBCU students. This investment is consistent with Southern Company\u2019s commitment to diversify in all forms. In making this commitment, we also hope to ignite giving from additional corporate partners to increase HBCU funding. 2019 was an excellent year by all accounts and we believe we are well-positioned to carry our strong momentum into 2020. We have a solid financial outlook for 2020 and beyond driven by continued investment in our state-regulated utility franchises that continue to be among the industry leaders for operational performance and customer satisfaction. As I have said, 2020 will be a pivotal year for the Vogtle project. We are committed to keeping you informed of major milestones and key productivity measures as we progress through the year and we remain focused on placing Units 3 and 4 in service by their regulatory approved dates of November 2021 and November 2022. This is certainly an exciting time to be in our industry. And at Southern Company, we have much to look forward to. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Does the financing plan include any additional significant divestitures going forward or is that pretty much done at this point or is there anything else that you might be considering going forward? And would that \u2013 if so would that be incremental to no equity needed and result maybe some kind of additional action? Tom Fanning : I will let Drew double team this one. I will lead off with this. I think we have demonstrated as well as anybody in the industry that we are good buyers and sellers. We always look opportunistically, strategically to improve our return to shareholders on a risk-adjusted basis. I think we have demonstrated that. So we are always kind of in the market. Does the plan assume any major activity in that regard? My answer is no. Drew Evans : Absolutely, right. Nothing assumed in the plan, nothing assumed about our growth and our investment requires additional divestiture. And I would say that principally around the transactions that we have just discussed, ACP, in particular our primary goal really has been, or secondary goal behind credit quality has been business simplification. And I think that, that\u2019s a major component of it. We just really wanted to select two assets that we thought would have a meaningful impact on Southern\u2019s prospective growth and at 5% that simply didn\u2019t do it and we think that was really just a good thing to execute around. Those same two principles will guide us through everything that we evaluate in the corporation in total, but there simply isn\u2019t any need for additional equity to fund the $40 billion investment. Tom Fanning : One of the things we like to say to ourselves, we remind ourselves all the time, don\u2019t do things that don\u2019t matter and that asset didn\u2019t really matter to us. Michael Weinstein : Right. And another question would be the difference, I guess, the compression and the schedule between Unit 3 and Unit 4. Is that \u2013 are there any \u2013 is there anything significant about that, that you can talk about that might lead to, for instance, maybe some acceleration on Unit 3 at some point? Tom Fanning : Well, sure, I mean it\u2019s all about lessons learned from Unit 3. When we think about I can even think of just some examples. We did initial energization of Unit 3 and we were very excited about that to achieve that milestone. In looking back, however, we think that delaying initial energization will allow us kind of more productivity improvement on Unit 4. We have always felt that as we adjust the schedule, which really moved us from the April 2019 to the February 2020 refinement, we always find that as we refine the schedule and move things forward and move things back, we can improve our ultimate performance and delivering. And that\u2019s what you see in the scheduled compression between 3 and 4. We picked up we think 2 months and that\u2019s good on a risk-adjusted basis. Michael Weinstein : That\u2019s great to hear. Hey, one last question, the $2 billion you have in the long-term plan for Southern Power and the infrastructure \u2013 contracted infrastructure business. Is that \u2013 what does that say about what is your philosophy going forward about investment in the unregulated part of the company going forward and in particular, maybe solar and renewables going forward? Tom Fanning : But we want to fix both the solar and renewables. So that\u2019s important. The second is really this it\u2019s a recognition of a tougher marketplace. We have lots of opportunity to invest in our franchise businesses. I think Drew pointed out, 95% is kind of focused in that direction. We have seen the market on a risk-adjusted basis just really tough and getting tougher. So, we don\u2019t try to expand our market share. Rather, we have a rather disciplined kind of investment thesis where over the long-term we try to gain about 150 basis points relative to the franchise investment in that long-term contracted business. Those projects are getting fewer and far between. We still want to have exposure. We have $500 million allocated per year over the next 5 years, but it\u2019s a tougher market to do business. Drew Evans : Yes, I think if you look at the base \u2013 sort of our base expectation of around $40 billion invested, almost $1 billion of that is in Southern Power over the time period and the vast majority of those things are already committed. We have got some very nice wind projects, Skookumchuck grading Wildhorse that rely on some wind turbines that we set aside prior to tax reform and we are really pleased to complete those projects. We would love to do more. It really is going to be dependent upon the return and attracting capital relative to that, that we can invest in state-regulated franchise. Tom Fanning : One other outcome is just kind of interesting who knows how it will turn out. But certainly, there has been more solar approved in the state of Georgia. I will remind you those of you that have followed us for years, a couple 2, 3 years ago Georgia Power was named by the solar industry as the investor owned utility of the year. You know that we don\u2019t have any renewable requirement in order to hit. It just makes good business sense. When you consider Alabama\u2019s integrated resource plan, there is new solar in there. There maybe opportunities in the Southeast as well, but whether those are third-parties or not we will see. Michael Weinstein : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Sophie. How are you? Sophie Karp : I am doing great. How are you guys? Tom Fanning : Fantastic. Thanks for joining us. Sophie Karp : Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a terrific year and all of the accomplishments. Tom Fanning : Yes, it\u2019s exciting. Sophie Karp : Yes, good stuff. Couple of questions that I have so the divestiture of your stake in ACP to the extent earnings that you were booking on that or contemplated in the original guidance which remains unchanged. What are the offsets that you are seeing that would make up for that? Tom Fanning : Big investment in our franchise businesses. Drew Evans : Yes. No, I think that\u2019s right. Our investment was pretty small to date. Construction has not progressed as rapidly as our original expectations there, and so our capital deployment was not heavy. The $150 $175 million in aggregate in proceeds from the two businesses really allows us to sort of offset whatever we had expected and planned for EPS. Tom Fanning : Our trajectory on capital investment and what drives EPS growth in our gas businesses has exceeded our expectations. And recall that is really associated with safety-related pipeline replacement programs. And we got through regulatory processes, both in Illinois and in Georgia. And of course, Georgia Power went through an IRP last year. And then the result of that IRP was largely accounted for in its three-year accounting order that was received at the end of the year. So I think we filled in with franchise investments. We look forward to more in the future when we look to Mississippi, we look to Alabama and Virginia. Sophie Karp : Got it. This is just super helpful. Thank you. And then just a broader, bigger picture question, I guess. So you are investing very heavily, obviously, in the zero-carbon generation being the Plant Vogtle. So with looking beyond that, is there a sense of needing to be more ESG-friendly, if I know if it\u2019s the right word, but this is an increase increasingly a focus in the space, right? And we see that the names who are making ESG-friendly investments are performing are getting the premium valuations and performing better. So is there internally a discussion of tailoring your strategy in alliance with this broader trend in the marketplace? Tom Fanning : Yes, and Sophie, thanks for that. Interestingly, we talked about that a lot at our Board, and we\u2019re having a special focus of just kind of global, what is going on in the ESG world in April in our next Board meeting. So this is a particular focus of ours. We view this as an and not an or. This is something that I think we\u2019ve had a lot of depth in, in the past, and it\u2019s really just kind of coming to fruition now. Before I became CEO of Southern, we were 70% coal, zero renewables. And you see the numbers now we gave you a new data point in our script today and that was 14% of our revenue. Drew Evans : Total revenue. Tom Fanning : Is associated with coal generation. That was a data point that came from one of our ESG investors. They wanted to see that kind of data. So we provided it. It\u2019s absolutely an impact that I think any responsible company will take. And I think in the broadest sense, Southern Company has been doing this for 100 years. We\u2019ve talked about being citizens wherever we serve, making sure that the communities are better off because we are there. When we think about ESG, it isn\u2019t just what\u2019s going on with carbon or the environment. It really goes to the broadest sense of making sure that the communities are better off because we\u2019re there. And I think we demonstrate that as well as anybody. This is not a company run by as per ESG. We have always taken into account all of our stakeholders. And I think that\u2019s the right way to drive long-run performance. Sophie Karp : Right, thank you so much for comments. Tom Fanning : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with STRH. Please proceed. Drew Evans : Hello, Ali. How are you? Ali Agha : Good. Good afternoon. First question on Vogtle, Drew, can you just remind us what was the net income contribution from Vogtle in 2019? And part two of that same question. Also, can you just remind us the main sort of difference between your view of the progress and the staff and the independent monitor\u2019s view? I mean, clearly, diametrically opposite in terms of their conclusions to where you are? Drew Evans : Well, yes. Tom Fanning : We can start with contribution and you could take the other. Drew Evans : Ali, it\u2019s a little bit of a complicated answer. We know that Vogtle in-service will produce something like $800 million worth of additional cash flow for the corporation and about $0.40 a share in aggregate. We have about half of that embedded in rates today as we collect as we construct a bit. There are some offsets like the ROE penalties that we incur as construction progresses. And those impacts could be $0.15 to $0.25 over the next couple of years since they are a bit of an offset. If you want to give us a call, later on, we can walk you through each of the individual years and how Vogtle contributes to income within Georgia. Tom Fanning : But I do want to hit the soft toss here. Drew Evans : Exactly. Tom Fanning : As we emerge from Vogtle, net income goes up. Drew Evans : An additional $0.20 a share, it\u2019s $40 million $0.40 worth of content. Tom Fanning : And I think I\u2019ve said this before when you think about kind of in the I\u2019m not giving guidance now, I\u2019m just doing dumb math. But when you emerge from this kind of penalty rate period, we\u2019re kind of in the 2023 time frame, somewhere in the $3.75, even the $4 range just from EPS, just transitioning from this kind of return environment to a full return environment. The other thing is it\u2019s a very interesting question, Ali. I really don\u2019t think we\u2019re diametrically opposed. Just yesterday, Drew and I were down at the site, and we sit there with all the co-owners, the independent monitors, everybody is there and members of the staff are there, the NRC there, DOE is there. So we are all hearing the same stuff. In some cases, it\u2019s a difference in philosophy. And we try to take a risk-adjusted approach to this very large and complex project. For example, we believe that accomplishing as much as we can as fast as we can is an enormous risk mitigator. You\u2019ve heard us use the expression before, Fail Fast. We\u2019d like to get our hands on major equipment and major systems and test them as early as we can two big benefits. When we do that, we let in the opportunity for these systems when problems invariably occur that they don\u2019t impact our critical path, one; two, that we can minimize cost as a result of those things; and three, that we gain lessons learned that we can apply to other systems throughout the plant. And we have proven that over and over and over again. We think that is absolutely the right thing to do. You will have seen testimony from some of the staff, etcetera, that would say, oh, we think you\u2019re testing too early. We absolutely disagree with that. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re diametrically opposed, the difference in philosophy. The other one would go to this, why are we driving so hard on achieving an aggressive site plan. Well, I think it\u2019s to incent the thousands of people that are there on the site to achieve to be the best they can be. Were we to relax our demands on the system at the site, we think we would just be giving up margin. And by giving up margin, we increase risk and our ability to handle unforeseen changes and to achieve ultimately the November 21 and November 22 milestones. In other words, it may sound crazy, but I think it\u2019s true. If we were just to adopt a November pathway, we think that would be a much riskier approach in building the plant than what we are doing right now. The other thing that\u2019s fun to look at is, go to the chart we have given you, I guess, that\u2019s on page 7. And what you can see is kind of our performance and how we see. I hate to take my foot off the accelerator on the plant. We have been achieving 2% on the average over the past. And you could see, December and January are we bit less, but that\u2019s holidays and kind of ramp up after the holidays. Otherwise, we\u2019re pretty confident we can hit 2%. The new aggressive site plan that is refined schedule assumes 2%. We could drop all the way down to 1.3% by hot functional test and still achieve the November schedule. And I love looking at the green line relative to the red and the blue lines. I think you can see the trajectory. Why slow down now. Let\u2019s do as much as we can, as efficiently as we can. And I think, overall, that\u2019s an enormous risk mitigator as a strategy to prosecute the construction of these plants. Ali Agha : I got it. Makes sense. Second question, when you look at that $40 billion CapEx plan over the next several years, any of that CapEx or any of the functionality of that CapEx where you think you may get bigger pushback from regulators or is your sense, there is full buy-in on all the regulated CapEx that you are planning over that time period? Drew Evans : I think time will tell on these IRPs, especially that\u2019s where the big hunk of it is. As you have just been through a rate case in Illinois and a rate case in Georgia with respect to Atlanta Gas Light, from the gas standpoint, that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of it. From the electric standpoint, the lion\u2019s share of it is at Georgia. We just finished the IRP and then we just finished the rate case. Ahead of us this year, and we never get ahead of regulatory processes, is the IRP conclusion in Alabama. Scott Gammill : The other thing, Ali, I think, I would look at is so we are talking about the $40 billion worth of investment, our depreciation over that time period is something in the range of $20 billion. So our net additions to rate base we think, is appropriate and prudent at about 5% a year in electric so maybe closer a little more than 10% a year in the natural gas business. The vast majority of expenditure in both of those categories is for modernization of transmission and distribution systems, which brings higher reliability for customers. We will get to a more aggressive modernization of the generating fleet overtime. But in the near term, I think these are very consistent with the priorities that the states have laid out individually for how capital should be deployed there. Tom Fanning : One more thing in this new concept of resilience really matters. I am helping lead the industry on all the cyber and national security work. It is a national security interest for this industry to invest in resilience, which is how your system operates under abnormal conditions as opposed to the old traditional engineering economics concept of reliability. Resilience does matter, and we should put forth the effort to make sure that our electric grid is as safe as it can be. Ali Agha : I got it. I was just saying, one, just one clarity on that. You show the CapEx with and then without pool closures. Can you just remind us why you show it without pool closures as well? Tom Fanning : I\u2019m sorry, pond closures. I think Ali Agha : Pond closures, yes, I used the wrong word. Tom Fanning : I\u2019m sorry okay, sorry about that. Drew Evans : Those are plans that we\u2019re working through today with commissioners. And I think we wanted to just demonstrate what they could be with or without that particular category or their relative contribution. Ali Agha : I see. I see. Okay. Thank you so much. Drew Evans : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael. How are you? Michael Lapides : I\u2019m fine. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m actually, it is two questions. First of all, how are you thinking about, when you look across the electric utility subsidiaries, kind of the post Vogtle which ones are right for incremental fleet transformation? You obviously have the plan laid out in Alabama right now for the next couple of years. How are you thinking about what happens next in Georgia and what happens next in Mississippi? Tom Fanning : So we do a we do a system plan and then every individual operating company has an integrated resource plan, whatever flavor they have in their state, that essentially operationalizes in that state the overall system plan. And of course, every state commission has their own ability to modify the plan, however, they see fit. Although I think we have been generally successful showing the benefit of kind of the benefit of scale that we have and the benefit of everybody playing within that scale. And one of the things that is an obvious kind of determining factor is that The Southern Company Power pool where everybody participates provides excellent outstanding economic value to all of our participants. So we get the benefit of a state-by-state solution, but we also get the benefit of an integrated long-term plan for generation and transmission, which is a benefit we have as an integrated system relative to the so called organized markets. So we have scale, we have the benefit of state by state input and we have the benefit of kind of a recognition that it\u2019s not just generation, it\u2019s generation and transmission, and we iterate around that. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. One other question, Tom, I know you are selling your stake in the Atlantic Coast pipeline, but the reality is it was a pretty small stake in what\u2019s been a pretty big project getting bigger. How are you thinking about the opportunity set for incremental gas pipeline investments, but kind of stuff that\u2019s more in your service territory or touching your service territory? Tom Fanning : Well, we did Southern Natural Gas pipeline with Kinder Morgan. Thought we got a really good outcome there. We have done a few things around the margin. Drew can speak to that probably better than me. We look at this stuff. My sense is there is two big factors that\u2019s just making pipeline investment tough these days. One is kind of the environmental pushback that really shows up as regulatory or permits or what have you. That\u2019s tough, that\u2019s a tough environment. The second one is the long-term question of natural gas in the system. Look, we absolutely believe I used to say when we bought AGL Resources that natural gas is a bridge to 2050. I really believe natural gas will go beyond 2050. I think in order to achieve low to no or net-zero concepts by 2050, given how plentiful and cheap natural gas is, we are just going to have to find a way to keep it in play, but deal with the carbon atom. You know that we, by far, lead the industry in investments in that regard with Wilsonville facility is our big research and development effort, where we run the national carbon capture research center we run the international carbon capture research center. And I think the next kind of generation, the first part of that was kind of focused at coal. We are going to start doing it on gas as well. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated. Sorry. Drew Evans : Michael, I think the only thing I\u2019d probably add is that we have been successful in smaller additions to our current infrastructure. We are really pleased with the investment in SONAT. We think that\u2019s a very important piece of infrastructure for the southeast for reliability, in particular, for generation. We have added things like the McDonald lateral. We\u2019ve talked to FERC and filed an SONAT expansion to some degree. But I think longer term, this is just a piece of infrastructure, given the difficulty for building new infrastructure that we\u2019ll rely on and be very proud that we have owned for a long period of time. Tom Fanning : Yes, yes, I said another way. Looking back, boy, that was a great acquisition because it exists and it works and it serves a little over half of our system now. Hey, one other thing is just an exciting thing. I am actually front-running and breaking a little move, but in the R&D realm, we are doing some direct air extraction of carbon. We\u2019re starting to plan that anyway. I will be announcing that around the annual meeting, but I guess I already did. But it\u2019s some exciting work that will get us to net zero we hope by 2050. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you Tom. Hey one last one, what\u2019s intended in your growth rate for O&M? Just in terms of how should we think about kind of O&M growth at the consolidated entity over the next couple of years? Drew Evans : Our goal is to generally blade inflation throughout the planned period. Michael Lapides : Okay, great. Thank you guys. Much appreciated as always. Drew Evans : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Julien. How are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: A quick question, coming back to the Vogtle timeline here, can you talk a little bit about the Sanmen experience on the cold and hot functional testing? Just thinking about how long was their experience in each of those phases? And maybe any of the learning\u2019s that came out of that, that we should be sort of following and you guys start to move through that for Unit 3 here? Tom Fanning : Well, let\u2019s think about this for a minute. There was a lot of noise going on as they moved these plants into service. If you remember, there was a big celebration around premier ESG where a lot of activity just really slowed or came to a halt. And we have people on the site there. There was nothing at the site that caused any discernible reason to slow down or stop what they were doing. Now their experience from fuel load to in-service is really pretty encouraging for us. So you may remember, we talked about these management windows, our flexibility period or what have you. In the February refined aggressive site plan. We have consumed about two months of our four months of total flex time if you will. So that allows us to move the start dates of some of our milestones six weeks and still maintain our schedule on fuel load and in-service. If you look at fuel load in-service, we still have six months. Now China averaged essentially 138 days, not 180 days. So we think we can beat the 180 days. China\u2019s debt was $112 million. We, frankly, think, and we\u2019ve got plans in place to beat that. Now maybe it\u2019s beat it by some margin. But in all, I think we\u2019ve got kind of two months of flexibility from fuel load in-service as demonstrated from China. The other thing that I just want to point out that I forget which unit it was, but some of these units when they started up they ran like a Swiss watch. They went post to post, breaker to breaker. So they performed beautifully. So we should have confidence that failing any equipment problems or anything else, which is why we do all the testing we do, we are going to get a good result. The only other thing I would just say, the regulation in the United States is way different than the regulation in China. So that may account for some differences from regime to regime. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then can you just talk about the timelines here? I mean 2 months on cold functional, for instance. Are there any specific data points that you may be point us to and perhaps more critically, help would be probably [indiscernible]? Tom Fanning : Hey, Julien. Hey, buddy you are breaking up. Could you be could you say that again? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry, hopefully, this is better. I\u2019m thinking about the timelines here for the hot and cold functional testing. Tom Fanning : Right. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: What are the public data points that we all should be looking for in the next, say, cumulatively 8 months here as you work your way through them, especially given how tight they are. For instance in the coal a couple of months for the coal functional testing as a follow-up? Tom Fanning : Well, so, yes, let\u2019s think about that. So we\u2019ve just filed all this stuff in the VCM. So you could go into the Georgia process and get that material to all public. One of the things that we have heard some questions, I just want to clear that up. What we are showing here, so cold hydro testing, have the ability to begin in June and conclude or actually, as of the November schedule, you could start as late as kind of in the fall. We really don\u2019t mean to suggest that, that is the duration of the test. The cold hydro test that is referring to the start of it, the cold hydro test itself has a duration of 19 or 20 days in total. That includes mobilization and takedown. The test itself is only 7 days long, okay. The other thing let me just do high functional test too. So the hot functional test from beginning to end total duration, mobilization to take down, is like two months. The hot functional test itself is only a month. Now we show you just major milestones. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that when we finish hot functional test we go right to fuel load. There is a few other things we\u2019re going to have to do. We have between cold hydro and hot functional, there is some leak tests and a variety of other things we will be doing. If you want a more complete picture of the VCM, I think it\u2019s on Page 24 of the filing has a detailed list of all those matters. Drew Evans : Julien, we\u2019ll give you a couple of interim data points as well. You\u2019ll see at the end of the first quarter our release on percent complete, which will help us better define what the start of cold hydro will be. There will also be testimony, both from ourselves and from staff-related to VCM before these events occur. And so there are a couple of interim data points that will give you a little bit better handle on it as we proceed. Tom Fanning : Let me add just a couple of things. You didn\u2019t ask this, but I am going to go ahead and offer it up in the spirit of this question and it really goes to you guys have often asked before, what do we worry about? And I think we have been pretty consistent on productivity, particularly electrical. We said reasonable, I think in the script here, a reasonable increase in productivity. We have been averaging kind of in the 28,000 hours per week. We expect to be able to achieve around 32,000. Remember and that\u2019s for Unit 3. And remember, we I think I have drawn for a lot of you all in one-on-one this graph. And I think we have included a similar graph somewhere in the appendix to the handouts, kind of how big the capital cost curve is right now, I guess, it\u2019s on Page 35, where we show that once we hit hot functional test, the exposure to cost variant logically should decrease pretty rapidly. If you go to Page 35, you\u2019ll see a reasonably quick slope and a really dramatic slope for Unit 4. That\u2019s because this graph shows both 3 and 4, alright. So we would expect to see any major cost variances occur right now. What do we worry about, what are the kind of big variances? One is hitting this electrical productivity, again, the increase for the next 6 months or so for Unit 3 from 28,000 hours a week to 32,000. We believe it\u2019s reasonable, because as we have said a lot and you look at this curve again, we are in the toughest period right now for electrical work. We are in that reactor vessel, it\u2019s confined areas. It\u2019s a lot of material and it\u2019s a lot of people. And so you would expect the productivity to be the worst that it should be right now. As we move out of the containment vessel into other areas of the plant, we open up scope, we open up area, we should see productivity improve. That\u2019s kind of thing one. Thing two that\u2019s on our mind right now, it\u2019s kind of next man up. Bechtel has a broad responsibility and has been doing a great job on this project. And I worked with Brendan Bechtel, he is a top guy, Jack [indiscernible] and the people beside are really good folks. One of their other areas of responsibility is system subcontracts. And we talked about that 2 years ago, but now is the time where subcontractors under the management of Bechtel and some with us have to perform and it\u2019s tough that you \u2013 it\u2019s not electrical and containment, it\u2019s things like coatings. It\u2019s the HVAC systems in the plant. It\u2019s insulation around the pipes where you have penetrations in walls. It\u2019s the ceiling of those penetrations and then fire protection and others. There is actually a big laundry list of stuff. But this is the next thing that we have to perform on. So, I know you didn\u2019t ask that. It\u2019s my executive caveat to answer a question that I asked, but I think it\u2019s important for everybody to understand, it\u2019s just a new phase in the project. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for all the details. Good luck. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hey, everyone. So you have already addressed \u2013 you addressed in the last you addressed my first question. My second one is about the outlook for demand, you were pretty clear that you have seen flat weather-normalized sales over the last 5 years. What gives you the optimism that it\u2019s going to be more like flat to up 1% going forward? Drew Evans : So, I think the issue I was actually I wanted to be specific in addressing was that we did see a decline in use per customer this year that seemed a bit exaggerated in my mind. And I think it mirrors a positive exaggeration in 2018. And so when you put those two things together we are a lot closer to smooth in terms of total net growth in total than any one of those two years would indicate. There are a number of folks in our sector that are expressing the same issue, which is that we are doing linear regression of weather normalization. And we\u2019ve seen two very extreme weather years that tend to kind of bend around the curves, not to get too statistical about it. But I think our precision with which we can measure in these two instances is not great. So your question was more around long term. As we do more long-term view of growth, we think it\u2019s quite strong in the southeast. We have seen a lot of in-migration into our area, particularly in Georgia. But we are seeing efficiency, and we\u2019re measuring the capacity for efficiency, particularly in our commercial segments. And so we do take some comfort that use per customer, although we\u2019ll be growing the customer count will be declining, but not with a full offset. That\u2019s a bit of a long-winded answer. We are also seeing industrial rebound. This is the third cycle within the last 12 years of growth cycle and we really do think that momentum is positive in the industrial segment maybe stand to that. Tom Fanning : Yes. I\u2019d like to geek out on all of it. The first derivative of all this is momentum. And in fact, we\u2019re seeing that. I\u2019ve told you before I think that momentum showed us bottoming out a little bit, but the momentum signals were flat to negative. They have just turned a wee bit positive, six positive, three negative, one flat. And I think what you are saying in English is tax law change, good; reduced regulation, good; currency wars, country trade wars, bad. And now all of a sudden, we see some green shoots out of some agreements with us in Mexico, for example, North America, also with China and there is still more to go. Now countervailing that and a little bit of headwind is the coronavirus. But as we have seen and we\u2019ve actually talked about this at the Fed before, with the kind of pandemic that we are seeing, assuming that we get control of it, those are reasonably shallow downturns and the recovery is pretty good. So we will see where this one takes us. But long-term, we think the fundamentals are still good, certainly, relative sense for the Southeast as compared to other places. Andrew Weisel : I appreciate you putting that into words. I can understand. It\u2019s very simple. My next one, next question and this is very, very minor, but you do have the comment that you will have new shares for long-term equity options incentive comp, what\u2019s the outlook for that, either in dollars or shares per year? Drew Evans : We only have about $350 million worth of options outstanding, Robinson came, it\u2019s actually a little bit lower than that, probably closer to $200 million and we don\u2019t control the exercise of those. But I know we know that the duration is no longer than I think 2024. And so we can\u2019t gauge the timing, but we know that it will happen sometime in that timeframe. Andrew Weisel : Okay, very minor. Thank you. Drew Evans : About $200 million is the dollar denomination of it. Andrew Weisel : Great. Drew Evans : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with ExodusPoint. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Andy. How are you? Andy Levi : Good. How are you? Tom Fanning : Awesome. Andy Levi : Just a question on cash flows, you have talked about earnings as you get further out in the $3.75 to $4 range. Again, that\u2019s not guidance, thinking about it, but just what will cash flows look like? How will they change from like where they are today to the \u201823, \u201824 timeframe as the plan stood up and running in the CapEx? Drew Evans : Yes. So there are bunch of different ways to think about this. In general though, Vogtle adds about $850 million of cash flow once it\u2019s fully embedded in rates. All of the other business units are driving at general increase in cash flow that\u2019s consistent. But if I look at this with respect to couple of things, payout ratio or FFO to debt, we are very credit conscious here in total. And I would say that both of those measures indicate improvement over the 5-year plan period that\u2019s measurable and substantial. That\u2019s the way we plan. Tom Fanning : Here again, Andy, we didn\u2019t ask this, but I just feel compelled to say this too. When we show our CapEx plan and all that, it is what we think we know. We don\u2019t have a bunch of placeholders in there. It\u2019s not pie in the sky numbers. There is an asset underlying everything that we are projecting here. Our experience has been that we tend to spend more in outer years, but we are just showing you exactly what we know. No placeholders. Andy Levi : So you are going to have $850 million of incremental net income or cash, right \u2013 not Net income, I am sorry, cash. And then depending on what the CapEx is maybe even a little bit more, let\u2019s call it, $1 billion, what do you do with that cash, pay down debt, do you or grow the dividend faster, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the balance sheet is just going to look like\u2026 Tom Fanning : Yes, it\u2019s all of that. I mean... Andy Levi : Do you buyback stock? What do you do with that $1 billion? And can you talk about longer term get it up to the board, but as far as once we get out of this building cycle, where would you envision the dividend growth rate to be once you get that pop in earnings and does the shareholder almost in a sense get a catch-up on the dividend? Drew Evans : First, Andy, as always, I appreciate your long-term perspective. It\u2019s very refreshing to think about the 2024s, \u201825s and \u201826s. I would say that we will talk with our board about the bookends of opportunity around free cash flow. And in general, we have been keeping the dividend growth slightly behind the expected growth of income in an effort to move our payout ratio down a little bit closer to the industry. We will achieve that within this plan period. And at that point, we will have a conversation about whether or not we grow dividends a pace with earnings or we, on the other hand, pay down debt to improve the credit quality of the corporation. I think that the reality lies someplace in between and that we will emphasize both of those activities when we have the ability at the end of Vogtle construction. Tom Fanning : Yes. And the other thing I would just say we say it all the time, value is a function of risk and return, improving your credit metrics as a lot of value to a value accretion as does increasing earnings. And so we will keep our eye on both of those things. The wonderful news is you are looking at a company that\u2019s going to be spinning off a boatload more cash, have much greater earnings potential and have little to no event risk. Andy Levi : I agree. Thank you very much. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hello, Ashar. Good afternoon. Ashar Khan : Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations. Tom, I am hoping with I guess this new phase, we can also return to the old phase when you were the CFO and when you gave guidance, you exceeded the \u2013 always achieved the top end in the 2000 years when you were the CFO. Can I assume that under this new, it\u2019s 2 years of good that we are back in that cycle, what whacked us that they followed you that you can be back in that cycle of as you project that you are losing towards the upper end of guidance every year going forward? Tom Fanning : Yes, those are all Southern people up there. Yes, look, we always have a conservative bearing to our earnings. That\u2019s the way we like it. We think we are on a great trajectory and we will be able to address. We put this 4% to 6% thing in place sometime ago and we think it\u2019s good \u2013 it\u2019s fit to be faithful to that. A lot of people have asked us, are you going to increase it? And certainly, if you look at a point estimate, 1 year going forward? Yes, sure. I mean, the math would show you that it would increase. Long-term, we will see. I think once we get out of the big project business, which I assumed when I got this job, we will be in a position, where as I just said, cash flow positive in a big way, earnings accretive in a big way, low event risk, we should be in a posture to continue to improve. Our recent performance, Ashar, first time, I think even when I was CFO we never said on a third quarter earnings call that we were going to exceed the range. We would always say something like, well, we expect to be at the very top of our range. We did exceed and we would have exceeded more, but for part of a settlement in the Georgia rate proceeding. Remember, we gave away some of the earnings above 12% as part of an overall really attractive global settlement. That was probably worth what, $0.04 or so this year. So I think look, we are going to do the best we can to under-promise, over-deliver, right now, our focus on getting Vogtle done. I would love to get back to those days. Drew Evans : I would only reiterate that we do, we are Ashar, under pressure this year because of penalty ROEs related to the construction of Vogtle, which is a single-minded focus for us. And then the only other thing I would do is absolutely affirm the fact that Tom was the CFO 2000 years ago. Ashar Khan : Thank you. Drew Evans : Ashar, you got anything else? Ashar Khan : No, thanks. Drew Evans : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to you. Tom Fanning : Hey, thank you. Thanks everybody. This is such an exciting time. And well, we said 2019 was such a heavy lift. You look back over that year, we had to scale up. Remember, we were all worried about getting people to the site and getting site productive and we did hit numbers like a 160,000 hours in a month and we did all of that stuff. I think we have refined the schedule going forward at somewhere between 140,000 and 145,000, we think we can do that. We are calling for a modest increase in electrical. We think we can do that. We have got to get subcontractors under Bechtel management to perform. We think we will do that. There is a long way to go here, but boy oh boy, we are starting to see the end of the tunnel. And I am so proud of the folks that work at Vogtle 3 and 4 and our partners, Bechtel on the site, good folks. So, we look forward and we are going to continue to work on that like crazy. But the other thing I don\u2019t want you to forget is that this company has been performing like champions outside of the major projects. This notion that now we are the best company to work for in the industry, 14th in the United States that we do so many good works in the community like the help to historically black colleges, like the work we are doing on the ESG front, like the folks that don\u2019t do rhetoric, we do solutions on the environmental and technology front. We are really trying to invent our future beyond just performing on the major project we have in front of us. This is I think what makes this company great. It\u2019s not a company run by a spreadsheet. Rather, it is a company run by a relentless focus on value as a function of risk and return and we try to balance both those issues in doing the best we can for shareholders going forward. Man oh man, 2020 could be just a great year and we are going through everything we can to make it that way. Thank you so much for being with us and we will talk to you soon. Operator, that\u2019s it. Operator : That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Nelson, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Southern Company's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's call is being recorded Thursday, April 30, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Nelson. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I hope that you're well. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the first quarter, ahead of our estimate. This solid start to the year positions us well as we look to overcome short-term sales impacts from the coronavirus. Drew will provide you with more detail on our financials momentarily, so I will go ahead and turn to our current operating environment, amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Southern Company, our top priority remains keeping every employee healthy and safe, while we continue to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customer. We were well prepared to quickly make necessary adjustments across our business activating internet response team throughout the company in February. We continue to execute COVID-19 pandemic plans for our business. And to-date, our operational performance has been exceptional. We have not experienced nor do we currently foresee supply chain disruptions for our utilities or our construction projects. We often talk about the importance of the reliability and resilience of our electric and natural gas infrastructure, which has delivered remarkably well during this time. In face of COVID-19, our biggest asset has really been the reliability and resiliency of our workforce. I want to thank our employees who have risen to every challenge. We have been resourceful and rapidly procuring and deploying necessary protective equipment and implementing effective protocols to safeguard against the virus. Our operations and customer service teams have continued to work around the clock. We are finding solutions to effectively work in teams remotely, and we are communicating with our workforce and external stakeholders in a whole new way. We've implemented a wide range of projects to support the physical, financial and emotional well being of our employees during this time as they continue their superb work to support the operation of our company. It's also a hallmark of our company to be a citizen wherever we serve. So we have worked to identify, how we can best assist our communities during these difficult times. Southern and its subsidiaries are targeting a commitment of nearly $10 million in financial -- I'm sorry, in foundation and charitable contributions. And our employees have logged thousands of volunteer hours to assist those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. I expect, we will do even more in the coming months. Let\u2019s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We remain focused on meeting the November '21 and November 2022 regulatory-approved in-service dates. And we continue to maintain an aggressive work plan on-site as a tool to help position us to meet those dates. Recall, in February, we refined the aggressive site work plan to reflect a May 2021 completion target for Unit 3 and a March 2022 completion target for Unit 4. We also laid out a November benchmark schedule and related milestone for Unit 3. Through March, production for Unit 3 was generally consistent with the refined aggressive site work plan. April's performance was challenged due to COVID 19 impact, which put us slightly behind the aggressive site work plan. Despite these challenges, today, direct construction is approximately 90% complete. And notably, just late breaking new, we have just completed open vessel testing. That came in about 1 p.m. today. We also reached several interim construction milestones for Unit 4 during the quarter, including the installation of the Polar train and setting the containment vessel topic. Before giving an update on recent productivity, I want to highlight our commitment to the safety of our workforce on-site and in the surrounding community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken a number of proactive measures intended to protect our workforce and the community against the spread of COVID-19. As we implement these measures, we\u2019ve engage independent medical advisors to guide our actions to reduce the possible spread of the virus. Among other measures, we have provided additional protective equipment, enhanced sanitation practices and implemented its social distancing strategy, such as spreading out and increasing common areas, eliminating group transportation at the site and mandating those who can tell a work to do so. Beyond these basics, early on, our protocol on-site ensured that anyone tested and their closed contacts will promptly self isolated off-site. We acted quickly to build an on-site medical clinic, designed to expedite test results, mineralize turn around time for close proximity screening and improved facilitation of clearing personnel to return to work. Throughout this time, we have remained in close consultation with the nuclear regulatory commission and the projects co-owners as well as local and state authorities. We are also consulting with and monitoring other mega projects. Notably last month, the President of the North American Building Trade Unions Commended Southern Company for going above and beyond the call of duty to keep their members on the Vogtle construction site, safe and healthy. Now turning to our recent progress. Although overall monthly production through March was largely consistent with the refined aggressive site work plan, mechanical, electrical and subcontract activities began to build a backlog to Unit 3 aggressive site work plan at the end of March. That trend was exacerbated through April, as we began experiencing impact across the site related to the coronavirus pandemic, including an increase in workforce absenteeism. Two weeks ago, in an effort to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, we announced our intent to reduce density on the site and take workforce down by 20%. As we work through this transition, we expect to see a decrease in near term production, similar to the sawtooth effects that we have experienced in the past. Longer term objectives is to gain operational efficiencies and productivity by reducing workforce fatigue and absenteeism. As we move ahead, we will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our streamlined workforce. As you know, we regularly evaluate both costs and schedule, and we have factored recent developments into our ongoing analysis. Looking first its schedule. We are prioritizing keyword fronts on Unit 3 and continue to work towards the aggressive site work plan targets, which have been pushed back slightly in light of recent events. The next major milestone for Unit 3 is the start of cold hydro testing, which is currently planned to occur in the June to July timeframe. Considering our expected timing on the start of cold hydro testing, we expect Unit 3 hot functional testing to commence in the August to September timeframe. On the assumption that we are able to stabilize and increase productivity to pre-pandemic levels, we are maintaining the aggressive site work plan targets of year end for Unit 3 fuel load. As a reminder, construction completion of about 2% per month is consistent with the aggressive site work plan. Taking into account our performance to date, we now project that we need to complete approximately 1% per month to meet the November benchmark schedule. Now, this is slightly down from the 1.3%, we discussed last quarter. Importantly, even amid the outbreak of the pandemic for April, our construction completion rate was about 1.25%, which supports meeting the November 2021 regulatory-approved in-service dates. Critical areas of focus remain electrical and subcontract performance. Lastly, consisting with the prioritization of Unit 3 and related staffing, we have shifted the target completion date on the aggressive site work plan for Unit 4 back to May 2022, which still provides six months of margin to the regulatory-approved in-service date. Recall, under the refined aggressive site work plan we laid out in February, we accelerated the target completion date for Unit 4 by two months to March. So the current action takes us back to the prior day of May, 2022. Turning now to cost. Based on our most recent assessment, there is no change in the total project capital cost forecast. In the first quarter of 2020, Georgia Power allocated an additional 66 million of its project contingency, reflecting cost risks associated with construction productivity, field support, subcontract and procurement, as well as the impacts of the April 2020 reduction in workforce. Recall the estimated cost of time between the aggressive site work plan and the regulatory-approved November in-service date or a schedule embedded in Georgia Power's based capital forecast. With this quarter's contingency allocation, the scheduled cost margin and the remaining cost contingency combined continue to represent approximately 20% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize the entirety of the contingency funds as we progress towards the completion of the project. The team at Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have worked incredibly hard to create an environment at the site that has led to meaningful progress over the past few months even while managing through this unprecedented pandemic. The next few months will be pivotal as we adjust to a smaller, more streamlined workforce and seek to improve productivity. The safety of our workforce and the surrounding community remains paramount and we continue to guide our decision making at the site. Importantly, we still expect to meet the November regulatory approved and service from both Units 3 and 4. Drew, I'll turn it over now to you for an updated on our financials and our outlook. Drew Evans : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everybody. I hope you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we have a very strong start to the year, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.78, which is $0.08 higher than last year and $0.06 above our estimate for the quarter. The primary driver compared to last year was constructive state regulatory actions, which were completed in 2019 at our utilities. In addition, through aggressive cost control, we were able to decreased non-fuel O&M year-over-year, which helped us overcome and hence an impact from warmer to normal weather in the first quarter. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in today's release and earnings package. Weather normalized retail sales for the first quarter 2020 were up slightly compared to last year led by our residential customer flats, with only modest impacts from COVID-19 evidence in the last two weeks of the quarter. We added over 20,000 new electric and natural gas customers across the system, which is consistent with our expectations. With COVID-19, top of mind, let's go ahead and turn our assessment of potential -- to the assessment of potential business impacts. While we did not see a meaningful earnings impact from COVID-19 in the first quarter, we are continually assessing potential financial impacts on our business. At this time, we do not expect coronavirus impact to materially affect our long-term outlook. Our expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 46%, our $40 billion five-year capital investment plan is unchanged, we do not foresee a need to issue equity for 2024, liquidity is strong with good access to the capital markets at both the parent and our subsidiaries. And with last week's announcements of $0.08 annual dividend increase -- the 19th consecutive annual increase we continue to demonstrate our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. As we think about the potential near-term impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 expectations our key focus areas are sales, bad debt expense and liquidity. Just a moment, I am going to switch microphones, so both can hear me better. Starting with sales, as I mentioned, whether normalized retail sales, were up slightly for the first quarter, slightly reflecting higher residential demand, at the end of March, as people begin to Tele working, thus far, in April, total estimated weather-normalized electric retail demand is lower than our forecast by approximately 8%. So April lows are historically volatile and customer switched between heating and cooling. We have seen demand stabilize at these approximate levels over the last few weeks. We'll continue to closely monitor trends, as businesses within our states begin to reopen. Looking ahead, we are basing our current forecast for 2020 on a U-shaped economic recovery that reflects a mid-summer phase out of the stay at home policies with modest economic recovery, across the service territories, over the balance of the year. Using these assumptions are projections indicate an overall defined retail sales, for the full year in a range of 2% to 5%, on or whether normalize basis whereas residential up 1% to 3%, commercial down 5% to 10%, and industrial down 4% to 8%. As a reminder, construction completion of about 2% per month is consistent with the aggressive site about each customer plans. Retail sales in these ranges with lower total non-critical electrical revenue by approximately $250 million to $400 million on a consolidated basis, we plan to mitigate these impacts by continuing to aggressively manage on them throughout the remainder of the year. While the current situation is unprecedented, we demonstrated a similar level of cost discipline in response to the 2008, 2009 recession, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver in the current environment. Of course, actual impacts will be highly dependent on the duration of stable polices and the pace of economic recovery. As visibility of these factors improves, we will hone our expectations around an appropriate level of cost control. At this time, we do not anticipate significant sales or financial impacts from COVID-19 on Southern power we're Southern Company gas. Due to the long-term contracted nature of Southern Power's business model, we expect it to be largely insulated from pandemic impacts. Southern Company Gas has already achieved roughly half of its expected full year net income, in the first quarter. And we expect earnings over the remainder of the year to be consistent with our forecast. In addition to sales, we are also assessing the potential for an increase in bad debt expense. Specifically, our electric utilities, utilities, sellers most around the country are not disconnecting customers for non payment. And we are temporarily waiting late payment fees. Our states regulators are taking these defer incremental bad debt expenses related to this pandemic for recovering future -- recovery in future rate proceedings. In addition, our gas utilities are largely decoupled and may have bad debt and may have bad debt mechanisms already in place, which helped to insulate them from both sales and non-payment impacts. We also expect increased federal funding for programs like lightning and certain provisions in the TTC program to assist eligible customers with built in. Including regulatory mechanisms and customer assistance programs, we believe that expensive acts will be largely mitigated. Turning now to liquidity depend on the actions we took in the first quarter, Southern's net liquidity at the end of March -- by $800 million relative to year-end 2019 and currently stands at over $7 billion. In the second quarter, we have already taken steps to further strengthen our liquidity position, including completion of a $1 billion issuance with a parent in April. At this juncture, we believe we have ample liquidity for Apple [ph] investment plans, protect our dividends, and weather potential COVID-related volatility in debt markets, as well as elevated [ph] periods of customer non-payment With solid results through the first quarter, our current belief is that O&M reductions can largely offset pandemic-related sales impacts with peak electric loads still to come, we see no reason to deviate from our current financial objectives. Consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year, relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter. For the second quarter, we assume that pressure on retail sales will persist, so it is too early to predict with precision like the overall [indiscernible], recognizing all of these factors, we are providing adjusted EPS for the second quarter of $0.55. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to give a brief update on some regulatory matters. In March, the Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved the rate settlement breach between Mississippi Power and TSP staff [ph], resulting in a rate decrease for customers, and an increase in the allowed equity ratio for Mississippi Power of 55%. On the global front, we filed DCM 22 [ph] with Georgia PSC in mid-February, requesting verification and approval of $674 million spend of the period of July through December of 2019. We expect a decision from PFC in August. Before I turn it back to Tom, I\u2019d like to thank our Southern family for an outstanding job during this period. Everyone has taken the new normal and stride has remained focused on our customer at all levels. You've shown superior performance and total commitment. I hope everyone stays well, and with that I'll turn it back to Tom. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Drew. As our nation seeks a path to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, at Southern Company, we are resolute in our commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for your customers. To ensure that we are actively supporting recovery efforts, Southern Company and our subsidiaries are engaged with policymakers at both the State and Federal level as they make critical decisions about reopening our economies. Notably, Alabama Power's CEO, Mark Crosswhite and I were named as part of the President's Economic Revival Initiative. Along with the work that I do to help lead the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, the principal liaison between the federal Government and the electric power industry, which has been heavily involved in pandemic recovery efforts. Southern Company continues its leadership at a national level. Before we take your questions, I also want to highlight the extraordinary response of our teams after the recent severe storms. In April, we experienced two successive weekends of devastating tornadoes across our Southeast service territories that damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses. Our employees on the frontlines worked tirelessly to restore service to the thousands of electric and natural gas customers that were affected by these storms. In the aggregate, we restored service to over 600,000 customers within 24 hours, improved our capacity to work under duress effectively with coronavirus protocols. I am grateful for and extremely proud of the men and women of Southern Company, who continue to work hard each day to deliver value to customers and shareholders during these extraordinary times. In closing, the COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the U.S. and global economies and on communities we serve. Under what we currently view as a reasonable economic recovery scenario, we are positioning ourselves to mitigate potential financial impacts on our company through aggressive and thoughtful cost control. The next several months will be particularly instructive for Southern and our utilities as we monitor the pace of recovery, move into the warm summer season and work to increase productivity at Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We expect our business will remain reliable and resilient over the long-term in keeping with our long history of delivering on our commitments to customers, employees and shareholders. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hello, Shar. How are you? Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good. How are you doing? Tom Fanning : Great. Shar Pourreza : So just a couple of questions here. First, just sort of, thinking about some of the moving pieces. We're looking at COVID sales impact for a 2% to 5 % reduction versus prior guidance of flat to up 1%, better-than-expected Q1, slightly weaker Q2 guidance versus, I guess, expectations, OEM lever. We're assuming kind of normal weather, where do you see coming in within your earnings guidance range for the year? And then just remind us the sales growth figures for March and April on slide 11. Are they weather normalized, especially with the recent storms in your jurisdictions. How do we extrapolate, how much of that was weather versus COVID versus anything else? Tom Fanning : So with respect to the first question, when we set a guidance range, I think, you know, we broadly think that kind of the midpoint of the range is a place that without all these other impacts we do that we would expect to land. I think we remain consistent with our financial objectives for the year. You know, I will add, I know we received some conversation about should we reaffirm. Let me just hit that real quick. It has never been our practice to reaffirm guidance in interim periods. We give you guidance in -- at the end of the year so that would be late January, February. And then once we get through our peak kind of earnings season, which would be the third quarter that\u2019s one when we give a update as to our guidance. We believe we're committed to hitting our financial objectives. Of course, there is uncertainty in front of us, and we run the same uncertainty everybody else does. But with what we know right now with reasonable impacts, we remain committed to everything that we've said so far. So we are sticking with that. I think further evidence of that is the recent increase in dividend.  Shar, what else did you want there? Shar Pourreza : Sorry, just the weather on slide 11, the impacts that you have from March through April. How much is that weather normalized, and how much of it is impacted from COVID versus the recent storms? Drew Evans : That is weather normalized. So virtually all open. Shar, I think I have just addressed one other piece of your question related to our guidance strong estimate for second quarter. Second quarter typically is a relatively light quarter for us in terms of total demand and you can imagine that there's a big difference between June\u2019s expectation and April's expectation. We also feel like this is the period where COVID-19 is going have the greatest amount of impact across the retail customer base, whether it's residential, commercial or industrial. And even though we are putting measures in place to reduce expenses, those will largely be over the balance of the period and you're looking some adjusted to what is a very constrained quarter in terms of sales. So I would just take it in that light. Also, if you look at last year, I think we reported $0.18 for the quarter, $0.18 of that mix was weather related. So I think what we're putting out consistent with what we've already reported for the first quarter is Tom Fanning : Yes, Drew, thanks for that. I actually went back over the last eight years and just look at what did we estimate. And believe it or not, this is within the range of estimates. The kind of low was 65. In fact, I want to say, in 2018, we estimate it $0.65. And when you consider you have the effect of the covirus -- the coronavirus impact, who knows, but it seems like a reasonably conservative estimate for -- from my standpoint. I'm okay with it Shar Pourreza : Got it. And just on Vogtle, given the impact of COVID and the move to push the aggressive unit foresight plan back to May from March, I know we've in the past, we've talked about being hopeful that we could see the units come online somewhere between the budgeted and the more aggressive time lines. Is that kind of not reality at this point? And I know you will continue to keep that May aggressive schedule until there's zero probability it could be met. What probabilities are the site managers placing now on meeting the aggressive schedule and at what point could you move away from May to something closer to the midpoint between the aggressive and budget as schedule? Thanks. Tom Fanning : Shar, let me pick it. One of the predicates in your question, and that was until there's zero probability. That's really not the case. We've kind of do a reasonable shot, and we stick with that. Look, we have used some margin here. We had an extra month of kind of hidden margin between hot functional test and fuel load. Essentially, we have seen so far losing kind of 10 days to 14 days in the aggressive schedule. We think through May, we'll lose another two weeks. The site people are going to work like crazy to mitigate the loss of that month. But we had a month of, if you will, margin in between now and fuel load that we're just consuming. Is it riskier than it was before? Yes. But it's still a reasonable objective. Otherwise, we wouldn't stick with it, okay? One last point. When we go from in the schedule from fuel load to in-service, recall, we have maintained -- and I know this has been a conversation in many earnings calls. We have maintained a six-month schedule there. China did it in 4.5 months, and we think we can meet or beat China. So we actually have a little more margin even to November and to May. So look, November is what matters. We got to beat November, and our eyes are on that. The site continues to believe they can hit a May schedule. Has it gotten more aggressive? Yes, still is a reasonable shot at it. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Congrats guys on the results and stay safe, and we'll see you soon. Tom Fanning : Sure. Thanks. Same to you, bud. Shar Pourreza : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hey, Tom. Good afternoon. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon. Steve Fleishman : So a couple of questions. So the -- has the workforce reduction been implemented now? And did it end up being around 20% that took that plan? Tom Fanning : Yes. Yes. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And is it -- okay. And is it -- maybe just give some color on -- obviously, there's different people doing different things there. Are there areas where you need to refill people for certain skills? Or just how does that play out? Tom Fanning : Yes. In general, what we were able to do is to bring people off of four on to three. That's how we filled whatever gaps we thought we may see. Recall, and this was in the 8-K, I think, the first reduction was voluntary. And then we moved to what we call rightsizing. So the voluntary effort didn't produce an optimal kind of result for all the work phases that we have at the plant. And remember, as I said in the script and everything else, we're particularly concerned with getting the right mix and the right productivity in electrical and with subcontracts. And so what we did by moving resources away from four, we bolstered the mix on unit three, so that we believe that there's a reasonable shot to maintain the aggressive schedule, which has a May in-service date. So that really is what has happened. Now, the other thing I just want to put out is that, we are in transition. In the script, I mentioned, the idea about this sawtooth effect. And we've seen that every time now, and those of you that follow these calls will remember, that every time we open up a new workforce - a new work phase in the plant, every time we lead to an increase in personnel, well, and now, even with the decrease in personnel as we may mix crews and schedules and everything else. We believe that sawtooth effect will occur. And so, that's why we're being reasonably conservative with May. In other words, we did 1.25% in April, would still beat the 1% that we need for November. May maybe similarly challenged. We hope it's a little better, but don't be surprised if it's not that great. But then we expect in June and beyond to really pick up the sawtooth effect and achieve what we want to do, as we have done in the past. So, when we've talked to you about sawtooth effect in the past, in fact, it has occurred. So let us readjust, get the teams right, get the work practices back together and then we think we'll get the performance we want to see. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then, when will we kind of get an update of how the Commission is kind of feeling about how Vogtle is going? Is that -- would that be in this VCM or really the next one? Are they going to do any special hearing on it? Tom Fanning : Yes. Well, let me answer that a couple of ways. Steve, I know you're really good about this and others on the call are in terms of contacting the Commission directly or looking at all the filings and everything else. So you have heard directly kind of from the Commissioner himself, I would never put words in their mouth. But the other thing that I would just highlight to people is that Tuesday, so just a few days, the company will be testifying. And you'll be able to see the interplay between the company and the staff and everybody else. And so we'll get some illumination there. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then my last question is just on -- just making sure I understand the assumptions for sales. And when you talk about kind of start-up later in the summer and then recovery, is recovery kind of off of this very low level now? Or when you're talking about recovery, what do you mean by that? Drew Evans : Steve, actually, can you hear me all right? We're having some technical difficulties, as Tom and I socially distance. Steve Fleishman : I hear you well. Drew Evans : Good. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Drew Evans : We're modelling a bunch of different things, whether it's V, U, W or L, In general, the midline of our sort of 250 to 400 is probably something like delayed re-emergence from stay-at-home kind of through mid-summer, maybe even until August and then some recovery through the balance of the year, but certainly not complete. If we look at the different customer classes that we're tracking today, I mean, our industrial segment, which is not the largest contributor to earnings, by the way, is actually performing quite well, but it is very. And so things like pulp and paper, some of the larger segments, chemical, are doing quite well because of low input cost because of demand on product. Some of the things like precursors to automotive or light still are going to take a little bit longer to rebound. But those industries as we're watching are starting to reopen and automotive production is beginning to restart across Georgia and Alabama, in particular. On the commercial side, we've seen a pretty exaggerated decrease. Some of our bigger customers there are certainly in retail and education, but some of those segments are starting to move back. And so I think the 2% to 5% total that we gave you really represents those different actions in aggregate, but we're looking at it in a pretty detailed way. Tom Fanning : And I'll just add to that, too. So everybody, I think, knows that Georgia is one of the states stepping out on re-emerging. Of course, we're doing it in a thoughtful phased process. The other issue that I would put out there is fuel prices are really low. For the quarter, natural gas was $1.88 per million BTU. And I think the amount of natural gas cost borne by customers was around $250 million -- $247 million lower than last year. So cost of electricity, and therefore, consumption of energy is more cost-efficient than it has been before. There's a lot in the mix right now. And also, I'll just say that been in contact with my friend, Jay Powell from the Fed, I would complement, and I know there's all kinds of disagreement about this, but I would complement broadly the federal response, whether it's the administration, whether it's Congress, whether it's the Fed, in terms of the timeliness of their response and supporting the economy, especially as compared to, say, 2008, 2009, these guys are on top of it. And I'm sure we can all criticize one step here or there. But I think all the necessary chemicals are in the sea to produce something that will minimize hopefully the impact going forward. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Steven. How are you? Stephen Byrd : Hi, good afternoon. Good. I just wanted to follow-up on the status of COVID at the Vogtle work site. And you've taken steps to reduce risk. Is there -- we're trying to sort of track the number of cases. Is there a risk of a trajectory of more cases such that you have to sort of adjust work practices at the site further? Or do you feel that sort of the changes you've made have made the impacts to the number of cases that you were looking for? Tom Fanning : No. In fact, look, we started very early on before there were any COVID-19 effects, we were planning that there would be. And one of the very first things we did, I remember it was a weekend all of the executive team, was to move to the site, essentially of medical village staff by nurses and doctors, we have a disease specialist that's been advising the site daily. We have all the PPE we need. We have turnaround and testing conservative work practices. And in fact, on realization, I kind of -- we've debated about talking about this on the call, but I'll throw a little bit of it out there. Our incidence rate compared to the utility industry is about half, maybe 40%, something like that. Our severity of cases is way low. One of the very smart steps that the site did very early on was to remove from the site at least on a voluntary basis with pay, people that would be most likely to be severely impacted. That is elderly or older. Look, I'm probably that category. I don't want to describe myself as elderly and if they had a pre-existing condition. So if you look at it, one other thing we do that's very conservative that other people aren't doing. That is, if somebody at the site just feels funny, if they don't feel well and want to get tested, we get them tested. Not only that, we take their work associates out that have the close contact and we test them. When you look at the amount of testing per person at the site relative to anywhere in the community we serve, it is somewhere we are testing between five and 10 times more people then what's being tested elsewhere in the region. So it's amazing stuff. So sometimes in these close contact cases, we will test somebody that is asymptomatic, oh, ensure they turned up positive, we removed them. And the other kind of telling factor is severity. I think we've only had one or two people be hospitalized or go to a hospital. Otherwise, they're being tested with the folks on-site and about half of the people that have been tested positive have returned to work. I think that's all pretty positive stuff. A couple more things that we're doing. At any work front, we limit the amount of people doing the social distancing to three per work site. So sometimes, we exceed that with everybody's approval, but that generally is the practice. We have eliminated close quarters great areas, close quarter lunch areas, the big bussing, and all that stuff. We really have worked hard right away early on to make sure and the principle was that we wanted Plant Vogtle 3 and 4 to be a better environment for the workers there than what they could find elsewhere in their homes or in their communities in the surrounding area. And I think we\u2019ve done that. Stephen Byrd : That's really helpful color. Thank you very much. And just checking in on the status of just equipment testing on the site, would you mind just giving a high-level update on, I guess, maybe percentage of equipment tested or whatever else is most relevant as we think about just sort of overall status of testing all the equipment on site? Tom Fanning : Well, all the major equipment is tested, right? So in fact, it was -- I mean, right as we entered the call, we got to sign off from Westinghouse. The open vessel testing, the testing was complete. Just as you get your children and teenagers, check your work before you turn it in. That's what we have been doing in the past, just recent day hours, whatever. And in fact, we just got clearance from Westinghouse. And in fact, we had -- they had verified that we had passed all the tests on OVT. So, we were very happy to announce that today. I don't know how -- what else would you want to hear? Stephen Byrd : Well, I think that makes sense. I think in the past, there was some sort of metric of percentage of equipment that's been inspected. But I can follow-up afterwards. Tom Fanning : I'd say all the major equipment is there and has been tested. We'll test it again once it goes into a system, but we're done. Drew Evans : Hey, one other thing, the RCP, right, is all on-site and everybody admires it as they walk by it. It's a spare. We got that from Summer. Stephen Byrd : Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Thanks for joining us. Durgesh Chopra : Thanks Tom. Thanks for taking my question. Just -- I want to take you back to '08, '09. You mentioned you were able to offset a lot of the impact there with cost cuttings. But also, I believe it was Georgia and correct me if I'm wrong, were you were able to amortize some of the regulatory accounts to kind of mitigate the earnings hit there? Is that sort of an opportunity available this time around? Tom Fanning : Well, you've got a great memory, and you're correct. That is, in fact, what we did. We took some steps to lessen the burden, but we don't feel the need to take those steps right now. Those are certainly options in the future to approach regulators if we need to. The one thing I think that you can just point to around the system is that I think we've received -- in fact, I would just go broadly. Our PSCs, but also, I would say, FERC and NERC at the national level, folks have really, I think, spent over backwards to accommodate the needs of this unique environment. And I think the issue of being able to set aside as a regulatory asset recovery of disconnect costs and a variety of other things has been another evidence of constructive practice by our states. And at the NERC and FERC level, I'll tell you, they've been on these ESCC calls like. Likewise, they're doing what they need to do in order to help the industry get through this period. Not by imposing over regulations, et cetera. I'm very complementary of what are generally very tough regulators taking constructive approaches to help in assisting through this time frame. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just shifting gears, and can you talk a little bit about the credit metrics and you're really confident in your 2020 EPS numbers, but I'm just kind of curious as to what impact, if any, are you seeing or do you expect to see on your FFO to debt versus the targets? And any color on any dialogue you may have had with the credit rating agencies? Drew Evans : This is Drew. I would say that we've had numerous conversations with the credit rating agencies across a variety of topics and did a very fulsome review of each of those individual business units, not 4 weeks ago. While we're meeting targets, FFO debt doesn't change much. Our goal is to sort of stay with a buffer relative to what's expected for the ratings categories that we maintain. And generally, as we get through the construction of Vogtle that are on an improving trajectory, which is a function really of just how the economics work of Vogtle. The other thing that we've been working through is general liquidity, which we think is Paramount operating a well-functioning business. And we were fortunate to be good credit in good reasonable markets, and we accelerated all of the debt issuance that we needed to do for the balance of the year, at least for ourselves in a position to not have to face those challenges later on. So I think very comfortable with how we're managing liquidity and credit in total. Tom Fanning : Yes. And Drew, I'm just going to ask you if you're comfortable saying something here, but our relationship with not only our regulators, but also the rating agencies, etcetera, is continuous, not discrete. And just recently, you went through a pretty intensive review by the rating agencies. What can you say about their response to that? Drew Evans : Just as you would expect and probably very similar to 2008 and 2009 that they have sectors that they worry about far more than utility. I think they're focused on is are the constructive and proactive nature of regulators and the behaviors that we've seen insulating us from things like bad debt expense, I think, is a very protective and productive thing. But in general, the rating agencies are still concerned with the same thing they were concerned with before. But I think, certainly, our sector is less of a concern than most others. Tom Fanning : And I think we got a favorable review from them? Drew Evans : Yes. Durgesh Chopra : Okay, perfect guys. Really appreciate you taking the time to answer our questions today. Thank you very much. Drew Evans : Yes sir, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Drew Evans : Hello Sophie. Sophie Karp : Good afternoon. Congrats on a solid quarter, and thank you for squeezing me in here. Drew Evans : Absolutely. Sophie Karp : Yes. A lot of the questions have been asked and answered, but maybe if I can just follow-up on a couple of points here. So firstly on Vogtle, right, you mentioned that you reduced the size of teams to three people, I think you said, and the overall workforce by 20%. And is that based on kind of CDC guidelines or your internal guidelines that you've developed? And like when may you go back to like larger teams or reduce this because, obviously, it would be fair to say, I believe that this is causing some productivity declines, right? So is that sort of a new normal duration of the projects in your mind? Or are we going to go back to like more normal staffing at some point? Tom Fanning : Yes. Sophie, that's a great question. So if you recall, the -- I think we've done this in the past, kind of CapEx by quarter, we've jumped these curves. We're kind of at the peak of our curve. And assuming that we continue to be productive, the curve actually starts to turn down on Unit 3. Now, it'll ramp up a little bit more on Unit 4 going forward. So, my sense is we're going to evaluate our progress in the months ahead. But it could be that this level of activity is appropriate for where we want to be on Unit 3 and 4. We were on the downturn of activity at Unit 3, just right there. So, dropping the whole site from nine to seven isn't exactly unexpected. It's a little accelerated, which means that we're probably going to push out some hours. But it's not unexpected and we didn't intend it when we refinanced the schedule the refinement we did in February, but accelerating for those two months gave us essentially a bank of more margin that we're able to use and moving people from 4 to 3 to accommodate the difference in the resizing after this voluntary reduction. So, it's actually not a bad place to be. Let's see what happens in the months ahead. Sophie Karp : And then my other question was on bad debt expense, right. And we're pretty early I guess in this as far as the wind cycles go, but is there a point where it might be an issue for the balance sheet that you might want to approach the regulators to maybe cover it before the next rate case cycle which is now sometime away? I guess, how do you think about it internally? What is the threshold, if any? Drew Evans : So, Sophie, this is Drew. I'd say a number of things. In general, our gas utilities have riders or trackers for these types of things and so our exposures were probably more isolated the electric utilities. We've had very constructive regulatory conversations. And in fact, not so much in mechanism, but at least an understanding that bad debt expense would track through regulatory assets that we could recover when we get together next to discuss rates. Your question, I think was around the interim period. And to be honest, bad debt expense is not one of the things that I fear. It's a relatively low percentage of our total revenue. The thing that we're tracking really is sort of for late payment of bills. And so we've been monitoring the number of customers in arrears. It has not changed materially over the last month. We typically have about 15% of our customers in arrears in any given time any more than a normal time and we know that if we were to happen provisions is something like a 40% of our customers being in arrears that we would probably have to provision somewhere between $800,000 and a $1 billion worth of additional capital per quarter. All of that is incredibly management, all within the existing liquidity that we have within the business. And so we don't anticipate that they'll be anything more than maybe some temporary impacts of liquidity, but really no long term impact to bad debt. Tom Fanning : Yes, and let me let me add another comment. It's under the -- who knows, but I think it's still something we've talked about getting ready for the call. And that is when you think about the intensive impact of COVID-19, it's occurring during light revenue month for us. It's occurring during April in May, which are not strong month. This is Atlanta, particularly, but the southeast is known for these beautiful long springs and our big revenue month -- 60% of our revenue, I think, comes out of the summer. So that's going to be -- so when you think about the intense impact is coming during low revenue, and therefore, if we have some recovery, that's the who knows part, that will get us back to, I think, a good spot. Hey, Sophie, one more thing you mentioned, somebody pointed out to me that I didn't cover, you said, do we follow CDC guidelines? In fact, yes, we do. And in fact, I think we're even more conservative than CDC in terms of recovery and all that stuff. We keep people out 14 days, even if they've been around somebody that's been tested, a variety of other things. One other thing. Yes, just one last thing. We do survey. We do stay in touch with the other megaprojects around the U.S. and their experience is not that different than ours. I think 95% are still progressing kind of as we are. Sophie Karp : Great. Thank you, Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Michael Weinstein : Hey, Tom. How you doing? Tom Fanning : How you doing? Michael Weinstein : On residential sales, it looks like your forecast is about 1% to 3% open. It is a little bit light as a forecast for up compared to what I've been hearing from other utilities, range of 3% to 4% for residential sales. Is there something about residential sales that you expect to be a little more, I guess, not as enthusiastic about it an offsetting factor? Tom Fanning : No, Michael, I think probably what you're noting maybe a difference in time period, we're -- the 2% to 3% that we've got on our churn on slide 11 really is meant to represent what we think the full year impacts might be. We certainly are seeing across all of these classes, commercial, industrial and residential, more exaggerated response than what's depicted here. What we're trying to show is just that this is what we think the full year impact would be given the point in time we're the point in the heating and cooling cycle, where we are today. And as Tom said, April is sort of an interesting month in Georgia, people are starting to change over from heating into air conditioning and so demand is quite light. What we expect in May is a fraction of what we expect in June. Drew Evans : And August and September here are crazy. Michael Weinstein : Right. [Technical Difficulty] Tom Fanning : Where are they manufactured? Did you say -- you're breaking up. Did you say where is the fuel manufactured? Michael Weinstein : Yes. Tom Fanning : South Carolina, Michael Weinstein : [Technical Difficulty] Tom Fanning : Yes. I'm sorry, you're breaking up. What would -- I'm sorry, you're really breaking up. But what we hear is, where is the fuel manufactured in it South Carolina. Michael Weinstein : Are there any issues on-site or manufacturing process? Tom Fanning : Is there any fuel on-site? No. That will -- Michael Weinstein : [Technical Difficulty] Tom Fanning : No, no. Michael Weinstein : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes, Michael, thank you. If we missed your question there, please call us after, and we'll be glad to hit it for you. You were just breaking up a lot. Michael Weinstein : Thank you. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hello, Jeremy. How are you? Jeremy Tonet : Good. Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. Tom Fanning : You bet. Jeremy Tonet : I wanted to come back to Vogtle here a little bit, if I could. And with the lower Vogtle workforce, I was just wondering, what type of working hours per week are you guys achieving now? And kind of what levels would have a concern with regards to the schedule? Or ask definitely what type of working hour numbers do you guys need to see to hit that monthly completion rate of about 1%? Tom Fanning : Yes, I think we're on 510s. And then we don't do as many weekends as we have. So we backed off a little bit. That gives us a little bit of optionality should we need to work weekend. So we backed-off a little bit during this timeframe and less density and everything else. Further, we have shifted more work into the daylight hours as opposed to the night shift. And we have shifted more hours on to Unit 3. So, that's kind of the broad approach there. Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful, and thanks. And just want to shift gears I guess, to load and appreciate that it might be just well too early to tell. But it seems like a Georgia has recently started to reopen a bit here. With that process started just wondering if you could share anything you're seeing with us live time. And was that able to inform kind of your load projections that you provided early on the call? Tom Fanning : Well, look, we're in contact with our key account customers. I think we always do a pretty good job there. And let the estimate stay where the estimates are. So, you have a little bit of a different question kind of what's our pulse of the community. I think there is a positive vibrate right now, that people are trying to figure out ways to start again the restaurants. They are doing all this takeout. It just -- it feels a little better. Drew is in a different part. He lives right in the heart of the city. I live in the burbs. What's kind of your experience? Drew Evans : Well, another way to sort of think about this is we have real time data on actual usage. And then as you described, Tom, we have four polling of all of our commercial and industrial customers. And I would say that the fact that the governor has opened the state has not changed human behaviour materially. But I would say that in general, as we pulled commercial customers in particular, confidence around coming back as load as has improved in the last couple of weeks, the last set of data that I saw out of Georgia in particular. But these are just sort of early chutes kinds of signs. And we'll have to look at what the actual demand is. We certainly have some categories where we don't expect any immediate improvement. Education is one of our top virtual segments and we don't anticipate people being back in school for this season. Then there are other loads like hospital, where they have exceeded historical consumption. That's to be expected. So, I just give us a few more -- few more months, we'll be able to give you a little bit better daily. Jeremy Tonet : But Drew, you reminded me to -- I think you guys have time. It\u2019s interesting. Drew is on the board, probably half the hospital beds in the State here in Georgia anyway, and his wife is a doctor. Give a sense as to how many of the beds are being used because this is kind of this capacity flatten the curve concept? Drew Evans : Yes. It\u2019s -- I probably have to stay away from absolute numbers. And I prefer that some of these institutions report for themselves. I would just say that I am intimate with the functioning of Emory and Grady sort of safety in hospital, our academic institutions in town. I'm incredibly amazed their ability to ramp to an expected demand. And in general, I think that we're seeing cases in those hospitals that are a little bit lighter than models were projected. But the ability of those hospitals to grasp to accommodate them, what could be a crush there has been really incredible, very sophisticated institutions in our area. Tom Fanning : So we have 100% more capacity than what we're seeing in terms of actual cases right now. So when you think about coming back to work, there's a whole lot of gating issues that we've been working on. I've been working on in a national level in the industry and here at Southern. One of the big indicators is, have we flattened the curve? Do you have capacity? Yes. The fact is, and I think it's been very instructive at Vogtle that we have to learn to work with the virus. We have to learn for American Commerce to get along, because the only way you can be assured you don't have the virus is to have widespread available vaccines, and we don't have that yet. Until we get there, you won't have complete recovery. So how do you act? How are you able to persist in this environment? And I think that's why -- I mean, who knows, but I think that's why Governor Kemp that was one of the issues he was looking at, do we have available capacity? Yes. The next question we will all have as a nation is, do we have a second wave later this fall? We'll see. Jeremy Tonet : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you for taking my question. Tom Fanning : Yes, you bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hello, Paul. Glad to have you with us. Paul Fremont : Hey, great to be here. Hope you're all safe and healthy. Tom Fanning : Yes, we're great. Paul Fremont : You had initially planned turnover and testing to occur simultaneous with construction. Is that still the plan? And does COVID-19 complicate this due to the small footprint of the plant? Tom Fanning : Turnover and testing a construction have been going hand in glove along the way. We get thorough reports. I know we do thorough reports once a month with everybody at the PSC and the co-owners and everything else, that's going according to pace. And sometimes you speed up testing. Remember, we got into a discussion about that in past calls. Sometimes you slow it down, letting construction catch up, or you test in other areas of the plant while you focus on construction in a particular area. All that's going as expected. I wouldn't say that's anything other than exactly what we've expected. And I think this approach has really served us well. We've talked about that in the past, but fail fast and learn in other areas has been really helpful to us. Paul Fremont : And then secondly, can you update us on how many final approvals you've had from the NRC on ITAC? And are you going to have to wait until construction is fully complete for a lot of the remaining ITACs to be signed off on? Or how should we think about the time frame for that? Tom Fanning : Yes. Let me just give you a quick numbers. The ITACs that have been submitted, all the UIN, so this is the ITACs that have been submitted in form without the number. Have been accepted by the NRC, so every one of those. So that really lessen the bow wave that we have. We had originally, I think, 449 ITACs fully that need to be submitted for Unit 3. And we've had a whole lot of those complete. I guess, we still have about 270 left before they're certified and we get the clearance to load fuel. That's been going well. Let me just -- yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Paul. Paul Fremont : I was going to just ask for the 270 to be approved. Do you essentially have to wait until construction is complete? Are you expecting that to happen, earlier? Tom Fanning : There's, it's a pace along the way. There is some elements of the 270 that are after construction. But we think it's, ITACs are going well. We're either ahead of schedule or whatever. Paul, you may remember, I used to say that ITAC would reach my top three of concerns. And while we're concerned about everything, I think, electrical work and subcontract work, are much bigger concerns at this point in our ability to deliver on ITAC. I really think those guys have done great. And I want to throw a bouquet to the NRC. They have staffed up appropriately. And the teams that have been charged with approving the UINs and the ITAC that are fully complete have done a very timely job of doing that. I personally have worked with Steve Kaczynski [ph] and team visiting with the NRC commissioners, and they are committed to holding up their end of the bargain. I feel I feel good, it's still a big issue. Let me not minimize it. But it's something I feel pretty good about. Drew Evans : Good. Tom, I think the only thing that I add is we try to emphasize with folks is this testing and turnover approve constantly, and the best indicator that we're making progress on testing the turnover on the actual starts of the milestones themselves. So you'll see a couple of those milestones that are progressed against the summer. That's the best indicator you can have a successful customer turnover. Tom Fanning : Yes, and it's just been following you know, I forget. I did -- we do these -- variety of these town halls. I did one with Shar recently and sometime ago with Weissman [ph]. And sure enough back then I said end of the month well, we finished OBT end of the month. So we're able to follow through on the schedule despite the challenges of COVID. Paul Fremont : And then after implementing the 20% workforce reduction, are you anticipating a significant improvement in productivity at the plant? Tom Fanning : Yes, yes. And you just got to remember the sawtooth discussion, we've had before. Anytime we staff up or now staff down we have to right-size and bring new people on and, you know, getting used to a new work front and new people working together and new supervision. There always is a bit of a learning curve. That's a sawtooth. Yes, we are expecting an improvement. But let me point out again, we have been at, I think, the chart on slide 7 really shows it, but even with April, it's just a slight down tick from our aggressive schedule. And I think pretty far away from November. Even during April, we completed 1.25%, target was 2%. The November scheduled called for 1%. So we even made some margin to November even during a bad month. Paul Fremont : And then my last question looking, sort of, it's at your slide 11 with respect to potential cost reduction, where in relation to the 250 million to 400 million of potential revenue erosion? Where would you see the ability to, sort of, offset that with O&M towards the lower end, the middle, the high end? How should we think about that? Drew Evans : Well, I think we're going to have to see how this quarter goes. But we're going to put plans in place, at least give us bookends to achieve at either end of the spectrum is the simple way I describe it to you. There are certainly costs that we will categorize that are things where you reduce the absolute on the run expense them, travel, entertainment or travel, in particular, is perfect example. Workforce of nearly 30,000 people, very few people were travelling for a number of months. We don't expect that, that creates a backlog of travel that will then come back into our cost ratting. There will be things for the far end of the spectrum where we will be delaying expenses into future periods. And so we're just going through an effort to identifying both of those categories and across this entire spectrum of potential revenue declines, how we might function in either -- with either of these outcomes. Tom Fanning : We're not -- as a principle, we're not refilling open jobs without CEO approval, which really freezes them. And has the effect of a freeze. Paul Fremont : I mean, are there sort of examples of like past years, where you've gone through cost reduction and any numbers that you can share based on past experience? Tom Fanning : Yes, go ahead. Drew Evans : So 2008 and 2009, I think the number was probably a little bit towards the lower end of this range, but I think a pretty good indication of what the capabilities are, understanding the 2008 and 2009 of company was a bit smaller. So the acquisition of AGL Resources came in heads and so our cost complex is quite a bit larger than this. Our O&M -- total O&M is something in the $5-plus billion range, maybe addressable a little bit smaller than that. But I think it gives us plenty of room to be responsible around this range. Paul Fremont : Great. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael. How are you? Michael Lapides : I am well Tom, how are you? Glad to hear everybody in the Southern Company family is doing as well as possible. Thank you for taking the question. I actually want to ask you about the jurisdiction that people don't ask you about, that may be one of the best ones people don't think about enough. Can you talk about Alabama? And can you talk about both where things stand with the approval of both the gas plants and the solar both the PPAs and ownership that you all filed at the PSC? And also, I thought there was a -- a rate docket there this year as well or undergoing in the winter and into the spring. Can you just give us an update on that? And then finally, how different is Alabama demand trends relative to ordinal ones? Tom Fanning : Yes. I would say, in general, you're in a giant process that's on track in Georgia for all that stuff -- I'm sorry, in Alabama. Yes, I think everything is going as we thought it would there. Drew Evans : Yes. Your question about customer mix, just like in the entirety of our jurisdictions, it tends to move toward more industrial as you move west generally. Tom Fanning : That's true. But what's interesting in Mississippi? 25% of Mississippi sales are wholesale. And those wholesale sales are largely residential. So you give it a bit of a different mix in Mississippi, but it's small, but Drew is exactly right. Alabama and Georgia are pretty similar. Michael Lapides : Okay. And can you remind us in Alabama, what the rate request was? And also what the time line to get approval for the gas plant, both acquisition and development? Tom Fanning : I think we were looking towards June, summer -- early summer for that process to occur. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you. Drew Evans : And I think the only other piece of news there, it's not Alabama PSC news, but the FERC did approve the gas plant acquisition that we projected early summer. So we got that out of the way. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated. Tom Fanning : Thank you my friend. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hey, Julien. How are you doing? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, how are you guys. Thanks you very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the O&M front. So you guys have -- revenue, right? I wanted to be very clear about this. When you think about the cost savings effort just to quantify a little bit more, basically, you're saying that you can offset anything in that range or how do you think about the sort of the magnitude of cost savings that you're contemplating today? You're doing -- you're looking at this as 250 to 400, is that's the equivalent O&M amount that you're looking at in your planning here? Drew Evans : Yes. No, I think the simple way to think about it is that we're going to put plans in place or work through plans that could help us in either under this range. What we actually have to execute against is going to be determined by how quickly the economies respond in our service territories. Tom Fanning : And the other thing I would just say, I mean, that's a range that's here, again, I hate to say with all this uncertainty, it's kind of who knows. But I think earlier, maybe a month ago, I was saying $250 million to $350 million, we track down $50 million, just out of conservatism and a more prolonged kind of effect. Drew Evans : I don't want to give you the impression, Julien, that this is limitless pool. There are certainly limitations and we're just going to have to see how the demand responsive also over time. Tom Fanning : But there, again, too, that would reflect even at highest ends, we're still within the range. Drew Evans : Yes. And probably most folks don't know. The easiest way to turn this into earnings per share that we generally are about $10 million per penny and so you can divide this by 10 and get some sense of the range of impact in total on a gross revenue basis and that adjusted. That's for pre-tax. Tom Fanning : You need to tax effect that. He was -- Drew just gave you an after-tax net income effect. So this is pre-tax. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, understood. All right. Let me come back to the --. When you guys talk about the sawtooth 20% reduction here in workforce, how are you thinking about making that up on the project? And you also talked about delaying the Unit 4 in this year. Are you thinking that you're going to be ramp back up labour later in the schedule here at this point? Or how do you make up for that 20% workforce reduction cumulatively? Tom Fanning : Yes. Thanks, Julien. There's a good draw with my finger here in the air. But if we were doing a one-on-one, I draw my little piece of paper, my hand written things, I'm so payment for there. Just imagine this, if I had a curve that showed 9,000 people on site, as we wind down Unit 3 construction heading into hot functional tests, the wind down of people on-site for Unit 3 occurs. So the curve actually goes down. What we're doing is and what we've said about kind of hot functional tests being kind of now August, September. All we did was push it out a little. Imagine you pushed your hand down on the peak of 9,000 and it pushes out a little bit to the right. So all we've done is tried to maintain that level. I don\u2019t think you're going to see another big peak here. We were already at the peak. And I think now that peak starts to wind down. That's why we feel comfortable with the movement from 9,000 to 7,000 on-site, drawing some off of 4, which pushes 4 back to its original schedule and still maintaining our ability to hit the aggressive site plan for Unit 3. All we did was shift the curve a little bit, and we funded that curve with Unit 4. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. And quick follow-up here, and I'll round it out here. Under what scenarios would you consider stopping construction around COVID? So it sounds like you guys have a lot of mitigating factors already implemented, a lot of compartmentalization of labour already going on in terms of mitigating factors. But how do you think about what that scenario might look like? And when you might trigger that, just to address the range of scenarios here? Tom Fanning : Yes. You know what, I suppose there is a hypothetical in there. Julien, I just don't think that's likely. I think America, let me just speak broadly, and I'll take it down to the site. America has to learn to live with the virus. Our experience so far, knock on wood, has been much less than what you've seen in the industry about half. And our experience on site, likewise, have been less severe, I think largely because of the smart actions, the people on the site have taken, for example, removing the at-risk personnel and paying them well before we saw the effects of the site -- on the site. People are now coming back to work. One other point is, it looks like the average over the past, I don't know, four weeks. If you do a four-week look at average, it looks as if we may be past the peak on the site. Now, that will only be borne out in the next few weeks to come. But if you do a seven-day rolling average, it looks as if incidence levels are decreasing. So look, there's a hypothetical in there. I really think it's a practical manner. The job at hand is, continue the good work we're doing on site, make that an attractive place for people to work, which I think we're doing. And I think the labour unions at all are calling us out for that kind of unprecedented response and keep going. I just don't think -- I don't see it right now, but we'll see. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right. Yes. You can tell me its happening. Excellent. Well, thank you for the time. All the best. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Julien. Appreciate it, bud. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hello, Andrew. Thanks for joining us. Andrew Weisel : Hey, everyone. In the interest of time, I'll really stick to one question here on Page 11. I'm a little surprised. Maybe I missed this, I apologize if I did, but you're forecasting a bigger decline for commercial volumes in industrial. Most other utilities you're talking about it the other way. And I know you mentioned your mix is roughly a-third, a-third, a-third. So can you explain why you're expecting a deeper hit to commercial than industrial? Tom Fanning : Yes. Look, I -- and the good news there is, if that's what your big hit is, I think your ability to come back is much better. It will come back quicker. Your ability to shut down a plant and then get it back is harder than restarting a restaurant. In fact, I was on CNBC this morning, and I know right after me was the CEO of IMAX. He says, our ability to turn theatres back on, is almost instantaneous. So, look, that is an assessment of our key accounts, and our marketing teams across the system. That's just what we see. Our industrial make up, the kind of folks that we see, really have been having a great quarter. And in fact, if you look at the month-by-month sales at industrial, gosh, our momentum statistics, I'm fond of mentioning, we're showing really quite positive momentum through February. And it's just with COVID, what we saw were some companies taking outages. They said, 'Well, if we're going to want a socially distance, why don't we go ahead and take an outage and do some maintenance, sending a lot of people home.' We actually think industrial will recover faster, more resilient. The other thing that we have in the Southeast here is industrial dependent upon natural gas as a feedstock, particularly in the chemicals area. I think that's our number one industrial customer. And with natural gas being where it is, those guys are producing product at really attractive levels. We saw this again in 2008 and 2009. And essentially, I would say, Alabama has been particularly proactive in putting in place rate plans that preserve industrial load, where across the United States, they didn't have those things and industrials tended to shut down plants in other parts of the United States and move their productive capacity to the Southeast. For all those reasons, that's why we think industrial is more resilient than commercial. Good news is commercial is going to recover pretty quickly, in my opinion. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed. Paul Patterson : Thanks, Tom, happy to hear you. How you doing? It sounds you guys are doing well. Tom Fanning : Yes. We are hanging in there. Paul Patterson : So, I wanted to touch base with you on was served just basically your economic forecast, I guess. It sounds like you guys are quite optimistic that once this, the sort of stay at home and the social distancing stuff is resolved, people coming back and it will be business as usual. Is that the case? Are you guys basically thinking that -- I'm just wondering what is your economic forecast given your growth rate? And are you still sort of expecting 1% sales growth after this year? Tom Fanning : The 400 million estimate assumes that there's more of a through the year impact. Yes. I don't know that, we want to portray too much optimism. We Certainly, U-shape, it feels better where we're sitting today than maybe on the downward slope of it a couple of weeks ago. But our projection for a 5% reduction in total retail sales is quite exaggerated relative to what we've seen in history. And so this will not be without economic pain for sure. We do think that our economies generally in the Southeast benefit from the fact that we've got good in migration. And it's a good place to do business and so long-term, we -- relative to others, we think that we've got pretty decent economic climate. The amount of time it takes to get back to normalcy though is inestimable. Yes. There are lots of degrees of freedom in all this. It's just our most reasonable guess at this point. And I know, and my heart goes out to most of you guys on the phone and lives in the New York area. I'm from New Jersey, we all have relatives and people have been impacted by this. And so, we're very mindful of the grave circumstance. That's not the case down here; at least we haven't seen it. It's much less severe in the southeast than what you're experiencing up there. Paul Patterson : Okay. But just to sort of make sure I understand this, did you guys see a hit this year, but then it sounds like beginning of next year or pretty soon thereafter, you expect in terms of your earnings guidance and everything, your long-term growth rate that essentially that the economy will -- the global pandemic will not have that meaningful impact on economic activity in your region? Tom Fanning : So, yes. Okay. So now that's a -- I'm sorry, that's like a different question and it's interesting. Will there be destruction in the economy as a result of the COVID deal? That may be. My sense is the United States is in a pretty good position relative to global economies with respect to this issue we will see. In other words, is there going to be less demand from Europe for American products? What about China? One of the other impacts that we've been talking about at a federal level on this return to work is kind of revitalizing the supply chain to the United States, making us a little less dependent, particularly in critical infrastructure for reliance on foreign economies. Still sitting there in Congress is an infrastructure bill. My sense is, there's more energy used upon, behind future legislative initiatives, that could overcome some continuing sustaining impact of destruction in the economy. Some other things could emerge. My sense is right now, if I just sit here and think about 2021 and 2022, there may be some continuing impacts. But at this point, I don't think they're at all significant to the point where we would change our forward guidance on a 4% to 6% EPS growth rate. We the dominant issue for us is getting Vogtle Bill. Once we clear Unit 3 and Unit 4 to service, the rate of increase because of the earnings rates inside the construction period recover to a full return on capital. It's hard to beat that down. Paul Patterson : Okay. Just on Vogtle, just sort of quickly here. It looks like you guys are -- if I'm correct, when I've been estimating, it looks like for the people that you've been testing, and I think it's up into the 400 range now or something. It looks to me from the report something that it's remarkably pretty consistent at 28% to 30% or something. And I'm just wondering, is there any thought of maybe -- I mean, obviously, there are a lot more people than that working at the site. Is there any thought about doing antibody testing? Or are you guys thinking anything about heard immunity or anything like that? Or is it just basically sort of people who come in and say, hey, I don't feel well, give me a test kind of thing?' Tom Fanning : Look, we're -- we got early availability on the best test we can get the time, the antibody tests are really pretty interesting. In fact, we're talking about that at a national level. We have had Admiral Giroir from HHS. He's the Director of Health, and he kind of has the whole testing regime in place. That's something that's attractive, but it's just not available right now. We can test all over the place. And in fact, you can test everybody and they go home, and you'll have to retest them the next day and the next day and the next day. Testing is really valuable, and I don't underestimate it, but it doesn't solve the problem. Until we get a vaccine in place, we're going to be having to live with this environment in the nation. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just really quickly on the sales numbers. They include -- they're not adjusted out for leap year. Is that correct for the quarter? Tom Fanning : I think they are not adjusted. Paul Patterson : Okay. That's it for me. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Appreciate you join us. Drew Evans : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Drew Evans : Hi, Charles. Charles Fishman : Hey, thank you. Hi. Hey, just one question. You got a $40 billion five-year CapEx program. The bulk of it is not Vogtle. You've given us great detail on Vogtle. You had a statement, no expected supply chain problems, disruptions. What -- I get that, but what is causing you some concern within the supply chain? Is there something that's going to be more expensive in that CapEx? Is there something maybe you've pushed out a year or two that you'll still get done within the five-year plan? Any additional color on that, no expected supply chain disruption comment would be appreciated. Tom Fanning : Yes. So we're the size of the nation of Australia in round numbers. I get that statistic. We're a little bit smaller, but when you think about energy production, we're kind of in that league. We have long-standing relationships, and we are considered a high priority customer with a variety of resources. And when I say, we don't see any problems in the long run, that doesn't mean people aren't working really hard to make sure that they understand what the perturbations may be, and what they're going to do to resource them. We have been seeing some challenges, but we've always been able to overcome the challenges. And I want to say, Drew, we have about at least a six-month kind of forward window where we're absolutely confident of no problems. So that's kind of our safety margin, if you will. When you think about the nature of our CapEx budget, however, it is really tied up in making our system more resilient from a transmission and distribution standpoint. It is tied up in future generation, whether it is renewables or some of the new generation required in Alabama and Georgia. And then it is tied up in environmental matters, particularly for us, ash ponds, which I think is $10 billion over 10 years in round numbers. So it is stuff that I think we've got great visibility into the availability of the equipment required to support that program. It's not subject to, I guess, Drew uses the word smalls, we have a lot of visibility, and we're a big customer and people generally work very hard to meet our needs. And we have pushed on this a lot. We've got a great guy, Jeff Franklin that runs our supply chain for the system. We don't see a problem right now. Drew Evans : Yes. I'd say labour is a large component of our total CapEx plan. And as you said, environmental remediation at ash ponds isn't really reliant on technology in general. And we've got enough material for a pretty decent work front for a good period of time and expect in the long-term, some block chain is full replenish to meet whatever need we might have about. Tom Fanning : And let me throw one more factor out there. I'll throw another bouquet at somebody. The Director of CISA in Homeland Security is a guy named Chris Krebs; he's doing a terrific job within the confines of his responsibility in calling out. And my word, they put out an advisory bulletin of essential functions in America. And of course, Health and Human Services is right at top right now. But right behind that is the electricity function in America. That's also part of the recommendations by NIAC, National Infrastructure Advisory Council, and also the work product, of the Solarium Commission that I'm on. Look, people will put a high priority on making sure that our needs are met. One last point, we have a terrific relationship with our valued partners in the labour market. So the U.S. building trades have done a hell of a job, making sure that the people are there. And I think we work very hard to make sure that they are valued partners and treated as well as anybody treats them in the United States. They are strategic partners for decades, and we treat them like that. And I think the labour will be there when we need it. Charles Fishman : Okay. Tom, thank you for the extra long call on a extraordinary times. That was it. Tom Fanning : Yes. Thank you. No. We appreciate your attention. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Hello, Ashar. How are you? Always glad to have you with us. Ashar Khan : Great, Tom. Doing -- the progress is, I would say, exceptional and really very well you guys are doing. Can I just ask, I didn't want to ask the question, but I thought because of Reg I have seen -- because of disclosures and less contact. Usually, you have earned around $0.80 for the last four years in the second quarter except for one year 17, where we had like $0.05 or $0.06 of dilution, which hurt that quarter. And even then we earned 73. So can you just ascribe to me why the pattern of earnings is going to go from the average 80 to like 65 in the second quarter? What is it making it an abnormal second quarter versus the prior trajectory of how the earnings have come up? Tom Fanning : Yes, Ashar, let me actually -- I went deeper in preparing for this for the call. But like I said, I have in front of me the data last eight years, our low was $0.66, but we had three years in the 60, $0.66, $0.69, $0.68, $0.71, $0.73, $0.75. And only the last two years have been $0.80. All we're doing is taking a conservative shot at what the second quarter, COVID-19 thing is. It's always a fight. I always laugh. I used to be CFO, and I had always extract an estimate from the system CFOs. And well, the inside joke inside Southern is when the CFOs kind of report what they think, they always have a conservative bias. And the joke is that, the positive variances are always temporary and the permanent variances -- the negative variances are permanent. So we always have to fight through what the right answer is. I think Drew has done a great job. I can't say that 65% is light. I'll just say that, it's reasonable. There's a lot of degrees of freedom of conservatism around what's going to happen with COVID 19. We'll see, but that's the data. I got the data, right in front of me. Drew Evans : Ashar, it is fair to say that, this quarter will have most -- hopefully, the largest open hopefully the due to largest COVID-19 impact of any quarter that we'll experience. That's the hope and that's the expectation. If we're going to reduce our expense structure and as Tom said, that's generally through halting, adding additional headcount, which was part of our plan that is something that will reduce expenses over the course of the year and not be isolated to the second quarter. So we have to plan for light revenue in second and less expense mitigation that we think we can achieve over the balance of the year. Drew Evans : But we're still committed to our financial objectives for the year. I wouldn't get excited about the second quarter. We're still committed for the year. Ashar Khan : Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : And we had a good first quarter. I know you did. Excellent quarter. Yes. So good start. Operator, anything else? Operator : That will conclude today's question-and-answer session, sir. Are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Drew, you want to lead us off? Drew Evans : Again, I'd jus say, thank you to all the folks that are working hard on behalf of customers every day. I think we're living our core values. And I'm impressed that with 15,000 or 17,000 people working from home, we're getting the job done. So thank you very much to all the work teams that are working hard to have such a great outcome for us. Tom Fanning : And from my perspective, working at a national level, whether it's thinking about Homeland Security with Chris Krebs and his team, Department of Energy, Secretary Danbury all of his team is doing a terrific job. The industry is responding exceedingly well. And you should know that the industry in this case is a union of the investor-owned utilities and the cooperatives and the municipals. We are all working together to solve the problems as they arise. And in fact, the favourite Gretsky saying skate to where the puck will be. I think this industry is way beyond reacting to the present and really into thinking about the future. We're very mindful that hurricane season, storm season is ahead of us and being able to demonstrate as we have for decades, effective mutual response to the problem that will arise this year. I think the industry is doing a terrific job, so kudos to all of my brothers and sisters out there. And then finally, for Southern, what a great start to the year, that's given us some tailwind I think to address some of these things. There is a lot of uncertainty ahead. I'm very encouraged with the team at Vogtle. When you look at the data, I think they're managing these unexpected conditions in an exceedingly prudent manner. And the rest of the system is going great with their ability to respond to the storms and still serve customers well with this coronavirus protocol in place. I'm just very encouraged about our ability to deal with whatever comes our way for the rest of the year. That's why we remain committed. I want to thank you all. I know, especially those of you all in the Northeast, you know I'm from New Jersey; I got relatives up there. And I know you guys are dealing with some very tough times. And I know maybe your families or maybe friends of family are all being impacted. My thoughts and prayers go out to you all and I think working together, we're going to get through this thing. Thanks everybody for being with us today. I know it's an extra long call, but I hope we gave enough color around not only Southern situation, but the national situation to give everybody confidence in the next steps forward. Thanks, everybody. Talk to you soon. Operator, that's the conclusion of the call. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

Let me remind you, we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information, various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate we provided last quarter. While we remain within our expected annual range of COVID-related revenue impacts, the second quarter impacts were not as severe as we originally estimated. Employees throughout the Company have worked hard to maintain excellent levels of customer service and implemented thoughtful cost containment measures. Of course, our peak electric load occurs in the third quarter, and consistent with our long standing practice, we will wait to address our annual guidance in October. Before turning to the business update, I want to recognize that these are unusual times on multiple fronts. Our role in the communities we are privileged to serve has never been more important and apparent. Whether it\u2019s our response to the COVID pandemic or working within our communities from the racial justice, we continue to deliver results. I want to extend a huge thank you to our employees, customers, business partners and public officials. Southern Company and our operating companies remain committed to supporting our communities today and throughout what is expected to be a prolonged recovery period. Let\u2019s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. From a schedule perspective, we continue to remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates. We are maintaining an aggressive site work plan that targets a May 2021 in-service date for Unit 3, and seeks to provide margin through the regulatory approved in-service date. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power proportional share of the total project capital cost forecast increased in the second quarter by approximately $150 million to $8.5 billion largely reflecting estimated COVID-19 impacts and other costs and replenishment of contingency, based on our projections for the remainder of the project. As a result of these selected actions, Georgia Power recorded an after tax charge of approximately $110 million during the second quarter. Looking more closely at schedule, in the second quarter, we experienced significant impacts from COVID-19 among other factors. While the recent workforce reduction was effective in decreasing density at the site and increasing efficiency, we were unable to achieve the anticipated level of production. Recognizing these challenges, in June, we announced a re-sequencing of certain milestones. We shifted the expected start of cold hydro testing to the fall out of 2020 with the timing of the structural integrity test and integrated leak rate test to precede cold hydro. Both of these tests were successfully completed in mid July. In fact, the integrated leak rate test approached only 30% of the allowable margin and indication of the quality of the work being performed at the site. We accomplished several other interim milestones for Unit 3 during the second quarter, including the completion of closed vessel testing and the turbine assembly. The aggressive site work plan currently targets the September-October timeframe for the stars of cold hydro testing. We now expect Unit 3 hot functional testing to commence during the fourth quarter, and we continue to see a path to Unit 3 fuel load by year-end. However, recognizing that the aggressive site plan is now even more difficult to achieve than before the pandemic, it is important to remember that under the November benchmark fuel load is not required until mid-2021. And as a reference point, even if Unit 3 fuel load occurred in March, it would support an in-service date of next summer. We also reevaluated our estimates for costs and time to complete the final phases of construction, which resulted in hours being added to the direct construction projections for both units. Reflecting these additions, today, Unit 3 direct construction remains approximately 90% complete. We still expect construction completion of about 2% per month to be consistent with the aggressive site work plan and completion of approximately 1% per month to be consistent with the November benchmark schedule. Importantly, even amid the outbreak of the pandemic and our need to significantly modify work practices, our average monthly construction completion rate was approximately 1.5%. Over the last four weeks earned hours have surpassed our expectations relative to the November benchmark for each of the major work fronts, including electrical, mechanical and civil. As we move ahead, critical areas of focus remain electrical and subcontract performance. Now, turning to cost. We have always maintained that we expected to utilize our contingency accounts, but that was before the COVID pandemic occurred. As a result, we have increased Georgia Power\u2019s share of the total capital cost forecast by approximately $150 million to $8.5 billion. This represents an increase of a little less than 2%, certainly not all, but largely due to the COVID impact. The second biggest factor was a re-estimate of the amount of effort, and therefore hours required to complete the final phases of construction. Georgia Power allocated its remaining contingency and added new contingency of approximately $115 million, further reducing future cost risk through the completion of Unit 4. Embedded in the project\u2019s cost to complete are estimated COVID-19 related costs of between $70 million and $115 million for Georgia Power. Also recall, the estimated cost of the time between the aggressive site work plan target date and the regulatory approved November in-service date or a scheduled cost margin of approximately $250 million is also included in Georgia Power\u2019s base capital forecast. Together, the replenish costs contingency and the scheduled cost margin continue to represent approximately 20% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize the entirety of contingency funds as we progress towards completion of the project.  The team at Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to work incredibly hard and drive meaningful progress at the site, even while managing through the pandemic. As we neared the final phases of construction for Unit 3 and move closer to fuel load, I can assure you that the construction team, our management team and our partners are more focused than ever on bringing in the first unit of this historic project to completion next year. As we approach the final key milestones, we recognize that the aggressive site work plan is increasingly difficult, as most of our optionality relative to May 2021 in-service day has been utilized. But both, management at the site and workforce remain motivated to pursue the aggressive schedule to provide margin to the November regulatory in-service date. Drew, I\u2019ll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials and our outlook. Drew Evans : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope that you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, which is $0.02 lower than last year and $0.13 above our estimate for the quarter. The primary driver compared to last year was a decline in sales led by COVID-19-related demand reduction, largely offset by diligent cost control and constructive state regulatory actions completed in 2019 at our utilities. The estimated impact during the quarter from COVID-19 was negative $0.10, and the weather impact relative to normal was negative $0.03. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in today\u2019s releases and earnings package. Year-to-date through June, the dynamics were similar, though COVID-19 impacts were largely absent in the first quarter. For the first six months of the year, adjusted EPS was $1.56, which is $0.06 higher than last year. Year-to-date, COVID-19 impacts are estimated at negative $0.11 and weather impacts were negative $0.13 compared to normal. We continue to assess the financial impacts of COVID-19 on our business with the key focus areas being sales declines, customer arrears and bad debt expectations. In the second quarter, total kilowatt hour sales impacts from COVID-19 were in line with the expectations we provided last quarter. Weather-normalized retail sales were down approximately 8% with residential sales up 5%, commercial sales down 12%, and industrial sales down 14%. COVID-19-related sales impacts on our commercial classes were a bit better than we anticipated with industrial impacts a bit worse than expectation for the quarter. Factoring in all customer classes, our non-fuel revenue came in slightly above our forecast. Looking ahead, we continue to base our COVID-19 forecasts for 2020 on a U-shaped recession, with modest economic recovery across our service territories over the balance of the year. Our retail sales projection for the full year is unchanged with an expected overall decline in the range of 2% to 5% on a weather-normal basis. Let me also reiterate our expectation that retail sales in these ranges with lower total non-fuel electric revenues by approximately $250 million to $400 million on a consolidated basis. Based on what we have achieved through the second quarter, we also continue to believe that pandemic-related sales impacts in 2020 can be mitigated through interim cost containment measures. As we undertake cost containment initiatives, we\u2019re maintaining our focus on safety, customer service, reliability and affordability. With our solid results through the first half of the year, we\u2019re well-positioned as we head into peak electric load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2020 is $1.15 per share on adjusted basis. And consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter. In addition to sales, we\u2019ve also been monitoring customer arrears and the potential for an increase in bad debt expense. Customer arrears have trended better than anticipated across our operating companies, and our liquidity position remains robust. Constructive mechanisms have been put in place by the Commission in many of our states allowing us to address COVID related costs and bad debt expense in future regulatory proceedings. Additionally, to the first half of 2020, we are on target to meet our annual capital plan. At this point, we do not anticipate the future impacts of COVID-19 or the Vogtle impact Tom discussed, will materially impact credit metrics across the Company. And as we said last quarter, we do expect these factors -- we do not expect these factors to affect our long-term outlook. Before I turn it over back to Tom, I\u2019d like to highlight some statistics in our energy mix trends so far this year. Through June, generation from coal represents just 13% of our energy mix, and over one-third of our generation mix was from zero carbon resources. For the full year, our projections indicate that generation from coal could be below 20% for the first time in modern history. We acknowledge that this near-term outcome is partially driven by extremely low natural gas prices and electricity demand reductions from both the pandemic as well as mild weather. But the long term trend is also driven by less temporal factors, including a combination of coal plant retirements and a concerted effort to increase our renewables portfolio. In the coming weeks, we expect to publish a supplement to our 2018 carbon report. The supplemental report provides additional detail on potential pathways to achieve Southern Company\u2019s goal of net zero emissions by 2050. This is an important transition for our Company and we look forward to discussing this report with you in the months ahead. With that, Tom, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Drew. Before we take your questions, let me acknowledge Congressman, John Lewis. His funeral is being held in Atlanta today. He was a wonderful man. We are thankful for his service and his work combating racial injustice, and his commitment to non-violence. I also want to address the topic of racial injustice. Recent events have resulted in demonstrations around the world that are leading to necessary and important discussions about racial injustice in our society. One way to think about racial injustice issue is to imagine a series of sine waves over time. Every so often, the peak of the sine wave rises to the point that this issue impacts our national consciousness, and frankly, we all see it. But, with the passage of time, these events fade from the headlines of our nation. However, we all know the underlying systemic problems still exist. One of our objectives at Southern is to keep these important issues at the forefront by focusing on sustained improvement. In my opinion, that\u2019s where we should place our efforts today, if we want to make lasting improvements to racial justice in America. We are having meaningful discussions in our Company and are committed to long-term actions. In closing, these are unusual times for our world and nation as we contend with the COVID pandemic, economic uncertainty, and racial injustice. While it is not unusual, it is the way our Company is responding. We\u2019re delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. We are consistently working to understand and meet the needs of our employees, customers and communities, and we remain focused on our key business objectives, including operating our utilities at best-in-class levels, demonstrating cost discipline, and working diligently to bring Vogtle Units 3 and 4 on line by the November regulatory approved in-service dates. We believe Southern Company is well positioned to successfully execute on these fronts and uphold our goal of achieving an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. We so appreciate you joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Turning to Vogtle, just if I can ask, COVID is making something of a wave -- a second wave here, how do you think about factoring that into your contingencies? And then, separately, I want to come back to the comments you made, because it sounds like worker productivity and absenteeism is not being impacted at least by the second wave? Tom Fanning : It certainly is less than the first time. Look, if you remember when the United States went through this first wave, there was even a lot of conversation about stopping mega projects. We had lots of Southern Company Board meetings, management time, site time, really thinking through what is the best course of action to play here. And as you remember, and I think we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, we took extraordinary measures to make sure that the workforce at Vogel Units 3 and 4 were better protected at the site than they would be kind of in the surrounding area or when they return home. We did things like we created a medical village at the site that provided testing and PPE and all sorts of things. And we received national acclaim for those steps by folks like the United States Building Trades. So, we did our whole lot. Even so, as we thought about what do we do about the workforce there, we saw a great deal of absenteeism. And so, one of the byproducts of the workforce reduction that we did at the site, roughly 2,000 people, we basically gave people the option to leave. And those people that were most concerned about working in a COVID environment, left. The people that have agreed to say, get the idea that we\u2019ve got to continue work, that the COVID protocols we put in place make sense, and that their health is being looked after in an excellent way. And the data would show that. And in fact, we finished the first wave with -- we measure the cases of COVID positive tests, we had several periods of time where we went to zero. And so, everything we were doing was working. And, certainly, the productivity started doing pretty well. We are we think now in a second period of COVID wave. And we have -- and I would probably measure this thing probably from Memorial Day is where it kind of started, a lot of people left, coming back to the site, and they\u2019ve gotten exposed to potentially other sources of impact from the COVID virus. And so, we\u2019re seeing that now. So, the question we have to ourselves is, are we reaching a plateau? Are we starting to recover from this thing? We have our own medical staff that we hired to oversee. There are some beliefs that this thing will have a shape similar to the first wave and then it will start to erode, but time will tell. Okay? I mean, the other thing we don\u2019t know Julien is whether there will be a third wave and a fourth wave, we just don\u2019t know. But, certainly, the folks that are working right now get the idea of working in a COVID environment. And I don\u2019t know whether you guys saw my time on Squawk Box this morning. We have a chart in your package, I forget what page it is, that also suggests -- I guess, it\u2019s on page 12, that also suggests that America may be adapting to this new reality. And we\u2019re seeing it in our numbers. We absolutely don\u2019t know whether that will sustain. But, it\u2019s a very interesting chart. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Well, I hope you\u2019re doing well. Separately, if I can, on the contingencies just to wrap this up, what contingencies remain? How do you frame that? You made a lot of comments at the outset on contingency. I just want to try to summarize that a little bit more precisely and talk about what latitude remains here? Tom Fanning : Yes. So, think about it in two pieces, right? So, one piece is just a straight cost estimate. And so, we\u2019ve done things like added in additional hours, this effort we talked about. And this rally, we made an estimate on the completion of the construction activities about two years ago. And so, we made estimates on the final civil work, hanging concrete panels, what it would take to do the roof shield building. These are not increases in scope. Rather, they are really estimates of what we believe, how much effort, how much hours will be required in order to accomplish that scope. Another thing that we talk about is I&C, and this is how difficult it is, how much effort is required to run cable from say the sources of electricity to the cabinet, to the terminal point in the plant. Mechanical, how much piping, how much effort will be to finish the pipe work, electrical, cable tray installation, cable poles, we\u2019ve talked about the size of the cables, and the amount of effort to terminate those cables. I could go on. But, that is where we have kind of taken into account other costs that ultimately go into an increase in the contingency account. It also -- we\u2019ve added in an allowance for incurring per DM costs through 2021, really the finish of the construction of Unit 4, that wasn\u2019t in there before. So we\u2019ve added a lot in here. And let\u2019s think about it in two pieces, one is cost, one is scheduled contingency. Let\u2019s make sure we all understand that. 100% dollar is $540 million, Georgia Power share $250 million. You could make your own judgment about when we\u2019re going to finish the project. But, that amount of money is derived from the cost of completing in May to November. So, just to pick -- just to give you a point of reference, everything else being equal, if you finished in August, you would have roughly half of that scheduled contingency available. So, that\u2019s another way to think about scheduled contingency. Certainly, there could be other costs that can emerge over time. I\u2019ll tell you one other thing, Julien. There was a great bit of debate about this whole issue. We really wrestled with this thing. When you think about it and we tried to have these concepts in the script, as we have allocated the remaining contingency and then added back to this 20% number, it is pretty clear to us that we have reduced risk. Because we\u2019ve identified risk items, we\u2019ve allocated current contingency and added new. So, there was some argument that said we don\u2019t need 20% right now, maybe we should go with a lower number. At the end of the day, we think we took prudent action by this. Let\u2019s keep contingency at 20%. Let\u2019s not hit any of the contingency available and schedule. And let\u2019s move forward on that basis. We think this is a disciplined approach. We think it is conservative. And I think, we\u2019re in a good spot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : So, look, I think since your last in between we got the staff [ph] report on Volvo and the staff did seem to disagree on some things and I think they say that the November date is highly unlikely. Tom Fanning : Yes. Steve Fleishman : And also kind of talk to $1 billion potential cost increase and other kind of factors that they mentioned. Could you just address in your, I guess, view there, like where are the differences in view here? Tom Fanning : You bet. And I think it\u2019s going to be pretty clear stuff. And I think we\u2019re going to give testimony here pretty soon about how we see it versus what they see. And certainly, there\u2019s no new data that they\u2019re working on. We used the same data. It\u2019s really how you view the data is what gives rise to a difference. Like for example, we really start with data that was established some two years ago, and the staff doesn\u2019t give us credit for the work done over the past year, in which we have earned a CPI multiple of 1.3. In order to derive their numbers, they use somewhere between 1.4 and 1.45. Well, in fact, they are ignoring our performance over the last two years. And we would argue that -- and we\u2019ve talked about this on prior calls that all of this electrical work particularly has been especially difficult to do. We call that scheduled versus unscheduled electrical. And as we move into the scheduled electrical work has been really hard and it has given us high CPI numbers. But as we get to the unscheduled CPI numbers, we\u2019re getting numbers less than 1. So, as we move forward and get the hard work behind us, there is some, at least reasonable expectation, we will be able to at least maintain the 1.3 CPI. So, we don\u2019t believe in their 1.4, 1.45 assumption. The other thing they would say is that they go back to our assumptions, if you recall, on the schedule that was put in place two years ago, in which we had lots -- not a lot, that\u2019s a qualitative term, but a good bit of a schedule float time, okay? And in fact, we\u2019ve consumed a lot of that here recently with the re-estimate and re-sequencing and all that. And that\u2019s where we said, we\u2019ve taken a lot of that margin out. But, the schedule they would use would say things like this that, hot functional tests of fuel load is 5 to 6 months long. Well, we really think it\u2019s more like three months. They would say fuel load in service is six months long. Well, we really think it\u2019s four months. What they\u2019re doing is counting all that management margin time that we now account for. So, look, we have a plan margin. We think that all adds up to that four to five months difference from their own estimate. And I want to say -- I hope somebody will correct me here that their own estimate said something like February of 23 for Unit 4. If you take four to five months away from that that puts us in the summer well in advance of November, at a lower cost. Those would be the big items. Steve Fleishman : Great. The other thing that was mentioned, which I think you\u2019ve addressed before, and just even today, was just on the testing, and they highlighted, like 80% of tests failed initially. But, then I think you guys said a lot of them then test soon after, and then you just test these other key tests that you mentioned. Could you just give more color on that issue and just clarify why that wasn\u2019t an important data point, I guess? Tom Fanning : Yes. Well, it\u2019s almost like you extrapolate from the worst data point and you projected results. Our actual results have been better than that. Yes. Look, I mean, the data is the same. We did have some failure rates on our early testing. We maintain that early testing. It\u2019s so illuminating to the future challenges of the project and we have said forever, if you think about values, assumption of risk and return. Yeah, we spend a little more money to do early testing, but we think it is well worth it in risk reduction, in thinking about problems that may lay ahead. If we learn quickly, fail quickly, and then correct in the future, I think that really helps reduce risk in the project. And I think, we\u2019ve done a great job there. From that 80% number, we have put Tiger teams in place. We have seen improvements. And if you look at these two major tests that were just done, they were put ahead of the cold hydro testing, the structural integrity test, integrated leak rate test. With the allowable margin on the ILRT, we were only at 30% of the allowable margin. I think, even oversight people were surprised that how well that went. I think that really speaks to the future quality of work. There will always be problems. And that\u2019s part of what testing is all about, you find the problems and you fix them. So, I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be problems. But, I think, the rate that they use to extrapolate into the future is way too high. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying those things. I appreciate it. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael, how are you? Michael Weinstein : All right, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m glad to hear that you sound like you\u2019re doing well. I saw some headlines that you had tested positive at one point. Tom Fanning : Yes. But, I was completely asymptomatic. My wife Sarah actually was the one that started feeling ill and when she did, she tested positive and then I went in and tested and I was positive. But, I think no germ will have me. I never had a bad -- and now, I\u2019m negative. Michael Weinstein : Well, I\u2019m glad to hear that. I just wanted to give my well wishes on your health. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Michael Weinstein : Hey, do you have any -- can you tell us anything you know about what\u2019s going on with the Chinese plants, the sentiment? Is there, any -- are other lessons that you\u2019re already starting to apply now, as you enter the testing phase and sort of entering the final stages of construction? Have there been any lessons learned from China that you\u2019re beginning to apply to lower risk? Tom Fanning : Sure. I think, the good news is, is that they are all running well, and that any lesson we\u2019ve had we\u2019ve taken into account, and we\u2019ve actually gone back and improved some processes that even are newer since. You remember, everybody was kind of freaked out and probably rightfully so on reactor coolant pumps, but we\u2019ve gotten through that and no issues that we\u2019ve seen on our site, didn\u2019t expect any. The only other thing I would say, especially as we\u2019re approaching kind of completion of our unit is that we have much more automation in terms of finishing construction, in terms of testing and variety of other things. The Chinese plant tended to throw personnel at any issue. So, I think we\u2019re going to be a little bit different and there won\u2019t be as many lessons learned just from the work process, so anyway. Michael Weinstein : Got you. And maybe we could just get kind of a regulatory update. I know there\u2019s not much to update on this area, but I think there were some filings that you\u2019re planning on making this fall on the gas utility side. And now maybe you can update on where you think the IRP process is going and future opportunities for construction of plants. And on the same token, what are your plans going forward for Southern Power? Tom Fanning : Drew, why don\u2019t you take the regulatory stuff? I\u2019ll do Southern. Drew Evans : I\u2019ll take a crack on regulatory. We\u2019ve largely resolved the resource planning that was done in Alabama. And I think that you can take a look at what we filed in the Q, but specifically we will construct a gas facility. We will purchase the gas facility, and we will enter into some contracts for additional capacity. We have two other jurisdictions that are involved in rate making. D&G filed with the expectation that rates will be in effect subject to refund at the beginning of next year and will be resolved sometime in the first or second quarter of next. And then, AGL Resources -- I\u2019m sorry. Atlanta Gas Light, filed its annual GRAM filing with the expectation that will be finalized by year end. So those are sort of the two outstanding, but three major rate filings for the year. Tom Fanning : And remember, Georgia has kind of just completed its triennial deal and not much there. We do have a BCM filing in February, then it will be important. Otherwise, we\u2019re carrying out the IRP. We\u2019ve not received the final order in Alabama. Southern power, we are where we were. We\u2019re out in those markets, particularly wind and solar, some storage, and we just find those -- that market be extraordinarily challenging. And we were big into it for a while, but that\u2019s an end market was hot. The contract periods are shorter -- I mean the contract terms are tougher. We found that to be a tougher place to allocate capital. And so, what you see is, more than 90% of our net income is coming from these wonderful franchise businesses that are the electrics and the gas. We\u2019ve allocated one time -- I forget how much it was, it was like 6 billion one year. But now, our allocation of capital to Southern Power, PowerSecure is now about 500 million a year. And I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ll spend that or not. We\u2019ll just see. But, it doesn\u2019t have much of a near term impact. We had closed a couple of wind deals, both -- they were called Redding and Beech Ridge. But again, it\u2019s not that big a deal. In terms of their operating performance they\u2019re doing great. They\u2019re producing what we thought they would. We\u2019re just not allocating a lot of future capital that way. Drew Evans : Completed construction at Redding, in the process of construction at [indiscernible] I\u2019d say our opportunities are largely wind related. Although there are two projects that we\u2019re working on within the California jurisdiction for battery, which I think is an interesting place for us to explore and understand these battery additions to existing solar facilities and I think give us good intelligence on how to produce the asset, what the economics of the asset are and what the operational characteristics are. So, I\u2019m pretty excited about that. Tom Fanning : It was fascinating about kind of where we cast our die at this point. It\u2019s with the franchise businesses. We used to talk a whole lot about Southern Power and what the markets were. Right now, we think regular, predictable, sustainable earnings on a good risk adjusted basis are coming out of our franchises. That\u2019s how we\u2019re making our money going forward. Drew Evans : The vast majority of our total capital plan over the next five years. Tom Fanning : Yes. Michael Weinstein : Hey, one last question along these lines. The big nuclear plant about to come on line, are you guys thinking about maybe some experiments in terms of the hydrogen economy, producing hydrogen off a nuclear plant and green gas, just a thought I had? Tom Fanning : As a matter of fact, we are. Now at the risk of telling long story, I\u2019ll tell a short story. [Technical Difficulty] my kind of term here, we did something called a SO Prize kind of built along the XPRIZE concept. One of the six winners was hydrogen. So, we\u2019ve been working on hydrogen now for seven years roughly. Very fascinating kind of idea about hydrogen is that it\u2019s a great storage medium. And you can pair hydrogen or hydrogen technology with kind of electrolysis and solar and a variety of other things. The other thing we\u2019re looking at is future gas generation that may be able to use hydrogen as a mix with natural gas, or even at the extreme, exclusively in place of natural gas. Remember, we toyed around a little bit of this with Plant Ratcliffe. We think there are applications going forward. And we are hard at work with that. It\u2019s one of these things that\u2019s R&D for sure. I think right now it\u2019s kind of out of the money. But remember, the job of R&D is to say things that are out of the money and make them in the money. That does occupy a certain segment of our R&D budget right now. Funny, you should ask that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski : So, I have a question about the contingency. So, I think, we all expected that you guys are going to tap into this contingency at some point. We\u2019re hopefully getting close to the end of construction cycle for Unit 3. I think, what is somewhat surprising is one that you have rescaled with the contingency and that by writing down this additional process, and I assume that you will not be seeking recovery of the additional funding, even though it seems like it\u2019s driven by COVID, which is not something that you could have control. And then, secondly, so, we\u2019re getting seemingly very close, as I said, to the end of construction, at least for Unit 3. And so, some of those assertions that you\u2019ve been making about the project progressing faster than what the staff [ph] believes, about to be in essence validated. So, how can you make us more comfortable that one, there\u2019s no additional, basically realignment of the construction plan for Unit 3 coming within the next three months. And then well, that is probably the main issue is one, why did you increase the contingency and wrote it down and two, how comfortable should we feel about this new schedule, given that we have still little time left until the end of the year? Tom Fanning : That is right. And thank you for all the questions. You are at the heart. I think I mentioned before that we really had enormous debates internally about all this. But, let's just kind of put it this way. In the script, I refer to the fact that when we established the original contingency it was before we had COVID. And COVID was arguably the biggest factor in thinking about, reestablishing a higher contingency level. Of course there were other factors. But that was one of them. And, with respect to recovery, I think that is an issue for the future. We are not saying no and never. And I know there have been some writings in the analyst community about likelihood there. But I don't think it is appropriate for us to go through those issues right now. And therefore, we would not seek to offset and accounting charge with a belief of probable outcome in that regard. The other one that came into that argument was schedule. I will let you all make your own belief about what schedule is. We think May this is consistent with every time we have ever said this. The May aggressive schedule is aggressive, less than 50%, et cetera. And recently, we said it has even gotten tougher, because we have removed margin. At the same time, we say that we expect to achieve November. So we tried to suggest that there range between May and November. And all other things being equal, forget other new challenges we may face. Some event scheduled contingency may be available, but we weren't willing and I should say that scheduled contingency is also referred to in the text here as owners contingency, which requires all of our co-owners, [Indiscernible] me and Dalton Sue agreed to. So we have left it in place. I think the approach we have taken Angie with respect to the accounting charge associated with the increase in costs and part of increasing costs was a replenishment less contingency is just conservative and prudent. And we think it is the right thing to do. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And the second part which is if you will be able to look to by the end of this year, or even early next year? I mean, how soon in the sense will you know if that is achievable come the EI where we know? Tom Fanning : Yes, good question. So if I got you to page seven or the chart seven, whatever it is, Vogtle unit three direct, construction and major milestones, we suggested that we could start cold hydro, kind of in the September, October time frame. And that it would take - I don't know, 10-days. And then shortly thereafter, we will start our functional testing. It is so interesting listening to the investors and thank you for hanging with us through all this. A lot of the bet, if you will, on Southern are taken by the accomplishment of these milestones. We have suggested in the past, if you get to fuel load, that certainly is a whole lot of information. I mean, you passed hot functional test, data to have an operating plan. And it just doesn't operate off nuclear fuel yet. And we passed the ITACs and now we load nuclear fuel and we go on from there. Other people have suggested the next big lever is the hot functional testing. In other words, with a third-party if you will heat source, not nuclear fuel, does the plant work. Every milestone that we have been passing so far, has given us comfort that we have a quality plan and then we will be able to hit our schedule expectations. This chart, I think, lays out our best guess as to what those things may be. And the other thing we added to the script this time was just to give you some comfort on variants Angie and it really goes to the idea. We have said that fuel by the end of the year is our objective and the site is working like dogs to get there. But even if we were three months late, then that suggests perhaps summer in service say. I think all this is meant to give you some sensitivity and an indication of our ability to hit November. I hope that is helpful. Angie Storozynski : Yes. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Sophie Karp : So I'm looking at Slide 10 on your deck, right? And it seems like what you have here is $0.05, tailwind from O&M, right? Is that net of $0.10 negative with COVID impacts? Is it like the right way of creating that? Tom Fanning : So Sophie COVID impacts are in rates, pricing usage and other. And so that would be the impact of COVID, which we have denominated for you for each of the two periods. And then you would add back to it any changes in rates or usage of utilities related to the rate activity from last year. And so these really represent O&M relative to last year's performance. Sophie Karp : So basically the O&M is the clean $0.5 O&M number and should we expect a similar kind of run rate for the second half? Tom Fanning : It is a good question. We are spending an awful lot of time thinking about costs in general, Southern has always been very strong, had a strong ability to compensate for changes in weather demand, in particular. This year, we have been faced with weather demand and with impacts related to the Corona Virus. And we have been very pleased with the discipline that each of our employees has exhibited. We are looking at the components of those costs. And in general, you could imagine with the cessation of hiring will have a reduction in headcount relative to our expectation, no reduction in our actual workforce, which leads to reduction of benefits and incentives and travel and entertainment and a number of cascading factors. We have also had a series of expenses related to operations of facilities, which are not safety related, but because generation has been lighter due to COVID and whether, we actually had been able to through normal cycles deferred. This is not a deferral of maintenance, maintenance that will pass until the unit has operated for certain number of hours is maybe the right way to think about it. We also have other factors like vegetation management that works, I guess the seven year cycle. But suffice it to say there were a number of items that are one in period. And two that might create a headwind for future. And we are just monitoring those buckets and we want to make sure we are responsive to current period, but also future period. And so, I wouldn't say that these would necessarily hold in that will examine what our needs are after we get through the next three months, which is the lion share of the summer cooling season. Drew Evans : Yes. I think you said exceedingly well. And we have talked about this in years past, where we have some optionality in terms of spending, right? Some stuff we have to do and we do it, some stuff we have the ability to do it today, tomorrow, the next month and the next month or after next year. And if we have the ability through better-than-expected weather, et cetera, we will do here. So, we can move with loads, and that what is kind of interesting about what Drew said earlier about kind of where we are in our revenue expectation for this COVID, where we set it up this year. I mean, I'm just going to guess right now we are mid-point or below, certainly not trending adversely. And if you look at that July thing, I don't know whether that is going to sustain or not. But our revenue picture is coming in a little better than what we thought. Therefore, there may open up some opportunities some more. We will see. Sophie Karp : Terrific. Thank you for this color. And then, I was just wondering on the COVID impact as it relates to Vogtle, right. So clearly that is causing some of the impact here. And that is not something that was contemplated or you are obviously foreseeing at the time of 2017 settlements. Is there a point where it is merit for you to visit that settlement or is it just too insignificant in the grand scheme of things right now to be thinking about them? Tom Fanning : Well no, I think it is a fair question. But I think it is a question for kind of, right now, everything you are dealing is an estimate. It really isn't a cash impact right now, not a material one. This is really what we are estimating going forward. Let some time pass and let's see what we are doing, and we certainly have the history of ongoing constructive conversations with regulators about unforeseen circumstances, and that is probably not going to happen this year. Let's see in the future. Sophie Karp : Got it. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate you taking my questions. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Always glad to have you with us. Operator : Thank you. our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Durgesh Chopra : Hey. Thanks Tom and glad to see you are doing well. Thank you for taking my question. So, maybe Drew first to you, just, you showed this very good slide on slide 11 that is, which shows sort of the projection and the actual results. What is embedded into the Q3 $1.15 EPS guidance on that front? What kind of retail production are you embedding specifically in that Q3 number? Can you share that with us? Drew Evans : I can tell you is that, we think that Q3 might have a impact that is very similar in aggregate to Q2. And so, which would make it a smaller percentage of the total, maybe $0.10 or $0.11 cents in aggregate and that is simply because the summer period is much higher sustained output of kilowatt hour sales given the cooling load. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thank you for that. And just one quick one. You didn't put out any materials reaffirming your long-term guidance in [indiscernible] plant. And I think that is consistent with how you have done it previously. For the Q1 print actually had you reforming the long-term growth guidance, I guess, but no change to your - I think you said this in your commentary, but I wanted to clarify, no change your long term capital plan as well as your long term EPS growth rate is it correct? Drew Evans : And capital requirements, all three of those factors are true, in fact. Tom Fanning : And once again, historically, we deal with that in our first quarter or no, our year-end call, which would be early February. We will update all that, but yeah, there is - and if there was something material we would say so. But you should just travel with what you have. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thank you guys be safe and healthy. Thanks. Tom Fanning : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Paul Fremont : I guess my first question is, how many remaining ITACs are there on unit three? Tom Fanning : 261. Those are those are open that is out of 399. So, we have completed 138, just to save you from the math. Paul, one another thing on the 261, a lot of those are what we call UIN. That means we have essentially had these ITACs approved Ethics Commission except for the results of the test. Paul Fremont : So I mean, I think if I recalled on the first quarter call, it looks like you have reduced that number by roughly 10. From the first from the first quarter call? Tom Fanning : Yes. Paul Fremont : Okay. And then do you have construction work hours scheduled after the revised sort of hot functional testing? I think one of the things that staff mentioned in their report was it was unusual. Normally, that construction is complete when you start hot functional testing. Tom Fanning : Yes, but I wouldn't get excited about that. We made that change in February. And so if you have construction work hours after hot functional test, it would be things that aren't critical to the operation of the plant, in other words, not critical to the nuclear operation. So it may be civil were. Drew Evans : In the coding phase. Tom Fanning : Yes. Paul Fremont : Okay. And then I guess this cold hydro testing needs to be completed before hot heart functional testing begins or can you see doing both at this? Tom Fanning : Yes. Paul Fremont : It does have to be complete? Tom Fanning : Yes sir. Paul Fremont : Okay, because if I go to your slide seven then -. Tom Fanning : So let's say we start kind of early September around cold hydro. I think that is what that blue is meant to do. We think there is probably a month difference between the start of cold hydro and the start of hot function. I mentioned cold hydro test about -. Paul Fremont : I'm sorry, you complete that cold hydro in a month. Tom Fanning : Oh gosh. We can complete it in 10-days. Paul Fremont : Okay. I just wanted to understand sort of the timeline a little bit better. And then last thing is, I mean, you talked about sort of looking at what staff is looking for in terms of scheduling versus what Sothern\u2019s plan is and the differences there. But I think what staff has said was typically for other nuclear plants, both in this country and other countries, it is roughly six months from the end of hot functional testing until fuel load and then another six months to commercial operation. So they are sort of looking at the body of nuclear plants that have come before Vogtle 3 and 4. What gives you confidence I guess in your planning process that you think you can do that more quickly? Tom Fanning : Yes. I mean, the simple volley on that logic sale is that they are using data that is more than 30-years old, you know, that is kind of the way they think about it in that regard. The more relevant way to think about it is what China was able to do. We originally allowed six months, China was able to do it in four and a half months, our numbers, and we have our own opinion. But the other thing that I might should have mentioned before, but I will say now Westinghouse is consistent between the work in China and the work here in the United States at Vogtle. And we get the benefit of their experience. And remember, we have always had people in China looking at all that experience, we have had our own people there. So, I think that is an obvious, in my opinion, and I hope they don't make anybody mad, but I just think there is a logic law that is you are going to make your estimate based on heaven forbid 1970s, 80s data world is different now, and we have a much better marker for experience in China than we do those projects. Drew Evans : Paul. I would like to clarify maybe one thing, because that may be helpful to other folks on the call, a Slide 7, this is an important slide for us. So let me help you maybe decipher it a little bit. The blue circle represents the aggressive site work plan and when those milestones would need to start the stay on that plan. It is not meant to be the duration between the orange and the blue, the orange circle represents the point at which we think that needs to start those activities to maintain the November schedule. Tom Fanning : And even the orange could be moved. You could start hot functional test later than what we show here that is a good schedule shot of what November would look like. If you chose to do November, you can actually start hot functional test much later than what we indicate here and still hit November. Paul Fremont : And hot functional test is roughly three months based on what you guys had talked about in earlier calls. Tom Fanning : It is two months, we used to have in there, Paul and what you may be remembering is 30 days of kind of management, but it is a two month schedule. Paul Fremont : Great. Thanks you. that is it for me. Tom Fanning : Thank you sir. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Bank. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Weisel : Good afternoon, Tom. I just want to echo, I'm glad to hear that you and your wife are feeling better. My first question is, if I understand your answer Sofia's questions, it sounds like most of the O&M savings in 2020 are going to be related to timing flexibility or short term adjustments in reaction to COVID-19. But now that we are a few months into the pandemic and modified utility operations, what is your latest thinking on how much it cost saving initiatives might be sustainable as opposed to one time? Tom Fanning : Well, listen, well you are getting some we are going to attack the question, you are hitting a very interesting question. Okay. How much of the O&M saving through Drew and were arguing about this the other day is deferrals and those are going to show up later 15%. So, 85% are captured and permanent is what we believe. Okay, only 15% is temporal. And that may be made up with what happened kind of at the summer, we get, a long period of warm weather or less than expected COVID impacts or not then we will turn that money on this year, it probably would be more vegetation management related and it would say deferral of outages because through explained it beautifully if the plants not running, you take an outage based on essentially, the time on turbans and things like that. If they're not running you defer the outage. Was that helpful? Drew Evans : And I think part of the question that you are asking, too, is that these will some of these things be made permanent. So, I don't know that that is necessarily a fair assertion to make. We built our budgets around what we thought was a complement of people that we felt we needed to operate our business or grow our business. And we have had to take a pause in hiring this year because we have to be responsive to customers and responses to shareholders. And so we have, we have waited a bit when we are outside of COVID, we might certainly make the determination that these are things that we still need to do. Now, there are absolutely things that we have examined. There are work groups that are working remotely now that are incredibly efficient that we might ultimately determine can work in that mode for a while, but I'm not sure we are ready to put a stake in the ground around 2021 or a non-COVID environment. So, we have had a little bit more time to operate the way we are operating. Tom Fanning : But he is exactly right. I mean, we are debating these things around the Management Council table as the CEOs of all of our opco and the major functional. It is a fascinating question. What does this tell us about a way to operate more efficiently in the future. I think we have gained on O&M I think we do lose by the collegiality of walking down the halls and working with each other. We are trying to make that up, with texts and phone calls and emails. It is not the same, but there's something in between that we need to capture. Andrew Weisel : Lastly, switching to midstream, not a huge focus of yours obviously, but in light of dominions asset sale and ACTB and cancels a few questions. Obviously, you have exited ACT, but I guess how committed are you to this business? Would you consider selling your assets or conversely, how would you describe your appetite for new midstream projects? And then lastly, would you consider taking capacity on MVP to diversify your supply sources? Tom Fanning : Yes, so let's dial the clock back to when we were just getting buffeted by all sorts of offers, if you will express in - right, but would there were, I think I have mentioned this before, whatever something like five different big deals that we were looking at, and then one came in at the end, there's almost five and a half, I don't know. We have never been committed in a kind of deep way to pipeline growth. So, what did we do? Go back and look, it was we bought 50% of the Southern Natural Gas system. owned by Kinder Morgan at the time. And recall that the reason we did that deal was we felt that natural gas generation, particularly in the northern half of our system, was inextricably tied to SONAP Southern Natural Gas Pipe. And if you remember that day, I think most everybody would say we bought that well, we got a good price. It was really important, I think to Kinder Morgan for us to say a customer. And so we were able to do that. I forget what our share is of that pipe is 50% or better of the throughput of SONAP comes to us. So there was this kind of notion of synergy and integration. The other thing we said that day was we viewed this as an annuity. It is a good annuity because we bought it at a good price. We did not include any expansion of that pipe in any of our financial plans. We have done a few things around the edges but nothing material. So here is my view. There was so much symbiosis between SONAP in our plans for generation and Southern, we felt like that was a smart bet. And because we were able to buy it well, it fit in very well in our portfolio, but it fits in as an annuity, not as a growth engine. In terms of our appetite going forward look, I just think that is an extraordinarily difficult business right now. And, I'm sorry for my friends, Tom Farrell, and Lynn Good on ACP. I know they work very hard to make that a reality. It was just the right thing for us not to be part of that. Drew Evans : And I would say the character of our midstream businesses is also very different. You touched on it with SONAP. But if we have never really been involved in gathering and processing. We have very modest storage representation, although we own a fair amount of storage within our LDPs. And the transportation leg that is the dominant piece of our investment is a primary supply source for our Southeast utilities. And that has a character that looks a little bit more like transmission and transportation than midstream in aggregate. Tom Fanning : And the other thing is, what is the future of gas pipeline? Look, I said when we did AGL deal that I thought gas was a bridge to 2050. I kind of blinked in that now to say boy beyond 2050. But in order to hit net zero. What we are going to have to do and that is what Southern does uniquely compared to any other company in our industry, is invest in technologies are going to be able to deal with the carbon atom coming off gas generation. We are doing that. There is no a national leader that compares to us. We run the nation's Carbon Capture Research Center, we run the International Carbon Capture Research Center. We are doing all sorts of other money where our mouth is activities to deal with carbon. That is why we are confident. As we think about the portfolio going forward, that we are investing in optionality, that is going to be able to keep gas part of the solution, but we will have to deal with the carbon atoms. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. And MVP appetite? Tom Fanning : I'm sorry, what was that? Andrew Weisel : Mountain Valley Pipeline? Drew Evans : I don't think so. That is something \u2013you would have to hear from our utilities directly from -. Tom Fanning : It is not a front burner issue though. Andrew Weisel : Alright. Thank you so much. Tom Fanning : Thank you, sir. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : I'm glad that and congrats on the company's ability to drove navigate COVID-19 the big projects and everything. But I wanted to ask you about a guest is footnote three in the release discusses, the last sentence discusses that there might be some potential future write-offs. And I was wondering whether or not associate with Vogtle? And that is what this is basically sort of boilerplate standard, safe harbor stuff, or is this something that we should be -is there anything more you would elaborate on that in terms of what we should be expecting with respect to that? Tom Fanning : I have looked through all this stuff. I don't that one doesn't jump off the page. It sounds like, we believe in conservative disclosures. We don't know of any exposure to future write-off in the future. I mean, we've given you everything. Is it possible there could be further? Paul Patterson : I got you. No, I just, noticed that and I looked a little, I just want to make sure. The other thing was on the leverage leases. It looks to me like you guys have written off the entire value those. But there is some language about how there might be a monthly or whether or not there is some additional obligations you might have with respect to closing it. Is there any exposure here that you think is material that we should be thinking about? Tom Fanning : What, I don't think so. I mean, in just to replay this one, this was, this is a legacy business unit, it was very important to, if you guys remember Southern Energy it started out Southern Electric International. In fact, I was effectively the CFO of that for a while. And then it became Southern Energy and then we spun it out and became merit in the spin out. We took over the leasing business. Those guys liked financial engineering. I don't like financial engineering never had. But the leasing business was kind of hot at one time in the world, because you could kind of structure net income. That was the idea. [indiscernible] was one of those projects. The reassessment really dealt with the terminal value of that plan and I think it has a power sale contract with TDA that expires in 32. We reevaluated, the terminal value based on what it costs we think to operate the plant in 33 and beyond relative to the market for this plant compared to say natural gas. Natural gas prices up 35% cheaper this year than they were last year. And therefore the assessment of terminal value went to zero. And therefore you failed the impairment test and therefore we wrote the whole thing off. Paul Patterson : Okay. I just wanted to make sure on that. And then with respect to the 150 million in COVID-19. It says COVID-19 in other costs. Is there any significant other cost that you call out on this? Just sort of what is the sense of how much it serves COVID-19 versus something else, I guess, and if there is something significant, what might that be? Tom Fanning : Why don\u2019t you pick up on that, we kind of drafted around that one a little bit or the 75 to 115 refers to COVID. Okay, comma, and then there are other potential costs. Okay. So what you are reading there, 75 to 115 is COVID and then there may be other things. And other things may go to the performance of subcontractors that may go to I don't know - per GN an extension and 21 beyond where we are now things like that. Paul Patterson : Awesome. So thanks so much for the presentation. Very helpful and glad everybody is doing well. Tom Fanning : Super. Thank you my friend. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Webber from Webber Research. Michael Webber : Thanks for squeezing us in. I just wanted to circle back real quick to a couple global EPC related questions. We specifically to kind of get our arms around onsite headcount and craft labor productivity, it is kind of in a pre-COVID and a kind of a post-COVID world or a mid-COVID world. And forgive me, I know you touched on this a bit already. So forgive me, if I missed it. But to be clear, is that headcount is currently onsite in line are enough to hit that May 21 in service day, and then maybe more specifically, had there been any changes to the underlying craft labor productivity assumptions used to kind of get to that timeframe? Tom Fanning : We are adding, we are a little below, so if you do, they're just the big numbers. We went from 9,000 to 7,000. Actually, we just below 7000. We are adding back now about a 100 of 200 new electricians. In effect, this is a summary of what we have said before. But recall, we move people off of unit 4 to unit 3, or adding back electricians to kind of catch up on unit four now, that is kind of the way you should think about it. So that is about where we are. The other thing that is kind of good is we think there's personnel available, particularly on the Gulf Coast and some other areas, the labor unions, yields, building trades and others have been terrific to work with here. Michael Webber : And then just to the second part of that, in terms of the underlying crap labor productivity assumptions that are kind of underpinning that May 21 data, there been any changes to those in a kind of a post-COVID environment? Tom Fanning : Well, it doesn't assume, so remember, the aggressive schedule is aggressive. It does assume improvement in productivity for sure. So, I mean, the other data point I guess, I can give you is if you just kind of extend where we have been with no improvement. We are trying to hit the 2% per month and the 1% per month, 2% associated with aggressive schedule, 1% associated with November. We are kind of hitting right down the middle of airway with no improvement. Let me assure you, we are trying to reach improvement. And the other thing I mentioned earlier on this call that I hope people remember. We are finishing up this tough part of electrical, that is the cable trays and pulling these gigantic cables and terminating them in very close basis. And remember, we refer to this in the language in the script. When we talk about losing the production. As we went to a COVID protocol, for example, said having an army of people in a closed space. We would have like no more than three people in a work space. So we couldn't make the amount of action done, just because we had fewer people there. That pushed out construct and that gave rise to the change in the assets. All of those are COVID impact. Worked hard to get it done, we will see. Michael Webber : And then, just specifically related to productivity related costs that is our - any other major contractors have any risk or cost share exposure there, specifically the thanks to productivity related costs? Tom Fanning : Yes, their fee is at risk. That is the big thing. And let me just tag on those guys. Brendan [indiscernible], Jack Future, Brian. Anyway, they are terrific. And Brian Miley, they are terrific folks to work with. We meet with them all the time. I'm in the meetings where we meet with them now the - our onsite team that [indiscernible] and others meets with him daily right. But there are monthly meet with Brendan [indiscernible] Jack Future himself. Come to the meeting with Paul Bowers, CEO of Georgia Power, me, Drew Evans is there. Our co-owners is there. Dr. Jacobs is there, the PSC stat, DOE is there, NRC is there. Everybody sees a completely transparent picture of where we are. And we think this is served us, so well. Michael Webber : Got you. Just dig into it in terms of - how exactly there is fee risks. Tom Fanning : Yes, I think that is a question you would rather ask [indiscernible] or even, boiler room kind of stuff. But it started successfully, incentives is a way to -. Michael Webber : Fair enough. Well, first of all, that sounds like a very big room with all those deal there, but I appreciate the color and thanks again for seeing squeezing in. Tom Fanning : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Thanks, everybody. These are unique times, aren't they? I think we are going to look back at 2020. And maybe the way we look back at 1968, or some other big years in history in the United States. When I think about the work being done at Vogtle 3 and 4 and the adjustments those people have made to continue to progress the Vogtle 3 and 4 site. It is nothing short of heroic. And they deserve our gratitude. And I think they continue to make great progress under a lot of duress. So, thanks for that team there. Thanks to our co-workers at [indiscernible] And all the subcontractors. I know it is important to you guys. We see ourselves now in the short rows of that process, at least for unit 3. And it is such an exciting time to look at the end of the tunnel and in fact see daylight. So we look forward to making progress in October when we meet back with you at the end of the third quarter. We will have a lot more transparency on what the summer did for revenues. And we will have I think a new estimate on what we are going to do this year. And on in terms of guidance, and we will have a lot more, I think visibility on where we are in 3 and 4, such exciting times. If we can just get our social unrest under order, and pay attention to making sure that not only the watts of our business are done well, but the house of our business are done well in a systemic way. Not in a periodic way. I think we will all be better as a company and as a nation. Thank you all so much for following us. We appreciate your time today. Operator, that concludes the call. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All lines have been muted to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 29, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Pema. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will provide non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the third quarter, ahead of the estimate provided on our last conference call. COVID-19 related demand impacts have moderated from the levels we experienced earlier this year. And given results through September, we expect adjusted full year earnings per share to be at the top end of our guidance range. Throughout 2020, our customers and communities have been faced with historic challenges, and our businesses have continued to demonstrate resilience in serving and supporting them. Well COVID-19 has resulted in many employees working from home, nearly half of our employees staff essential facilities and perform essential functions, which means they have been in the field, and in the case of our gas employees and homes and in businesses working daily to ensure the delivery of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. Safety and health protocols have never been more important to protect both our employees and our customers. Despite extraordinary circumstances in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and an exceedingly busy storm season, our business model has demonstrated substantial resilience, as we've delivered outstanding service to customers, provided excellent operational reliability and achieved strong year today financial performance. As we reach completion of Vogel Unit 3 and continue significant progress on Unit 4, we will set the foundation for an expected increase of our long-term earnings per share growth rate and improvement of our cash flow and a dramatically improving dividend payout ratio. Let's turn now to an update on plant Vogel Units 3 and 4. We continue to focus on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in service dates, and recently updated our work plan for the timing of Unit 3s remaining major milestones. Based on our current work plan, we now expect that the in-service date for Unit 3 to be during the third quarter of 2021 ahead of its November 2021 regulatory approved and service date. Now we continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan for Unit 4 as a tool to provide margin to its regulatory approved in-service date of November 2022 with a current targeted and service date of June 2022. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast is unchanged at $8.5 billion. With Unit 3 direct construction approximately 94% complete, our expectations around the scheduled ranges for reaching major milestones continues to narrow. For about three years, and as we have discussed on prior earnings calls, we have used an aggressive on-site work plan to drive productivity and as a tool to provide the margin to the November regulatory approved in-service date for Unit 3. Now, this strategy has served us well in motivating the workforce, advancing construction progress, providing early testing of systems and components and facilitating earlier identification and mitigation of risks. Indeed, this tool has created margin to the November regulatory approved in-service date. Considering the current pace of construction and milestones reached to date, as well as assumptions for future productivity, we are shifting away from the use of an aggressive site work plan for Unit 3; two, a work plan that reflects our current expectation. Under this updated work plan, we anticipate our next major milestone, hot functional testing to start in January 2021, followed by fuel load in April of 2021. That work plan projects in-service as early as the third quarter of 2021, which provides approximately two to three months of margin to the November regulatory approved in service date. It is important to remember that for Unit 3, we expect hot functional testing could start as late as the end of March of 2021, and fuel load could occur as late as mid-year of 2021, and still support the November regulatory approved in service date. In mid-October, we successfully completed cold hydro testing for Unit 3, which was a major milestone for the project. Since our last call, we also completed civil construction on Unit 3 shield building, started to successfully operate the Unit 3 reactor coolant pumps for the first time and place the Unit 3 turban on its turning gear. As the site prepares for its next major milestone, hot functional testing, critical areas of focus remain the timing of system turnovers and electrical and subcontractor performance. While the site is experienced and managed through two waves of COVID-19, we expect the pandemic will present continued challenges as we work towards completion. Now as we approach hot functional testing, system turnover and testing activities for Unit 3 continue to increase. And in the coming months, we expect ITAAC to middle and review to accelerate. Southern Nuclear and the NRC staff have been working together for years on a plan that provides Southern Nuclear the ability to submit the necessary documentation and allow the NRC ample time to conduct a review of that documentation prior to the Unit 3 fuel load. All of the UI ends or the uncompleted ITAAC notifications have been submitted and accepted by the NRC for both Unit 3 and 4. And nearly 40% of the 399 high ITAAC closure notifications, we call these ICNs, have been verified as complete by the NRC for Unit 3. At this point, ITAAC progress is consistent with our expectations and milestone achievements. Leading up to hot functional testing, we plan to submit over 100 ITAAC for review and verification to the NRC, followed by approximately 100 more during hot functional testing and approximately 50 more as we approach to fuel load. We expect that all Unit 3 ITAAC and ICNs will be submitted and reviewed in a timely fashion to support Unit 3 fuel load. The Vogtle 3 and 4 operations team continues in preparation for the initial fuel receipt later this year, and an increase in pre-operational testing. The team successfully completed the pre-startup safety review by the World Association of Nuclear Operators highlighting the Safety Strong Safety Culture we have developed to position the project for successful startup and operation. We also completed the NRC evaluated emergency preparedness exercise, and received 62 reactor and senior reactor operator licenses, the first operator licenses for Units 3 and 4. This number represents full staffing for both units. These accomplishments set the stage for the site to achieve approval for Unit 3 fuel load. Now let's turn to cost. Based on our most recent assessment, there is no change in the total project capital cost forecast. In the third quarter of 2020, Georgia Power allocated approximately $5 million of the construction contingency to the base capital forecast, reflecting cost risks associated with construction productivity and field support. Now recall, the estimated cost of the time between the site work plans and the regulatory approved November in service dates or a schedule cost margin is embedded in Georgia Power's base capital forecast. Following the update to Unit 3 and Unit 4 site work plans, approximately $90 million of this scheduled cost margin was utilized. The remaining scheduled cost margin and cost contingency combined represent approximately 18% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize all contingency funds as we progress towards completion of the project. Through the remainder of this year and into the first quarter of 2021, the Vogtle team will continue to focus on the final phases of Unit 3 construction, system turnover and testing activities, ITAAC submittals and our transmission -- our transit transition into plant operations ahead of Unit 3s regulatory approved in-service date. At the same time, a ramp up in construction production is underway for Unit 4 related to its major milestones in 2021. While there is still uncertainty, our current expectation is that when we reach completion for Unit 3, ahead of the November 2021 regulatory approved in-service date. Drew, I\u2019ll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials and our outlook. Drew Evans : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter. Third quarter adjusted APS was $1.02 per share. While $0.12 lower than last year, it is $0.07 above our estimate for the quarter. One of the drivers of this variance was significantly warmer than normal weather in the third quarter of 2019. The weather impact relative to normal for the third quarter of 2020 was a positive $0.04, last year was a positive $0.14, hence the variance. In addition, we had a modest decline in third quarter of 2020 sales due to COVID-19 resulting in a $0.09 negative impact, which we mitigated through diligent cost control and constructive state regulatory actions at our utilities. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in today's release and the earnings package. Year-over-year through September, the dynamics are very similar. For the first nine months of the year, adjusted EPS was $2.78 per share, which is $0.06 lower than last year. This year's milder temperatures through September resulted in a $0.21 variance in EPS when compared to 2019. COVID-19 impacts year-to-date have reduced income by $0.20, and weather impacts compared to normal added an additional $0.08. Despite these headwinds, we have substantially mitigated both weather and COVID-19 impacts throughout 2020, allowing us to exceed our estimates on an adjusted basis in each of the first three quarters. With the solid results through September, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be at the top end of our guidance range of $3.10 to $3.22 per share. We continue to assess the financial impacts of COVID-19 on our business. For the third quarter, the weather normal impact of COVID-19 reduced sales by 3% in the aggregate and slightly better than our baseline expectation. As you would expect, we are still seeing a slight uplift from the residential sector, due to people working from home. The trend for both commercial and industrial customer classes is markedly better relative to the troughs last spring. However, the timeline to full recovery for both sectors remains uncertain. Factoring in impacts across all customer classes year-to-date, our non-fuel revenues came in slightly above our forecast. Our retail sales projection for the full year is unchanged, with the expected overall decline in the range of 2% to 5% on a weather normal basis. Based on results to date, we expect total COVID-19 impacts to be approximately $300 million for the full year. In addition to sales, we are continuing to monitor customer arrears and the potential for an increase in bad debt expense. We have worked closely with customers across our regulated utilities, offering special payment plans for those with past-due account balances. Customer arrears have actually trended better than anticipated across our operating companies and our liquidity position remains robust. Constructive mechanisms have also been put in place by the commissions in many of our states, allowing us to address COVID-19 related cost and bad debt expense in future regulatory proceedings. Additionally, through the first three quarters of 2020, we are on target to meet our annual capital deployment plans. Turning to a brief capital markets update, during the third quarter Southern Company and several subsidiaries raised an aggregate of $3.4 billion, locking in record low coupon rates, increasing our liquidity positions and allowing us to redeem $1 billion of higher rate notes at the parent. Importantly, recall, we still forecast no equity need until at least 2024. From a ratings perspective, during the third quarter, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power\u2019s senior unsecured long term debt rating to be Baa1. Fitch also upgraded Mississippi Power\u2019s senior unsecured rating to A-minus. Lastly, Fitch moved its outlook to stable for all issuers except Georgia Power. These positive changes demonstrate the continued commitment of Southern Company and our operating companies to financial integrity and strong credit ratings, both of which provides significant benefits to customers and investors. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to highlight our energy mix trends so far for this year. Through September, nearly one-third of our energy supply was from zero carbon resources and coal represented just 16%. We continue to project that for the full year generation from coal could be below 20% for the first time in modern history. Last month, we published a supplemental carbon report for called Implementation and Action Toward Net Zero, in which we outlined our approach to achieving our goal of net zero by 2050. We've made significant progress toward this goal and currently project that we will achieve our 2030 interim goal of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as early as 2025. At a high level, we expect our path to net zero to be comprised of several key elements, including continued coal transition, utilization of natural gas to enable this transition, further growth in our portfolio of zero carbon resources, negative carbon solutions, enhanced energy efficiency initiatives, and continued focus on R&D for clean energy technologies. We do look forward to discussing these endeavors with you, as we continue to decarbonize our fleets in the years ahead. With that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks Drew. Adding to your comments and reinforcing the notion that Southern is the industry leader in research and development. The United States Department of Energy's Office of fossil energy and the National Energy Technology laboratory recently renewed an agreement with Southern Company to operate the National Carbon Capture Center, located in Wilsonville, Alabama. Through this $140 million agreement, Southern Company will continue to manage and operate the Research Center for an additional five years. Over the past decade, the National Carbon Capture Center has successfully advanced the wide range of technologies toward commercial scale, while improving performance and reducing cost. Southern Company is also partnering with African Gas Technology Institute to sponsor the low carbon resources initiative to accelerate the development and demonstration of low carbon energy technologies. And we recently received the Edison award, our industry's highest honor from the Edison Electric Institute for Southerns' work involving energy storage, research and development through the energy storage Research Center, and industry worldwide hub for battery energy storage, technology testing, evaluation and large scale demonstration in Birmingham, Alabama. Southern Company is providing leadership and technical expertise to advance energy storage, delivering a decarbonized future will require an influx of advanced technology. So it's essential that we leverage collaboration to find and advanced those next generation and transformational solutions. Despite unprecedented circumstances in 2020, our company and employees continue to demonstrate exemplary operational performance, which has translated into solid financial performance for the year today. As we move ahead, key priorities remain operating our utilities at best-in-class service levels, demonstrating cost discipline, and working diligently to bring Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online by the November regulatory approved in service states. We believe that Southern Company is well positioned to successfully execute on these fronts and uphold our goal of achieving an attractive risk adjusted return for our shareholders. In closing, earlier today Georgia Power, now that Paul Bowers plans to retire concurrent with unit three fuel load, expected in April 2021 after a remarkable 42 year career with Southern Company. For more than a decade, he has led Georgia Power to be the premier energy company it is today. From industry leading storm response and customer satisfaction to the growth of a diverse energy portfolio and a deep commitment to the communities we serve, he has positioned the company for continued success. He has led the company through the construction of Vogtle 3 and 4 and will be here as we continue progress at the site and begin loading fuel in unit three. The impact he has had on our company, its employees, our customers and our communities in the state of Georgia is immeasurable. At Southern Company we have strong leadership across our system and operating companies, fostered by our commitment to cross functional training and development. This is how we continue our long standing tradition of effective succession planning and cheering we always have strong leaders ready to continue serving our customers. I am very pleased that Chris Womack, our Executive Vice President and President of External Affairs will succeed Paul. Chris will serve as President of Georgia Power effective November 1, 2020 and assume his additional responsibilities as Chairman and CEO upon Paul's retirement. Now, we knew it would take a remarkable leader to follow after Paul, and we are confident Chris is that leader. With extensive experience leading at the national level, Chris has remained very active and well known in Georgia and across the South. He also previously served as Chief Production Officer and Head of External Affairs for Georgia Power. His depth of experience in the energy industry, government and regulatory affairs and the state will be incredibly valuable as Georgia Power works to continue providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for millions of Georgians. More importantly, Chris leads with a passion for people. The company, its employees, and its customers and its communities are in awfully good hands. One final note, we have thousands of people today working to restore power from Hurricane Zeta that came across New Orleans, but then hit the bulk of its theory and Mississippi, Alabama and even here at Georgia, where we experienced wind gust in excess of 60 miles an hour. My Report as of this call was that at our Mac, we had around 1.2 million customers out and as of 1 o'clock, we're now about down to 1 million customers. So, we've already made some progress. In the days ahead, I know that we will continue our excellent track record of restoring service quickly and not only providing electricity, but hope to the communities we serve. So, thanks to those people for their efforts, and I know they'll work safely. So, thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir. Tom Fanning : Hello Julien, thanks for joining us. Unidentified Analyst : Hey good afternoon. This is Richie here for Julien. How you doing? Tom Fanning : Hey, Richie. Glad to have you as well. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thanks. I was just curious if you can provide a little bit color comparing the timeline for the hot functional testing from start to finish with what you've allocated looks like roughly 60 days compared to the peer China plant where it seems like 77 days is incited in the news. And I know it might be a direct comparison given labor and other political items, but I'm just curious if you can provide a little context on the differences there? Tom Fanning : Yeah, well, honestly, the 77 days I think appeared in a magazine article, we've researched it. We can't see where that number came from -- that magazine. We -- I'll just say this, you know, we've had people at the plants -- site, [Indiscernible] as they went through these procedures, we had our own people there, we have people from Westinghouse there. And in fact, the people from Westinghouse that went through startup and hot functional tests, and all of that are now with us at plant Vogel 3 and 4. The people from Westinghouse endorse our plan to complete this test as we have laid it out. So, I don't know where that number comes from. We essentially plan for from the beginning of hot functional tests to kind of fuel load about 100 days, that's comprised 45 days of starting the test and running the test. And then 55 days from assessing kind of where we are at the end of hot functional test to fuel load that will include things like filing the last ITAC. And as we mentioned, I know there's been some conversation about the pace of ITAC tax. Recall, you don't file ITAC every month just because of the passage of time. We file ITAC associated with the turnover of systems associated with the accomplishment of milestone. And so as we laid it out, there's about 100 ITAC round numbers, that before we start hot functional tests that we will file during the test, that's another 100, following the test before fuel loads yet another 50. So, that's very clear I think. The other thing that I don't know, but I'm just guessing here may confuse how you start and begin or the duration of a test. We are very disciplined with what we're calling the start of hot functional tests. And that will involve the pressurization of the reactor area. There's a lot of activities that I guess conceivably you could say are pre-start activities, you could say, began hot functional tests. And maybe that's where they came up with 77. So, let me just finish it with the folks that were there in China are on site here, and they have been constructive and endorse our plan as we put it forward. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's very helpful. Appreciate the clarifying remarks there. And then just maybe turning over to Unit 4, I know you guys have indicated here that targeting June 2020, but in VCN 23, it looks like it's just slightly slipping behind the November schedule in terms of percentage complete per month. Just curious if you can provide a little bit of a color there on getting back on track, especially considering the remaining milestones needed to complete with Unit 3 here? Tom Fanning : Yeah, thanks Richie and in fact, it's really not off track, it's by plan. If you recall, when we went back to the onset of the COVID virus at the site, recall we went through essentially a lessening of density at that site and reducing personnel from say 9,000 to 7,000. That also required us to re-sequence work which we disclosed along the way here. One of the ideas that we put into place was to borrow -- as we brought the numbers down was borrow some personnel from Unit 4 and put them on Unit 3 so we could maintain the progress of Unit 3. We intentionally brought down the productivity of Unit 4 for a period of time. Now in order to achieve November by, no -- in order to achieve the aggressive schedule, for Unit 4, we need about 1.4% per year, per month, in order to hit gym. What we have done is in October achieved 1.4% on Unit 4. We're going to add more people as we finish 3 that will move over to the other unit and drive that number up. So yeah, it would appear that for the month of say, July, August, September that it looks like we really went down on Unit 4. We did that was part of the plan. And now we're ramping back up. And I think our productivity in October is evidence of that. Drew Evans : Sort of, an odd concept and you probably shouldn't use the idea of reduced complexity when you're referring to a nuclear site. But I think it is completely fair to say that, as we move through Unit 3 construction, and move the principal focus to Unit 4, that will absolutely see improvements in -- in productivity over time. It's just a natural course of construction. Tom Fanning : And just recall to that as we went through Unit 3, we had lots of learning. And so one of the things that we've been able to do on Unit 4 is apply those learnings. We see sequencing work. I remember initial energization, we did early on 3, we're going to push that on for and improve productivity there because there was frankly a lot of turn-on and turn-off of the equipment involved in that. Drew Evans : And Richie, as we move into or move through hot functional testing will start to provide you probably in the first quarter of next year, good sets of schedules for Unit work completion -- construction completion. Tom Fanning : And I really like on the material we gave you today. I guess it's page 6, it's just a great visual of where we are on Unit 3. You know, it shows the aggressive timeframe. It shows the November timeframe. And there it shows our actual, well, sure enough, if you look at where we're projecting our expectation to be, and our expectation actually has an additional 30 days that we already had 30 days of contingent -- scheduled contingency in there. We actually added another month, in order to hit the end of the third quarter. I think will provide that kind of information, as Drew was suggesting for Unit 4 now. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's very helpful. And then just one more if I can slip it in. I guess, in terms of the operational data points for Unit 3 between now hot functional testing, I know, there's some subcontractor work left to be done, but anything that we should be focusing on here in the next couple months? Tom Fanning : Yeah. I think there's kind of three things that I'm very mindful of right now. In terms of actual construction, I feel pretty good about that. I really think that our big focus, and we have a SWAT team assigned to this involves kind of the nomenclature of the paper, that is making sure that the as built condition of the systems that we will turnover actually reflect -- are reflected in the engineering plans. So if you want to just broadly call that make sure the paper works, that the as built, conform to the engineering, and that that goes into the itech that we submit them don't underscore that, I mean, that's a big deal. Don't underestimate that. Second, we have said consistently, really, through the past six months or whatever electrical productivity at the site continues to be a pacing factor. We think we have a reasonable schedule to do that. And then thirdly, is subcontractor performance. And I feel confident we'll get there. But it's one of the three areas we have particular focus on now. And what do we mean by that? It's like insulation, like the elevators need to be insulated before we can go through hard functional depth. So it's things like that. It's the seals on perforations through walls to make sure that they are tied up. It's a whole lot of myths that are involved in making sure we can get the hot functional test effectively. Those are the three things, like it's the same again, the paper, electrical and subcontractor performance. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Perfect. Thanks very much. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Continuing on. Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. How are you guys doing? Tom Fanning : Fantastic. How are you? Shar Pourreza : Not too bad. Not too bad. Drew Evans : You sound like you're recovering fully. So that's good. Shar Pourreza : Yeah. Tom Fanning : Absolutely. Shar Pourreza : Just a couple of just a couple quick questions here. So, you know, the cost contingency in this schedule cost margin came down to 18% from 20%, when it was replenished on a second quarter call. So 91 million in schedule, cost margin was used during the quarter, as you've sort of highlighted Tom, in your in your prepared remarks? How should we, sort of, think about the shape of the remaining contingency going forward for the remaining months? Is it \u2013 should we think about it more front-end loaded or vice versa? As we kind of look to monitor the amounts you'll be utilizing? So just maybe, for us trying to assess if you're kind of on track or not over the next several months as we're trying to -- to monitor the contingencies? Tom Fanning : Yeah, I mean, look I think we'll get there in terms of everything we know about cost right now. We think we'll use a contingency, and we see no reason to increase it right now. One of the things that gives us a lot of comfort, if you recall, go back to the call where we increased the estimate cost to complete, we actually funded through contingency, a lot of risks, both for Unit 3 and for Unit 4. So the landscape, if you will, a very abilities with respect to cost has really been reduced. Now, is there a chance that we could need more eventually? Sure, we don't know, we're continuing to monitor COVID. The estimate that we had given you so far, and moreover, the estimated time of completion that we now have guided you to, does take into account our experience on COVID. Could COVID get a lot worse, conceivably, but with the pace of COVID impact, that's the kind of estimate we've produced going forward. Little bit about time and so one of the ways that I've been thinking about it is \u2013 if look at fuel loads to COD, our budgets, our schedules are sort of 145 days \u2013 144 days, and we plan for something that's probably more like 110. If you compare those two, the Chinese averages, I think they were 138. The best was 112. I think our planning assumptions around fuel load to COD are very, very consistent with a global experience, maybe put it in that term. And so the answer to your question maybe is likely in the very near-term that we'll understand, where we fall between the site schedule and the regulatory and service date for unit. Drew Evans : Yeah. There is the \u2013 that's a kind of schedule breaking, right? We kind of watched that. I don't know, somewhere in October, November, it's somewhere in there, we have funded that. So we'll keep our eye on that as well, if we ever slipped past the third quarter. Substantially, I get that could have an impact on cost. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. Thank you for that. Just maybe just shifting from Vogel per second, just looking at the backdrop, obviously, you've narrowed your forecasts of load impact and the impact on revenues for the year, just maybe, how are you sort of thinking about the recovery into 2021 across the territory? I mean, we've seen and the reason why I ask is, we've seen in this space of, several players that you know, essentially have assumptions that are a lot more conservative, i.e., assuming a gradual recovery versus a V-shaped recovery. But the reality is the \u2013 the recoveries a lot faster than what's imbedded in plan and any sort of economic sort of forecasting there. So what do you think is Tom, what are you seeing, as we head into 2021 around that? Tom Fanning : Yeah. So look, I guess in COVID here, we gave the estimate of 2.5% to 5% load reductions, I'm guessing now, revenue reduction. I'm guessing now we're going to come in around three, 250 million to 400 million we're projecting now around 300 million. So, I think the estimates that we are using assume about a mid year recovery. And we are expecting, since we're down for the year, probably what drew 3% on revenue that we're going to recover back about 3%. Now, that puts us flat to 2019. But I would assume and if you, watch all this stuff on Squawk and all that this morning. That's kind of following what people believe about GDP. So that's kind of my expectation. Drew? Drew Evans : Yeah. The only nuance, I'd say is, we came out of the recovery a little bit \u2013 or came out of the pandemic from its depths a little bit faster than we anticipated, but the duration may be a bit longer, so that you integrate that and you get to sort of 3% for the year. If we see a continuation of that through 2021, I think both the mechanisms that we've put in place with regard to cost control have been very effective and will serve us very well into next year. We're likely not to see a cost base for the business that's materially different than 2019. And so I think we've got a lot of pathways should the pandemic prove to be depressive to revenue. The other important thing to note though and I think it's in one of our slides, probably page 11 is that the mix of impact has been very different, a little bit different than what we anticipated. Residential is quite strong, commercial was much less than what we had anticipated, although still negative, and industrial has been a little bit deeper than we thought. But as Tom talked about this morning, on Squawk Box, 8 of the 10 measurements that we're taking within the industrial sector are showing generally positive signs, sort of expansive signs through the third quarter. Tom Fanning : Yeah. And \u2013 let me just repeat that and a year over year all down, all the segments. But as I said, this morning, the first derivative, the momentum statistic would show 8 of 10 improving second quarter, third quarter. Hey, and that gives you the opportunity to correct something, I don\u2019t know, on Live TV every now and then you have a brain cramp. Becky asked me, which one was down, and which one was flat. And for some reason, I said, chemicals was flat, chemicals was down. I can't do that, chemicals was down, and that was the only segment down. Petroleum was flat. So I just misspoke on the call and said that chemicals was flat, chemicals was the only one down. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Tom Fanning : The rest of the answer was okay. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Thank you. Just one last one for me, if I may, just shift to annoy and just thinking about Nicor. Obviously, the policy down there is a bit of a disaster. It's a mess. And it's more of an electric issue versus a gas issue. But I know obviously under Pritzker's agenda, he did highlight a repeal of sort of the cliff that you guys have been utilizing. Just love to get your thoughts share with this thing, you find yourself in more frequent rate cases? Are you guys seeing any sort of traction with this part of his agenda? Tom Fanning : Yeah. So certainly supportive of anything that the governor makes as a priority within Illinois. What I would say about it is that our width is a little bit different than what they have -- what they experienced on the electric side in that -- the way the mechanism works, you have to move in rate case, something out of the rider into primary rate base. And so we actually do that with quite a bit of frequency so that we can absorb the continued construction under what we call QIP. And so even if there were a change at the state level, I don't know that it would necessarily change our behavior materially in the way that one we construct and two that we seek recovery from customers. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific. Thanks, guys. Congrats. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello, Mike. We're glad to have you. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Tom Fanning : Hey. Michael Weinstein : Hey, glad to be here. Hey, when do you think you'll be ready to quantify that higher expected earnings growth rate that you mentioned, after Vogel's and service? And what would be the first priorities for use of cash flow to achieve higher growth rates? Tom Fanning : Oh, listen, I think a lot of this is baked in. Let's just kind of -- we're going to get you great detail as we historically do in our end of year earnings call, which I guess it was in February. But it's stuff that we've covered in the past, and therefore I thought it was okay to foreshadow it. As you start, you guys know that there's essentially a penalty rate in which a lot of the Vogel investment is earning right now. And we've still been able to stay within our 4% to 6% growth rate, even with Vogel under a penalty rate. The worst year for that penalty rate frankly, is 2021. As we emerge from clearing Vogel into service, and that's why we thought it was worth talking about now that we're estimating, we are expecting Vogel to clear into in service in the third quarter of 2021. From 2021 on, we start to have large increases in earnings per share. And in fact, the numbers roughly are, as we move from a debt rate, roughly the penalty rate associated with Vogel into a full mix of capitals the net income effect is over $200 million. Now, let's think about that, I don't care whether you use 2018 as your baseline, or 2021 as your baseline, our earnings per share growth rate goes way up. Our capital, our cash flow goes up significantly. And as you would expect, our dividend payout ratio goes way down. And so people after me will have the decision as to what dividend policy they want to carry on from there. But we've said this on earlier calls, we'll give you a great detail in February about all this. Michael Weinstein : Great. And thinking ahead, after the post election environment, I mean, are you seeing any new willingness on the part of environmentalist to accept nuclear as part of the integral solution to the global warming problem? And are you still willing to consider additional new nuclear construction? After this -- considering all the hard earned, valuable experience you guys have gained over the years? Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael, not under my way. Hey, hey, I want to finish up on a CapEx comment too on the last conversation, we just have it. Yeah, absolutely. I would say one of the great thought leaders in America, a guy that was approved 98 to zero by the Senate, as Secretary of Energy was Ernest Moniz, he's on our board. He's published extensively, I think he has credibility on both sides of the aisle, it's very clear that nuclear needs to be a part of this nation's energy profile going forward. And I think we suggested on prior calls, that as a matter of national security for the United States to maintain a profile of consistent nuclear development, I think it's important to us all. And so you, maybe you just saw recently United States signed a pact with Poland to think about new nuclear development, we know that there is new nuclear development considered under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and UAE. So my sense is the United States will continue. Now, when we think about our projections, and we have some pretty clear plans about how to transition the fleet, our next nuclear unit is probably in the 30s to 40s would be my guess. So back up, how many years 8 years before you start those to get them in service? So somewhere in that timeframe would be my sense. Okay. The other thing that's important on new nuclear is some of the things that we are spending a lot of money on, a lot of brain power, but working with DOE, Bill Gates, he and I are on the Energy Innovation Forum or whatever it is, American Energy Innovation Council. This idea of, kind of the next generation of nuclear that is, the nuclear fuel may have the physical characteristic of not being able to melt down. And therefore you don't need all the containment structures and therefore you drive down capital cost and operating costs. I think there's lots of ideas; SMR. Look, I -- this nation has to stay invested in nuclear in the next 5 years, 10 years, I don't know whether Southern will be or not. Thank goodness for the Senate of the United States, we stayed involved. But I think we're going to have to stay there eventually. Drew Evans : One last thing I just wanted to say on the future of CapEx, in the future financial plan. As I finished talking, I kind of had a hint of what do you have to do? And my answer was we have to finish Vogel. If you look at our CapEx provided in the slide, it doesn't really have big placeholders for new stuff. What you see in there is T&D CapEx and some relatively modest generation CapEx. What we're showing you in my view is a pretty conservative, modest case. There's plenty of room to do more, to execute on $500 million a year placeholders at Southern Power, for examples in renewables. We don't have that. So when we show this forecast, it is a conservative forecast, in terms of what we must do to achieve. I want you to make sure you understand that. Michael Weinstein : Yeah, That\u2019s kind of what I was asking. So, I was just curious about what other kinds of projects you might be thinking about. I'll leave it there. I'll see to further questions. Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : I think your answer to that question though, is relatively straightforward. If you look at the content of our constructions over the next five years, something like the $38 billion to $40 billion worth $8 or $9 billion per annum, most of that construction is being done in the transmission distribution segment, which is I think a highly important component of our mix and a very durable asset base. And then over the next 10 years, we'll do a very large continent of environmental remediation. And so as we move through those, the next generation of spend is likely to be modernization of the generating fleet. And so it's pretty easy to kind of flush out what the potential for CapEx is over a longer period of time. Drew Evans : And I want to assure everybody on the call, when we come up with growth rates, we don't plug CapEx in order to solve to a growth rate. What we're showing you is a reasonably conservative posture with respect to investment. And so therefore there's probably outside. Michael Weinstein : Thanks. Drew Evans : You bet. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed. Drew Evans : Hello Angie, how are you? Angie Storozynski : Doing great. Thank you. Well, I have two questions. One is, so post 42 years at Georgia Power is almost unimaginable. But that change in the leadership has happening off the time when you're reading huge support from the commission. You have elections, the potential changes of the Georgia PFC. So how, how should we think about it, the ongoing support for the project, given the -- again, elections and the management change at Georgia Power? Tom Fanning : You bet. And thanks. And that's a natural question. So thank you for asking. Look, Paul turns 65 next year. He's had a terrific track record of performance and he works around the clock. We fully blessed Paul's desire to retire and spend time with his grandkids. He's got a home on the beach there in Pensacola. He's got a farm in Alabama. He is absolutely entitled to enjoy his time in retirement. When we think about the right time to do it well, we could've waited till later in \u201821. But you know what, all of a sudden in \u201922 now, we start filing the next triennial rate case. We start considering issues like prudence, and we thought it was a lot smarter to have somebody in the saddle well in advance of those issues, not as they are happening.  The other thing that I know Paul and Chris both did a lot of media today. I think it expresses a tremendous amount of confidence by Paul and us all to make his retirement effective with fuel load on three. I think that expresses a lot of confidence in our ability to execute from fuel load to in-service. And let me remind you, Chris Womack, as President of External Affairs, he had a very broad pallet of responsibility. Chris has been involved in all of the regulatory execution of filings and monitors and everything else. Paul served as the Chief Production Officer. He was in charge of generation at Georgia Power for part of his career. He was also in charge of external affairs at Georgia for part of his career. So what you're getting is, is arguably the top external officer we have in the system. Now in the CEO role at Georgia, he will do a terrific job. Q \u2013 Angie Storozynski : Okay, thank you. My second question is, so we've always told us that there's going to be some a couple of weeks of additional work between the end of cold hydro testing and the beginning of hot functional testing. Now, I was under the impression, that we're talking maybe three, four weeks. It's a little bit longer than that. Is this something that that you guys identified, during that cold hydro testing that elongated that period, in between those two steps? Tom Fanning : Oh, Angie, no, nothing at all. The cold hydro testing went fabulous. And in fact, it's kind of funny we got this argument, not argument discussion of 77 days versus whatever. We started doing pre-cold hydro test kind of well in advance of the final cold hydro test, such that, when we finally did the cold hydro test, it just a shade over one day to complete, because we had done all this work in advance, okay? What we have done with the expected schedule, is to give more time for some of this pre-work, so that when we get to hot functional test, it will go smoothly. Some of that pre-work involves the filing of ITAAC 100, kind of before. When I talked generally about paper, that is making sure the as builts meet the engineering specs and therefore, provide us a very easy way to use the UIN process where they already have been approved, to drop in the values and get things done in a very systematic way at the NRC. It gives us more time to deal with the paper. It gives us more time to finish with the electrical. Our pace of electrical is not dramatically different. There is a minor increase. But it is not dramatically different, than our experience that we've been having so far. So, what you see in the absence of an aggressive plan, it should lower the risk of getting to that day, and then executing once we do get to that day. Q \u2013 Angie Storozynski : Okay. And now completely changing topics, given that in this, the utility sector seems like, we have some sort of strategic app, they don't with every day. I know you guys are busy with Vogel. But would you have any comments about, potential ongoing consolidation, in the electric utilities industry, especially in the southeast? Should we think about it that once Vogel three is online, that's when you're ready to entertain any types of, future growth through acquisitions? Tom Fanning : Well, now, that's a loaded question. Angie, you've been with us for some time. So I'm going to give you the old response, it remains true. It is a fiduciary responsibility of all CEOs, to seek out opportunities, buying and selling, anything that will accrue to shareholder value is something we should do, okay? And we have demonstrated that, I think over the years. The simple examples for us would have been Southern Company gas, formerly Agio resources was a great by us. And then, when you think about the strategic sales, that we've done since then, be Elizabethtown, Florida City Gas, Gulf power, if it made sense, we bought at attractive levels and sold at levels that were unprecedented from a multiple standpoint, both in the gas industry and the electric industry. And so, we will continue to do that going forward. The big caveat that you rightfully point out is this, is that, throughout probably the remainder of time to complete for Vogel three and four, it makes a lot more sense for us to be doubly focused on getting that done well, and executing. After that, we'll have lots of opportunities to consider thing. But I would argue even after Vogel, we will still maintain that discipline. Q \u2013 Angie Storozynski : Perfect. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Go ahead. Q \u2013 Angie Storozynski : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question \u2026 A - Tom Fanning Thanks Angie. Thanks for joining us. You bet. Operator : And thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. A \u2013 Tom Fanning : Hello, Sophie. How are you doing? Q \u2013 Sophie Karp : Hi. Good afternoon. All right. No complain? Hope you guys are doing well also. Congrats on a strong quarter. And thank you for let me in. A \u2013 Tom Fanning : Thank you. Q \u2013 Sophie Karp : Well, a lot has been discussed already. But maybe if you could give us a little bit more kind of color on, now that you've done with cold hydro and you're moving forwards the hot functional testing. What are found the factors that kind of can push some date in between, January and March as you outline the excess range? So, what are the factors that can push it sooner or later within that range that we should maybe follow, or think about? Tom Fanning : Yeah. Sophie if it was me, I'm just giving you my judgment on this call right now. So I laid out three risk areas. And it would be broadly the paper. And then it would be electrical productivity. And then it would be subcontractor performance. I probably did those in order. In other words, maybe the biggest risk factor would be, making sure that the as built condition conformed with the engineering plan and making sure therefore that the process we've laid out on ITAAC will work well. So theoretically, if there's no material difference between what we build and what the engineering plans call for, then you should just be able to drop the values. In other words, the whole UIN process provided for the NRC to already say that the test was fair, the process to get to the test was fair, and therefore, all they really need to do is assess the value of the test. That's why we're able to accomplish so much in a short amount of time. So, I think it's really \u2013 and I think the as built condition is in conformity with the engineering, but you have to go out and prove it, you actually have to have what we call a field non-manual labor on the part of vector and Southern to work with our testing ITAAC team to assure that we have conformance in the test. You know, I think we all get high focused on turning the wrenches and connecting the electrical equipment. That is really important. And I can tell you, we have a whole room that we've been there, gosh, I guess every week now here at the last bits of this construction effort, making sure that that's going to go well. I would really focus on that one right now. But look, the others could, too. We could have a lack of productivity, we could have subcontractors that don't perform well, those three areas, I would really focus on the paper right now. Sophie Karp : Right. So it sounds like a cold hydro test went well, like you're pointed out and so nothing that you've learned from that or gather from that could be \u2013 could potentially delay hot functional test. And it sounds like that's not the case. Tom Fanning : Sophie, no, it went great. In fact, when we finally ran the test, you know, part of cold hydro was to pressurize all this equipment, you know, there's always a tolerance in a test. We went right through all the pressurization activities and only achieve something like a 10th of the allowable variances. I mean, we killed it on that test, it went exceedingly well. Sophie Karp : Terrific, terrific. And one last one, just to clarify the ITAAC\u2019s approval, should we expect them to sort of come in batches or kind of in a more of a straight line timeline towards the completion, is that something that we should be tracking? Tom Fanning : It does feel like batches. Yeah, it is lumpy and recall. I'm sure it's our fault. But there was some, some idea out there that we should see ratable monthly, you know, that's not it. Everything is associated with a milestone. So there are systems that we have to finish in order to start hot functional testing. As we finish those systems, we will file ITAAC, those are the first hundred. There are systems that we will test successfully through hot functional, that's the next hundred. And then recall, when we finished the test, essentially you dismantle a lot of the equipment, and check to see how it performed, you actually open the engine, if you will, and look to see how the pistons and the stock I mean, the spark plugs and all that other stuff perform. And sure enough, we'll file the final ITAAC\u2019s on that. So it will look lumpy to you. Sophie Karp : Got it. All right. Super helpful comments. Thank you so much appreciate it. Tom Fanning : Always good talking to you. Thank you for being on with us. Operator : Thank you. Continuing on our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hi, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hey, thanks for having me on here. Tom Fanning : You bet. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to just want to think about, you know, kind of look into the future a little bit for the period after Vogtle\u2019s completion here. Do you see any kind of incremental investment opportunities that that kind of come out of net zero carbon by 2050 goal that you recently announced here? How should we think generally about renewable spending opportunities across the southern footprint and can you give us an update on the sentiment towards renewable integration across your jurisdictions here and how our commission's thinking about the integration of batteries with solar here, just want to get touch base on all that. Tom Fanning : Yeah, so let's start with the sort of the long term plan. I think the United States certainly is adopting a net zero carbon posture. We were one of \u2013 I would argue that we were the first one to come out with low to know, I think that's equivalent to net zero. Net zero becomes important because it gives us flexibility on the very last kilowatts that we made to be carbon free. In other words, it might have been electric transportation, or it might have been more carbon capture on gas generation, if we are able to make net zero technology, either direct capture, biomass or hybrid, hybrid biomass. Those incremental kilowatt hours at the end of the tail to get to net zero are cheaper. Now, we need to continue to invest R&D to get there. If you look at the state of Georgia, for example, they have been out there in terms of a state. Remember, Georgia Power, I want to say was called out by the solar industry as the investor-owned utility of the year. And in fact, we had no mandate to do solar. They do it because it makes sense in the portfolio and is good for customers. Alabama recently has considered solar and put it into a special focus in some hearings that will be upcoming. I think even gas has some very interesting plans on net zero. So I would argue our state, certainly understand the idea. And our state had been so constructive in the past, in terms of balancing kind of an environmental need, with what's best for customers. I think it's going to be a great place to do business. And I think also, when you consider the role of batteries. I have said, consistently. I know this is maybe a little bit apart from some of my brothers and sisters in the industry. We are going to need some material science advances, in order to make batteries a comprehensive solution. We have to incorporate not for and maybe even fix our battery technology, but seasonal battery technology. Recall the most important renewable probably in the southeast, not wind, its solar. And you know that during the summertime, you get a pretty good profile for solar generation. But as you go to the winter months, you have a much shorter period, and therefore you need seasonal storage strategies. So we got to figure that one out.  In Georgia already, they have addressed considering batteries and solar as part of the solutions for the future. But I think for us to get where we need to be in for Southern the numbers are roughly 50% renewables, which is the lion's share is going to be solar. We're going to need some advances in R&D on battery technology. That's going to make us I think, get there. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Yeah, that's very helpful. Thanks for that. Tom Fanning : You bet. Jeremy Tonet : And then, kind of shifting gears here. Is there anything we should be thinking about in regards to potential changes on the Georgia commission as elections approach here? If there is a change, how do you think Georgia Power's position? I realize this is kind of a difficult question to answer, but just wants to know if you had any thoughts on that? Tom Fanning : Well, it's almost impossible to answer. I mean, look, this company has been designed over the years to thrive in any kind of administration at a federal level. If does Trump win and the Senate win or is there a Blue wave? I think Southern Company has the optionality, if you will and the credibility if you will, to do great under both administrations. Likewise, in our states, we have inextricably, intertwined our operation with the good, the well being of the communities we serve.  And I think on both sides of the aisle, whether it's Republican or Democrat. People understand that a healthy utility, one that is involved in something bigger than our bottom line, that we are inextricably intertwined with the communities. We're privileged to serve is a good thing for the state. When you think about our economic development and the role we have played historically, I think it has stayed forever, as a premise by politicians on both sides. Georgia Power is one of the great citizens in our service area. The same holds true for Alabama and Mississippi in the Southern gas utility. No matter what happens, we'll be fine. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That makes sense. Thank you very much. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Weisel : Thank you. Quick one here in terms of coal generation, the pie chart you show is really impactful and of course, consistent with the strategy toward decarbonisation. My question is, with demand down so much this year and milder weather, should we think about the reduction in coal and even natural gas and being temporary?  In other words, if next year, we get demand to rebound and it starts to look more like 2019. Would it be right to assume that you'd be running the coal plants more and the skew might look similar to how it did? Tom Fanning : Yeah. The premise of your question is 100% correct. So let's just go through it real quick, interesting thing, what I love about the data point on that chart about coal being at 16%. Half of that is one plant, Plant Miller in Alabama Power. I know it is a terrific plant, highly efficient, cheap energy, really good stuff. So the whole rep that is one plant. The entire remaining portfolio of coal at Southern Company is only 8% of our energy. What does that tell you? It tells you that it's back in the stack.  In other words, its marginal cost to run is more expensive than most of the gas that you see here. So what are some things that could sway it? One is the gas prices go up? If there was some ban on fracking, if for some reason gas prices spiked, you may see an increase in coal. If however, to demand moves up. So if you think about the stack of generation, if the demand line moves to the right, you will pick up more expensive resources. That's absolutely right. And that could cause you to increase your generation of coal. But the inescapable truth are that with environmental pressures, cost pressures, supply pressures, the importance of coal is waning in the portfolio of Southern Company generation. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then\u2026 Tom Fanning : Did I get it? You bet. Andrew Weisel : Yep. Yep. I think do you have sort of a pro forma, or what's your latest thinking on a pro forma energy mix say in 2023, when the two nuclear units are out? And do you have round numbers available? Tom Fanning : Yeah. I do. Yeah. I'd like to get my hands on them. If something like this, I think, depending on what it -- there's a little bit of an assumption there about what happens with environmental and what happens with coal and gas prices. But I think you're going to see something similar to this 2020 mix. Nuclear will go up a wee bit, maybe in a 2%. So maybe 19% would be nuclear something like that. Gas would drop down, the marginal cost of nuclear is very cheap. Coal depends on what happens with environmental. And that really depends a lot to a large extent on the elections going forward. If you have a blue wave, it may be that we would see perhaps tighter regulation and co-waning importance, but we'll see. The other big factor is you should see renewables increase in importance. And I think we're going to see particularly a Georgia Power, something like 2.2 gigawatts of solar, by 2023. It'll be a big deal. Now, whether we purchase it or own it. Renewables will continue a steady advance into the future. So right now, it says 15, when I took over it was zero. And this is where the company that round numbers. I know this is incorrect now, don't hold me to it. I used to say that we're a little bit less than the size of Australia. Australia has grown faster than we have. But we're still pretty big is the point to go from zero to 15. And the time I've been here is pretty important. And I think between now and 2050, getting to 50 is a big deal. So expect renewable to continue with steady increase in the percent and those renewables are most likely to be solar rather than wind. Okay? Andrew Weisel : Okay. Just to make sure I'm clear, though, are you saying that renewables will be more than nuclear as soon as 2023? Tom Fanning : I think that's a possibility. Sure. Yeah, you could see renewables get up into the 20% range. What's fun about that is to say renewables plus nuclear, if you're 20% and 19%, you're 40% carbon-free. And recall, we've also said, we set in place an interim goal of achieving 50% reductions by 2030. I think it's going to be 2025 anyway, could even be better than that. We'll see. Andrew Weisel : Sounds great. Thank you so much. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Thank you. Tom Fanning : Hi, Charles. Thanks for joining. Charles Fishman : You bet. You've answered all my questions on Vogel, COVID-19. I wonder if I could just ask one sort of long range strategic question. You have a situation where you got this nuclear capacity coming on in the next few years, you're building a lot of solar, you'll continue to build solar. Southern is in a mild climate. It makes a lot of us to live up more jealous, mild in the winter, a higher summer peak versus winter peak. In your discussion have you thought about the fact that you like do some electrification of space heating because you're in a mild climate, air source heat pumps are efficient economical, does that enter into your thinking with respect to net zero carbon? Tom Fanning : Yeah. Hey, Charles. I know I catch them great for this, There's no job electrify everywhere, gas will have an important part in the future. Don't get me wrong. But switching to electricity, it does make a lot of sense in many cases. Let me disabuse you of one point though, and that is a summer peak. That used to be the case. So if you did your research, it was probably old data. Absolutely, Alabama is a winter peaker right now. And what's fascinating about that is when you're a winter peaker, your reserve margin in the old days, when we were reliably a summer peaker you would have lots of warning about peak days in the summer, you could see heat waves coming, there was very elegant modeling about how that persisted and grew over the space of say a week. And you could really nail it. And what we used to say was you needed 13.5% reserve margin in the current period and 15% for the next two years in order to meet your needs. With winter peaking becoming a reality, particularly in Alabama, and with the penetration of solar generation not being available during the time you need winter peaks, right? At 7 AM in the morning roughly, you better have good storage, maybe that works, maybe it doesn't. And now you need reserve margin, they maybe in the 30s, okay? So it's a much different kettle of fish as we plan the system. Now, right now, what we see is one of the important issues, I really want to flip this over to Drew, because, Drew, as we bought Southern Company and as we bought AGL Resources, the CEO of AGL Resources really understands this conversion market very well. But I think the statistics for us right now is that heating loads, electric versus gas right now in the Southeast is about 50/50. And so I think the really interesting question is, where does that go? Drew? Drew Evans : Yeah, it is interesting. And I do carry a bit of a bias because of my background. And it does vary by climate for sure. The one nuance I'd say is that winter heating with electricity is a little bit more difficult to manage, I would say than probably an alternative fuel in that. It's not that our demand is greater in sheer megawatts as we've planned, but the volatility around it can be quite large. And so the peak requirements that you have to plan for a very high, it's exacerbated by exactly what Tom described, which is solar availability is lowest when we meet the highest peak in the middle of January at 6 AM on Monday morning as people prepare for work. The state though has done a good job. There has been very robust competition, particularly in Georgia between gas and electric, and where it makes the most sense it has migrated in that direction. And so as Tom described, about half of our customers across the Southeast utilize electricity as their heat source. In our Illinois jurisdiction, it's much more difficult to even contemplate that electricity could be an alternative to natural gas because of its efficiency, and because we really have to focus on reliability and affordability for that customer base, just as we do in the Southeast. And so, you will see continued electrification where it makes sense. But we have to be realistic about where those limits are for the particular customer that we serve. Tom Fanning : Yeah. Absolutely, Drew knows his stuff. Thanks. Charles Fishman : Yeah. No, that's interesting. I certainly appreciate in Illinois, it's not going to work. But I would assume the air source heat pumps are competitive in your Southeast region? Tom Fanning : In many and generally below the latitudes where Atlanta exists, and so it's everything if you move down into the plane. Charles Fishman : It's kind of in nat line, right? Tom Fanning : Yeah. It's kind of making across. That's what they call the nat line down here. Charles Fishman : Okay. Tom Fanning : We do see it. Charles Fishman : Okay, okay. Thank you. That was very helpful. That's it. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Charles. Appreciate it. Thanks for joining us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hello, Paul, always glad to have you with us. Paul Patterson : Good to hear. So all I have left here is, I just wanted to follow-up you on PowerSecure. And just \u2013 I know, you guys have been shaping the business over the years since you bought it, you've sold a few things and what have you. But you guys mentioned, you call out that COVID had negative impact on it. And I was just wondering, how should we think about PowerSecure? A, I mean, I don't think it is a big earnings driver. But does it have significant earnings change that we should think about in the future? And also, how does it look for you? You think may be that more of this should be sold, or just strategically how's it figure in the future? Tom Fanning : Yeah, we've actually put a bright young guy in charge of the confluence of Southern Power, PowerSecure and the part of Southern Company Gas it's called Sequent. Now, here is the issue, I think that we raise, COVID could have an impact, but it's because people are less likely to have people travel to their site to go get involved in the kind of things that PowerSecure does for a living, right. If you think about it in this iconic century old business model we have of large scale, central station making, moving and selling energy. You may recall, we bought PowerSecure as an idea that would position us to be able to influence through technology and working with -- changing customer requirements to essentially miniaturize that model, and put it on the customer premises. So make move and sell now at a Home Depot store, or at a defense installation. And you can imagine everything in between. We have and Paul you absolutely hit the nail on the head. We have been putting it into our fashion since we bought it that if we got rid of a electric lighting business, we got rid of a utility services business. We're really focused on that intersection of independent power generation. And kind of the equipment you would think about in the move and sell that would be proprietary switchgear and micro grids. I know this statistic is dated, but I'll quote it anyway. It's probably, what, two years old? That some magazine said that Southern Company in PowerSecure was responsible for something like 85% market share of microgrids in the United States. So when you hear about microgrids, most likely that's us. Now, I'll just bet those numbers have decreased over time. More people are getting into that market. But we remained by far the dominant, I think, solution for customers that can integrate all the way through that make, move and sell value chain. Some people will get in there with control equipments and some of them will get in there with distributed generation. But we are the integrator and, in fact, provider of all of that solution. The importance of Sequent is that, giving people control over fuel stocks, I mean, over their electricity production and all is really important. But they don't know how to procure fuel or be it natural gas or hydrogen or whatever it is, the people at Sequent can. And so, getting their capability to the Southern power generation centric and the PowerSecure broader equipment microgrid centric approach makes a lot of sense. Chris Kaminsky [ph] and our system is charged with making all of that make sense. And that isn't, excuse me, just a kind of arm's length little deal that we're trying to do in 50 states in the United States, I think we're virtually in every state in the United States doing that. One of the other big deals as PowerSecure\u2019s earnings are a virtual peanut, compared to Southern Company earnings. It is important that our host utilities learn what's happening on other people's features. You're more vulnerable to this approach. That is, miniaturizing make, move and sell. If you do have \u2013 do not have a strong cost profile, or customer service or reliability. Those areas of weakness for some companies are areas of strength for our offering. Now fortunately, in the south, we do really well with price, service and reliability. It we always say about PowerSecure is and really the union of those three efforts is, it is a -- it is an offensively oriented defensive strategy, whose value relies in its option value. That is, once those markets get some oxygen and take off, we will be poised to play hard and influence. That's our idea. But in terms of our financial matter, this doesn\u2019t matter. Paul Patterson : Okay. So there isn\u2019t any significant drag or anything that we should be thinking. Tom Fanning : No. Paul Patterson : You guys mentioned that there might be a goodwill impairment in -- even mentioned in the last couple quarters in your Q. And I just \u2013 hey, it seemed a little bit surprising in that, it seemed like it was COVID related, which I would think was sort of temporary. And I'm a little surprised that it might have an impact on goodwill. But, I mean, just in general, though, it sounds like. That's a separate accounting, sort of, an accounting or to factor something in\u2026 Tom Fanning : Yeah, Paul, I would say, it's kind of a -- I mean, it's a disclosure item. I think it's kind of a minor point. I think the real shareholder interest in PowerSecure is as I described. Paul Patterson : Right. Tom Fanning : This idea, miniaturizing make, move and sell for the future. Paul Patterson : All right. Well, power grids are picking up. So, I mean, there's a lot \u2013 I mean, microgrids are picking up. So it sounds like there could be opportunity. Tom Fanning : Hey. Hey, Paul, I guess you\u2019re right. They just had I think their best quarter ever. So, listen, when I say that, don't get the idea, we're going to increase our sale -- I mean, our EPS forecast on PowerSecure. They're just small. But they're doing well. Paul Patterson : Good to hear. Thanks so much. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that will conclude today's question and answer session, Mr. Fanning, I will turn it to you once again for your closing remarks. End of Q&A: Tom Fanning : Hey, thanks everybody. What a great quarter, such exciting times to have the progress at Vogel 3 and 4. And, just for everybody's benefit, I asked Paul Bowers to join us. He did join us on this call and I know Paul was CFO and knows so many of you wanted to call today. I just want to give him the space to end the call. Paul, what would you like to say? Paul Bowers : Well, thanks Tom. And I'll put context and the decision associated with retirement, and that's a major decision personally, but also you've got to think about the context of how it impacts the company. And as Tom outline in opening, our confidence in delivering unit three on or before our regulatory date of November is one of the reflecting points for me to make my decision about retirement. You think about the third quarter in that period in which we think it'd be commercial operation. So when I'm contemplating timing for leadership change for Georgia Power and as Tom and I discussed, the transition seen obvious associated with the fuel load because that's the signal in and of itself that we're about complete with unit three. So with that, and as we have disclosed that concurrent to us loading fuel in unit 3, we'll make the leadership change at Georgia Power, with a great leader under Chris Womack to take the reins as we move forward. It's been a great privilege and honor to be part of this team and serve in a lot of different capacities over the years. But as you think about Southern Company, and you think about what we had before us, the momentum continues to grow, and it's got a great future in terms of what we can deliver for not only our customers, but all our shareholders. And as Tom pointed out, I am getting old. So thanks. Tom Fanning : Okay. Hey, thanks, Paul. You've been a champion for your whole career here. He\u2019s been a great friend and an awesome leader for the Power. Any thanks everybody on the call. Great stuff. We\u2019ll talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes The Southern Company third quarter 2020 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Thank you once again. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Pema, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded Thursday, February 18, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please, go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Pema. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's year-end 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2020 that exceeded our guidance range. In addition, we have a solid outlook for 2021, and importantly, we are raising our projected long-term earnings per share growth rate. But before we turn to more on our year-end business update, I'd like to share some thoughts on 2020. In 2020, we essentially saw four pandemics : health, economic, social and political. Southern Company demonstrated excellence and resilience on every front, including prioritizing the health and safety of our workforce and communities, overcoming decreased electric demand while delivering both, strong financial and superior operating results, and continuing to address racial injustice and working with policymakers to advance a cleaner energy future. First, the health pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic was, of course, the first and primary challenge that we faced last year and one that continues to impact our communities today. From developing a pandemic response reentry playbook, that was ultimately leveraged by many peer companies, to setting up a medical village at the Vogtle construction site and making heroic progress towards completion of those units, we placed the health and safety of our employees as a top priority. So by taking care of our workforce, we were able to continue taking care of our customers. The economic pandemic. Beginning in March and April of last year, the world has experienced significant economic duress. Southern Company originally projected a $250 million to $400 million loss in revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions, we were able to mitigate the estimated now $300 million revenue loss that we have experienced, while still providing reliability and industry-leading customer satisfaction to our customers. As well, our long-term efforts with the states that we serve on economic development efforts continue, helping capital investment and job growth in the communities we're privileged to serve. The social pandemic. I am also proud of our ongoing commitment to foster racial justice. For years, this has been an effort of Southern's to focus on building a healthy culture. Even before the unrest last summer, we initiated an effort to donate $50 million to historically black colleges and universities. Last summer, I told you that meaningful discussions were underway across our company related to our actions and response. And while these conversations will continue, an initial outcome is that we have refocused our efforts towards a more holistic goal of diversity, equity and inclusion, ensuring that all groups are welcomed, well-represented, engaged and fairly treated throughout the organization. As an example of this commitment, the Southern Company Foundation recently announced a partnership with Apple, where each are investing $25 million to launch the Propel Center, a new digital learning hub, business incubator and global innovation headquarters located in Atlanta for students throughout the nation of historically black colleges and universities. And finally, the political pandemic. I also want to address the political discord that our nation has experienced over the past several months. At Southern, we have consistently prioritized working with policymakers regardless of political party, and we have been working constructively with the Biden administration for months. In fact, we have already engaged in matters related to energy policy, especially the transition to a net zero carbon future, as well as on matters related to national security. You'll see in the appendix a letter I sent to President elect Biden pledging our support. As we continue to engage with the new administration as well as legislators and regulators at both federal and state levels, our positions will continue to focus on energy policies that can enable a smart transition and be informed by our key objectives of providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. So let's now turn to an update on plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates for Units 3 and 4, respectively. With the start of hot functional testing expected in only a few weeks, we now expect a November completion for Unit 3. For Unit 4, we continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan as a tool to provide margin to the regulatory approved November 2022 in-service date. Unit 4's current site work plan targets a third quarter 2022 in-service date. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $176 million, largely reflecting estimated COVID-19 impacts and other costs, along with a replenishment of contingency to fund future expected risks that will include lower productivity rates and increased support costs. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $131 million during the fourth quarter. 2020 marked another year of significant progress at the site. Throughout the year, as some other major projects around the country were shutting down or delayed due to COVID-19, Georgia Power and the Vogtle site team worked tirelessly to implement measures to keep the project progressing while prioritizing the safety of our workforce and the surrounding community. Similar to what was experienced across much of the United States during the last two months of the year and earlier this year, we saw a surge in COVID-19 cases at the Vogtle site, which, as you can see on Slide 6, peaked around the beginning of January. Since the onset of the pandemic and most acutely during the fourth quarter of 2020, the impact from COVID-19 have included high absenteeism and disruptions to planned or ongoing work as we isolated personnel. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately three to four months, consuming much of the remaining margin to the November 2021 in-service date for Unit 3 and several months of margin for Unit 4. Unit 3 direct construction is now approximately 98% complete, and hot functional testing is expected to start in the coming weeks. On our last call, we identified three key risk factors to our timeline : electrical productivity, subcontractor performance and what we call paper closure. Recall, paper closure relates to the turnover of systems to the testing group to help ensure that the as-built condition of the plant meets design specifications. Over the past few months, COVID-19 has hurt site productivity, negatively impacted electrical production and impaired our ability to close paper issues that facilitate timely system turnovers and ultimately, ITAAC submittals. The combination of these factors has delayed system turnovers and impacted our timeline for the start of hot functional testing. Based on our recent production trends, we now expect to start hot functional testing during the second half of March and start loading fuel during July. Starting hot functional testing, and fuel load on this time line would support a November 2021 in-service date with up to one month of flexibility remaining in the schedule. Now certainly, risks remain to this schedule. These risks may be thought of in four segments : first, the completion of system turnovers leading up to hot functional testing; second, the successful completion of hot functional testing; third, the completion of system turnovers leading to fuel load; and fourth, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient startup of the unit. Successful completion of hot functional testing this spring would significantly decrease the remaining operational risk to Unit 3 completion, although certainly, challenges and risks will remain in focus as we focus to fuel load. ITAAC submittal and review is expected to continue to accelerate and will remain an area of focus. To date, 180 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We expect approximately 20 additional ITAAC to be submitted by the start of hot functional testing and the remaining 200 to be submitted during hot functional testing and as we approach fuel load. Direct construction for Unit 4 is now over 75% complete. Last month, we started integrated flush, and we expect initial energization to occur during March. To support the November benchmark, we will need to average construction completion of approximately 1.5% per month, which is in line with the average rate achieved during the period from last November through January. As we progress in 2021, construction production is expected to increase in support of our upcoming testing milestones. And importantly, as Unit 3 nears hot functional testing, we expect to shift additional resources to Unit 4 to increase our current pace of construction completion. Now turning to cost. During the fourth quarter, Georgia Power allocated its remaining contingency, plus an additional $5 million and subsequently added new contingency of approximately $171 million to support completion of the project. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately three to four months at an estimated cost to Georgia Power of between $150 million and $190 million. This cost is embedded in our updated total project cost estimate. While COVID-19-related impacts were significant drivers of the change of our capital cost forecast, future risks, including construction productivity, were contributing factors. Earlier this week, the Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved VCM 23, which included project capital costs through June 30, 2020. As a part of the order, Georgia Power was directed to work with the PSC staff to develop a mutually agreeable recommendation to the commission by the end of March regarding the process, timing and substance of filings related to the transition of Unit 3 costs into base rates. Additionally, Georgia Power files VCM 24 today. The months ahead represent a critical and exciting time for Vogtle. The project team has worked tirelessly amid conditions none of us could have imagined just a year ago. Our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners should be commended for their perseverance and dedication to the completion of this important project. Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update of the financials and our outlook. Drew Evans : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all safe and healthy. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong year in 2020 despite the many challenges we faced. For the full year, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, $0.14 higher than last year and $0.03 above the top of our guidance range. 2020 was certainly defined by milder weather and sales impacts due to COVID-19, and we were able to substantially overcome both, as evidenced in our solid results. Looking at the details. Retail electric sales on a weather-normalized basis were down by $0.14 year-over-year, including impacts related to COVID-19, offset by customer growth. Milder temperatures throughout 2020 resulted in an additional $0.21 negative earnings per share variance, as compared to the prior year. We substantially mitigated both weather and COVID-19 impacts through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions as well as continued investment at our state-regulated utilities. On a combined basis, these factors allowed us to exceed our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2019 is included in today's release and earnings package. COVID-19 impacts reduced our projected weather normal kilowatt hour sales by 3% for the year. The slight uplift from the residential sector persisted throughout 2020 with more people working from home. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see improvement in kilowatt hour sales for both the commercial and industrial customer classes. However, we do not believe we have seen a full recovery in these sectors yet. Factoring in impacts across all customer classes, our non-fuel revenues declined by approximately $300 million, which was at the lower end of our original estimates as the pandemic began. As Tom mentioned, an important part of our COVID-19 response was, and continues to be, supporting our customers. We have worked closely with customers across our regulated utilities, offering special payment plans for those with past due account balances and have delayed disconnects. You can see the impact of our COVID-19-related protocols for disconnects in our customer counts for the year. Last year, our state-regulated utilities added just over 53,000 new residential electric customers and nearly 30, 000 residential natural gas customers. Our electric customer growth was approximately 30% higher than our expectations. Overall, we estimate that about 80% of the residential electric customer growth in 2020 was due to continued and accelerating in migration to the region, particularly in Georgia. The remainder is likely related to the steps we have taken to keep customers connected during the pandemic, particularly through the use of extended payment plans. During this time, customer arrears have tended better than we anticipated across our operating companies. We also have constructive mechanisms approved by the commissions in many of our states, allowing us to address incremental COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense. Those will be considered in future regulatory proceedings. In a trend that differentiates our service territory, the pandemic has strengthened population and job growth in the Southeast, particularly in Georgia, which is one of the fastest-growing states in the United States. Robust economic development in the Southeast region is also a positive indicator that our key states are weathering the pandemic relatively well. In 2020, we saw new investment of nearly $6 billion and nearly 25,000 jobs created across Georgia and Alabama. In fact, Georgia was the number two state in the country for job creation in December. And just last week, Microsoft confirmed Atlanta as a major East Coast hub, which is expected to bring significant job growth and investment. Our state-regulated operating companies play an integral role in leading economic development efforts in each of their states. Turning now to our expectation for 2021. Our guidance range for the year is $3.25 to $3.35 per share. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect \u2013 we estimate that we will earn $0.84 per share. Included in our full year guidance is an assumption that we will see modest impacts \u2013 continue to see modest impacts on retail sales from COVID-19, which we expect to continue to mitigate through thoughtful cost control. Additionally, we expect total retail sales growth normalized for any short-term COVID-19 impact to be flat to 1%. For this foreseeable future, this expected growth rate is driven by a combination of customer growth and ongoing improvements in energy efficiency. Moving now to our outlook for long-term growth. We see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with adjusted earnings in the range of $4 to $4.30 per share by 2024. With 90% of total projected earnings over the five-year plan horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Likewise, our history of constructive regulation, stable credit metrics and ongoing focus on cost control serve to underscore the achievability of our plan. Looking more closely at our long-term capital investment plan, we continue to allocate 95% of our capital investment to our state-regulated utilities. Our capital investment plan of $40 billion for 2021 through 2025 includes annual projected rate base growth at our state-regulated utilities of greater than 5% with a continued emphasis on transmission, transportation and distribution, modernization and resilience. For Southern Power, the cumulative five-year investment plan is comprised entirely of previously approved renewables projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet, which is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power are expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded and credit-neutral. Importantly, this CapEx projection for the whole company does not include amounts for accelerated fleet transition and any associated transmission growth, nor does it account for new generation projects at Southern Power. We will be evaluating a number of paths over the next few years as it relates to the fleet transition, but we do not establish placeholders in our plan with virtually all projects being known in the process of, or having already been engineered, or have already begun. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we currently forecast no equity needs over our five-year plan horizon, even when considering the potential increase in capital investment I just described. We believe we are well-positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and to improve our credit metrics materially during this time. I'll highlight that, in January, we became the first large-cap utility in the U.S. to publish a sustainable financing framework and the days that followed Southern Power issued a five-year green bond under that framework that resulted in a record low coupon rate. This framework highlights Southern's ongoing commitment to a wide range of sustainability and social issues and should allow us to leverage our work in these areas to help optimize our balance sheet and benefit our customers. We will also continue our focus on societal priorities in the upcoming years. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to echo his opening remarks. The resilience of our business has demonstrated amid the pandemic is a testament to the hard work our employees put forth every -- each and every day. The ability of our employees to continually provide outstanding service to our customers, combined with the support of our communities and the constructive relationships we maintain with regulators and public officials, underpin our ability to also deliver such solid performance. I would like to particularly thank the people who work for, and on behalf of, the customer -- our customers to meet our priorities even in light of a global pandemic. We are all grateful. Thank you. Tom, I'll turn it back over to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Drew. I'd like to circle back to your comments on fleet transition. Southern has two primary goals related to our greenhouse gas emissions. The first is to achieve zero -- net zero emissions by 2050. We will work constructively with the Biden administration to accelerate this time frame, as national policy evolves. The second one is to put in place an interim milestone to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. Regarding the intermediate goal, we achieved our 2030 goal in 2020, with preliminary greenhouse gas emissions now down 52%. Now, certainly, 2020 was an unusual year, and we may see emissions reductions move around 50% for the next two years, but we believe we'll be sustainably above our 50% reduction level by 2023. While ESG issues have received increasing attention by investors over the past few years, at Southern Company, these issues have consistently received the heightened attention they deserve, and it's being recognized. We were once again ranked as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. The DiversityInc rated us as a top company for ESG. And for the fifth consecutive year, we've received a perfect Corporate Equality Index score by the Human Rights Campaign. In addition, we're very proud of the A- rating we recently received from the Carbon Disclosure Project for our environmental transparency and leadership. We recognize the value our investors and stakeholders place on transparency, and we are committed to continued enhancements. And before closing, I want to just take a moment to recognize our leadership transition announcement that we made at the end of last year. My trusted friend and one of my closest confidantes, Mark Lantrip, plans to retire in April after dedicating 40 years to Southern Company. Mark has helped position Southern Company as a leader that is building and shaping the future of energy. We are grateful for the many contributions Mark has made to our business, and we'll miss him dearly and wish him all the best. Mark is passing the baton to Chris Kaminski, who has been a valued member of the Southern Company leadership team for many years, holding key positions at both Georgia Power and Southern Power. In closing, over the past decade that I have been privileged to serve as CEO of Southern Company, I can think of no other year that I've been prouder of the way we've conducted ourselves and managed our business. Our engagement with and empathy for our employees, customers and communities in 2020 demonstrates our enduring commitment to be a citizen wherever we serve. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Julien, how are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning. Hey, buddy. Hey, thanks for the time. Congrats, guys. So maybe just to kick things off on a light basis. $5 to $7, how are you thinking about the base here? You guys gave the $4 to $4.30 number, but can you talk about what's the baseline year for that? And then if I can throw it in there at the same time, that five to seven, how are you thinking about upside CapEx, perhaps some of the spending opportunities that exist in a, shall we say, post-Vogtle world, as you think about this transition? How does that fit against the numbers you guys gave today? Tom Fanning : Yes, man. You bet. We did it a little bit differently this year. The way you should think about the base here is kind of a 2024 number. That is $4 to $4.30 and then kind of reverse engineer back from that at the kind of top end of that range at a growth rate of 7% and the bottom end of that range at kind of 5%. That's how we come up with 5% to 7%. Certainly, as we move from 2021 to 2022, there's a step change, but I think you can see the math from there. With respect to that range, it's fascinating. As Drew pointed out, and I've said this before on other calls, the way we do CapEx forecasting, in my opinion, is really conservative. What we put out there, I know some companies \u2013 I shouldn't say this, but perhaps some companies use CapEx forecast to plug to a growth rate. We do almost the opposite. We only put in our CapEx forecast what we know or what we firmly expect, and we do not put in placeholders. So what is absent in that CapEx forecast is capital allocated to future projects at Southern Power. You know that we allocate, on current practice, about $0.5 billion a year to that business unit but none of that is showing up in the CapEx forecast. Certainly, as you look at fleet transitions that I think, from a policy standpoint, are being pushed in Washington, you will see growth in renewables. And it wouldn't surprise me that there will be plenty of opportunities to do more solar and wind in the future. Right now, we think those markets are very tough. So we elect not to put anything in the forecast. Secondly, we don't include any fleet transition. I think it's been very clear and I've been in the press here recently, talking about the transition of the fleet and working with the Biden team to think about how to move net zero 2050 to something sooner. I know President Biden, now would like to put out a marker of net zero by 2035 for this industry. We certainly \u2013 I think we can certainly achieve that. There are certain policy choices that will have to be made along the way, but we are engaged constructively in that conversation. If you go to something like that, I think you will accelerate fleet transition. Again, nothing in this CapEx forecast is reflected, associated with any of retiring coal plants sooner and building more renewables or more gas assets in this time frame. Drew, what else would you add? Drew Evans : I think the only thing I'd supplement maybe, Julien, is that if you kind of look at our historical performance, go back as far as 2018, we've been clearly growing rate base and growing earnings in sort of the 4% to \u2013 5% to 7% range historically. We've had some changes in that pathway a little bit because we've taken penalty for Vogtle construction. We'll see a little bit of that change as we move Vogtle into service. And so you get a bit of a [lag] [ph] in the way our growth rate might be delineated on a linear basis. But what we're really trying to express is a longer-term potential for the business as we invest capital into it. Then I think the other important point that Tom made is that we have quite a bit of generation modernization to do that we have not yet quantified, because I think there are a number of ways that that could play out. If you think about broadly what that looks like, we've got about 10 gigawatts of coal fired facilities in aggregate. We'll have to find some method of meeting the reliability requirements of our customer base without relying on coal as a primary source of megawatt hour production. And so I think we'll -- over the next couple of years, we'll take stock of emerging technology, different things that work within our system to meet the goals that we have, and we'll kind of lay those out for you as they reveal themselves to us. Tom Fanning : Hey, one other point, Drew, is -- and I didn't mention this one, I'll bet you there's at least another $1 billion of transmission. So when we talk about transitioning the fleet, it isn't just choices in generation, which we think we'll have. We do believe that there will be additional transmission associated with this transition that will occur. I see that easy to achieve over this five-year period. One last thing, and I'm not often doing this, but complementing the analyst community, you guys have done the math. If you back out this penalty period, we have been earning about 6% EPS growth once you exit that period. And so that actually creates a nice line going into the future. Julien, anything I didn't cover you wanted? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Listen, so let me clarify that, if I can, when does some of this CapEx start hitting, right? Whether the transition on generation, when you guys have this 4% rate base trajectory through 25? Tom Fanning : Yeah, I mean\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: It seems like that already translates to the 5% to 7%. When you actually get this CapEx uplift, it sounds like that drives you higher within that 5% to 7% range, as I'm hearing you, right, as you get some\u2026 Tom Fanning : Yeah. So you know, and you all know that we never try to get ahead of our regulatory processes, and each of our states follow their own version of an integrated resource plan. And so as we file those plans and file, whether it's RSE in Alabama or the three-year rate case at Georgia or PEP in Mississippi, that we'll make those plans known and approved by the commissions as appropriate. The other thing you should know is that heading into this call, I guess, we showed 4% for electric, it was 5% probably a week ago, it's rounding, okay? So it's in the middle of 4% to 5%. The gas business is growing at like 10%. And so the overall support the growth trajectory, that is supportive of 5% to 7%. And you're right. When you think about starting with $4 to $4.30, there is upside to a mid-range forecast there based on how we deploy capital over time. But I think even with the base forecast that we're showing you today, we're within that range, and we're comfortable at 5% to 7% within that range in 24. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. Absolutely, great. Thank you to clarifying that all. Best of luck guys. Talk soon. Tom Fanning : Thank you so much. Appreciate you calling in. Operator : Thank you. And up next, we have a question from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead sir. Tom Fanning : Hey, Steve. How are you? Steve Fleishman : Thank you. Hi, Tom. Good afternoon. So just a question, if you end up determining that you cannot meet the November deadline for Vogtle for some reason, could you remind us like do you have to -- what do you have to do with anything then? Do you have to make a filing, or is it just \u2013 you just \u2013 just update the schedule? Tom Fanning : That's right. We'll just update the schedule. And certainly, I think we're pretty good about letting people know when things change. We did the press release with the expressed intention of moving off of what we had thought, I guess, back in October, may have been July HFT. As this third wave of COVID hit, it really did just knock us for a loop in terms of productivity and pushed us now. And actually, the numbers continue to move just a wee bit, but it puts us from February now into March. No, it really just has a function of cost, Steve, and it really depends on when you incur the costs, okay? So if it is a delay that causes us to get into hot functional tests, the amount of both units in Georgia Power dollars is about $40 million. If it's items \u2013 I mean, Unit 3 only, it's about $25 million. If, however, we shift, and it is a delay kind of from fuel load to in-service, in other words, it's some punch list that causes us to have a delay in the in-service declaration of a unit, it goes way down. For both units, it's $25 million a month. For Unit 3, it's only $10 million a month. So depending on when the delay occurs, there would just be an additional cost that we're factoring in. And I will say that with this now new estimate on estimated cost to complete, this $176 million we've added this time, it includes a November in-service for both units. It includes a CPI number that is like 1.8. It includes a construction per month that is consistent for Unit 4 with our experience from November to January. Now my hope is that we can improve on those numbers but we wanted to put out what we thought was a thoughtful and kind of reasonably conservative estimate so we wouldn't have to come back to this number again. No assurances that won't happen, but that's where we are. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Tom Fanning : Steve I think\u2026 Steve Fleishman : So I know there\u2019s November\u2026 Tom Fanning : I think the only thing mechanically that occurs is that we continue to function under a penalty ROE until we bring the unit into service, and so that would be the material thing to model. Drew Evans : That's right. You start losing that penalty rate once you declare in service. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So because I know for a long time, we've had November as this like regulatory approved deadline. If there's a new deadline or whatever, you don't need to kind of go back and seek a new deadline or anything like that. You just finish it and go through the VCM process? Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. There's nothing special. The VCM process we've been filing has been really effective at kind of handling those issues. And as you guys know, you follow those VCM filings very clearly. That's kind of the way we would handle it. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then 1 other just quick Vogtle question. I think there's a new \u2013 or there's going to be a new chair of the NRC. Does that matter at all for you in terms of your timing process? I doubt that they're too much in the weeds of everything. But... Tom Fanning : Oh, no, I would argue. Hey, look, Steve Kuczynski and I visit with each of the NRC commissioners regularly. And we're very happy with Chris Hanson. We were very happy with Kristine Svinicki. My sense is Chris Hanson will, I think, run an NRC consistent with the principles of Svinicki. Hanson has experience in a variety of fronts in Congress with Dr. Ernie Moniz, who's on our Board. We know him well, and we think he will be terrific. The NRC yeah -- the NRC is a very tough regulator, but we think they're very fair, and they've been very constructive in their treatment of Vogtle 3 and 4. Steve Fleishman : Great. Thanks so much. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir. Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael, glad to have you with us. Michael Weinstein : Yeah. Glad to be here. So the -- just to follow-up on Julien's question, so the 4% rate base growth profile for electric, and if I look at that overall, I'm just thinking that once you get to the 2024 range and the penalties are out, right, the -- moving into penalties is the main driver of 5% to 7%, I'm guessing through 2024\u2026 Tom Fanning : Yeah. That\u2026 Michael Weinstein : Yeah. Tom Fanning : Yeah. Michael, excuse me those penalties will expire as we move to in service for the units. They expire by degree. So in effect, once we declare Unit 3 in-service and then Unit 4 in-service, we actually have a step change in growth that we're really not saying a whole lot about. The 5% to 7% is what we think we can sustain and have sustained over recent history without this step change in the Vogtle uplift moving in the rate base. Michael Weinstein : Okay. I mean, because I was thinking that the 5% to 7% is simply sustained by increasing the CapEx profile and increasing the rate base growth profile once\u2026 Tom Fanning : It is a sustainable growth rate beyond the uplift from Vogtle. Michael Weinstein : It sounds like it actually any -- yeah. I'm thinking any increase in renewable CapEx or recognization CapEx actually improves on that 5% to 7% versus\u2026 Tom Fanning : Yes, It would, absolutely. Drew Evans : Mike, we\u2019re pretty focus the durability of spend, I think, is the way we think about it, and so trying to extend the 5% to 7% range as long as we can. The -- if you sort of draw the line between what we've laid out today is our earnings expectation for 2021 and then take a look at our projection for 2024, you can see that sort of falls without -- outside of the range that we've intimated at 5% to 7%. We think of that really as being more of a longer term growth -- sustainable growth rate in absence of single large project risk. Tom Fanning : Yeah. And then the way you should think about it is almost a reverse engineer. Start with what we're thinking about is a reasonable range with this CapEx forecast for 2024 and then reverse engineer backwards using 5% to 7% growth rate. We think that's the right way to think about this. Michael Weinstein : And it looks like most of the increase or almost one-third of the increase in CapEx in this new plan is at Southern Power. That's this year. And is that just a function of you just not wanting to put placeholders in there? So each year, you'll simply have a major increase around the same amount for? Tom Fanning : No. And I'd say in particular to Southern Power, it was more that we had earmarked capital in 2020 that was committed but not yet in place. We'll actually deploy that capital in 2021, which increases the expenditure. But if you look at it over a longer period of time, a three-year, five-year average, very close to the $500 million that you're marking that business. Tom Fanning : Yes. So I mean, let me just say it another way. Were we to spend the dollars that we allocate in our minds to Southern Power, that's an additional $2.5 billion to the CapEx forecast that doesn't show up in the forecast. Michael Weinstein : Yes. That's right. I hear where you're heading. Tom Fanning : Yes. And like I said before, there's probably an additional $1 billion. I mean, who knows on transmission. And then whatever happens on fleet transition, there's something else there. Yes. I think what we've given you is kind of a bare bones approach, which we think is appropriate. And then that supports the 5% to 7%. Drew Evans : And what we've represented for Southern Power in particular at $1.3 billion are committed projects that we will execute on within this calendar year or represents maintenance of those facilities over time. Michael Weinstein : Now I mean, you mentioned that the increase or the extension of tax credits and the promotion of renewable power by the Biden administration going forward could present more opportunities for Southern Power. In the past, you've been a little more, I guess, more cautious on it, saying that returns have been tight. You've been pulling back on spending at Southern Power. Are we \u2013 are you reversing that stance now? Are you thinking of it may be more opportunity, not less going forward? Tom Fanning : No. In fact, I thought I'd put those words in there. The returns have been \u2013 the terms and conditions have been tougher. The duration of the contract has been shorter. And so all I'm saying is, and that's really the reason why we don't include capital commitment to Southern Power in our forecast, we think it's a very tough market. Now I was only postulating that with an administration that is really bullish on pushing more renewables, that the markets may get a little looser. But they're certainly not now. Michael Weinstein : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello, Angie. How are you? Angie Storozynski : Great. How are you guys. So I have a question, one, obviously, about Vogtle. So we're all waiting to have functional testing to start. We have some concerns if it's going to uncover any sort of catastrophic flaw of the project. I mean is there anything you guys have learned about Unit 3 that would make you feel more comfortable with how hot functional testing is going to go? Tom Fanning : Yes. Angie, knock on wood, and don't show overconfidence or what have you. The Chinese plants that went through hot functional test went through it pretty well without any incident. We have every reason to believe that will be our experience as well. I just can't predict the future. That's all. There\u2019s nothing that I know of that will cause me concern right now. And hey \u2013 and Angie, the other thing is we've done all these partial system tests along the way. And I think we've even surprised ourselves how well those have gone. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And something completely unrelated. Given what's been happening in Texas, and I understand it's a completely different design of market, but we're about to have this debate about what types of plants are needed on the system in order to maintain a reliable electric service. And again, lots of differences between your service territory and ERCOT. But in light of what has happened, is it changing your perspective of what types of power plants your utilities should have? You talked about some generation replacement. How does, again, the last week play into this planning? Tom Fanning : Yeah. Let me offer up a few comments. I was on CNBC this morning, and it was a great topic of interest and discussion about what about Texas. And it really gets into this idea of organized markets versus integrated regulated markets. You know I've been a fan of integrated regulated markets. Through our integrated resource plans, we can effectively begin with optimal capacity portfolios and iterate around transmission that supports those optimal portfolios. We can also build in resilience requirements and socialize those costs over a large customer base. And we've been able to do that for a decade, and it has worked exceedingly well. A real criticism of the so-called organized markets is that they are set up -- and I think the people inside those markets operate quite rationally, but they either operate within punitive constraints or profit incentives that are broadly -- and every market is different, as you know, but they're broadly designed around maximizing short run marginal properties. So minimizing short run marginal cost, that's no way to build a portfolio. And I would argue that the outcome of those designs is, as you start to include other value attributes like transmission, like -- I'm sorry, not transition, like a backup generation, like resiliency, like other things, you get to really complex approaches in a market. I think PJM has been wrestling with how to value all those things. I guess, the second thing is that you really don't get a sense of valuing long-term base-load capacity as it should be. And I think we've seen that in the markets where, for heaven's sakes, very valuable nuclear generation is getting priced out of the market. And those valuable assets, especially as we consider a carbon reduced future are getting priced out of the market and getting turned down. I think there\u2019s better approaches here. And so it was interesting. Not only did I have this conversation on CNBC this morning, and I guess I'll just be a little obtrusive about this, but I was called by the Biden administration. From a national security standpoint, what can we do as an industry to avoid these things? Unfortunately, given the market structure of ERCOT, there's probably not a lot we can do in the near term. But I think long-term, this notion of resilience versus reliability, reliability is how we handle the vagaries of weather and economic load and machine reliability under known conditions. Resilience is the idea of keeping your system up under unknown and unexpected conditions. Whether they be operational, weather-driven or cyber related, these are things we must do as an industry. And I think Southern is in a good position to help lead that dialogue. Angie Storozynski : Awesome. Thank you. Tom Fanning : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello Andrew. Thanks for joining us. Andrew Weisel : Hi. Good afternoon. Question -- you talked quite a bit about the updating the decarbonization strategy. I guess my question more specifically to Georgia is given the political changes, it's now a pretty solid blue state that Saturday Night Live made a funny sketch about. Does that change your thinking at all about how the pace and the method at which you plan to reduce your carbon footprint in Georgia coming into the IRP? Tom Fanning : We don't try to evaluate long-term strategies based on the current politics of any state or elected official or what have you. We have, I think, a very solid long-term plan. Now, I think the broader kind of issue that we'll be dealing with is how fast do we want to get to net zero and how will we do that. How will we evaluate the relative merits of just trading out one form of generation for another. How will we help fund and push some long research and development, energy innovation as solutions that will make this transition, hopefully, easier and more efficient in the years ahead? CNBC also did a segment just before mine with Bill Gates. He and I are on the American Energy Innovation Council, and we're working on several ideas. Whether they are storage-based, hydrogen-based fourth generation, nuclear-based or even energy efficiency-based, letting energy innovation work for us and maybe joining into a reimagined partnership with government to make that happen is, I think, a very wise energy policy to follow. And like I say, we're already engaged with the Biden administration on some of those concepts, and I look forward to their ideas as they advance. Andrew Weisel : Okay. I guess, maybe a different way to ask a similar question is you're very \u2013 you're ahead of schedule as far as your interim carbon emission reduction goal for 2030. Do you see opportunity to accelerate the net zero target from 2050 currently? Tom Fanning : Sure. I think it really is a matter, though, of working with our local jurisdictions in each of the states. To do that in a wise manner. So we'll be doing that. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. And one unrelated question. On dividends, the growth has obviously been fairly modest at $0.08 or about 3% per year. I recognize the high current payout ratio, but you talked about the Vogtle penalties going away in 12 and 24 months and then the 5% to 7% earnings growth thereafter. What's your current thinking on the outlook for dividend growth once we're past the Vogtle construction? Tom Fanning : So of course, that's a decision of the Board, and we'll make obviously recommendations to the Board. But you guys can do the math as well as we do. And I'm looking at my friend, Drew Evans, right now and kind of laughing. I have a certain half-life with my career here. Certainly, as we grow into this long-term earnings guidance that we've put before you, one of the choices that I think the people that follow me will be able to make very easily will be whether to take the dividend payout ratio down perhaps below 70% or whether to increase the rate of growth of dividends per share. That is certainly a strategic option on the table. But we'll carry that with the Board at the right time. Drew Evans : Yes. No, I'd just say, Andrew, we've been incredibly protective of our creditworthiness. We're very focused on ratings and conversations with the rating agencies related to Vogtle construction in particular. And we think it's most prudent to hold dividend growth at a modest level until we come out from under the large-scale construction that we're performing down in Augusta. Once we get through Vogtle and headline risk is behind us and our credit metrics start to strengthen in the categories we think are more at home with how we've operated in the past, we'll start to take a look at what dividend policy would be. And we'll also really start to hone in on what our target credit rating might be. Southern has operated at a -- as a premium to its peer group relatively in PE in periods where we didn't post headline risk. And in periods where our credit was a little bit stronger than where we stand today, and so all these things are going to be considerations as we go forward. Tom Fanning : And consistent with what Drew just said, we typically say it on every call, we didn't say it yet, one of the other outcomes of this reset and moving to these higher rates, not just earnings per share growth improvement, cash flow improvement is pretty significant, over $800 million in increased cash flow per year. Drew Evans : That\u2019s right. Andrew Weisel : Terrific. Thank you very much. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir. Tom Fanning : Hi, Jeremy. How are you? Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good. Thanks for having me. Good afternoon. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to reach out to the 2024 guidance as you laid out there. And thinking about Georgia, the Georgia Power ROE and recovery of Vogtle overspend. If you could paint any kind of broad strokes on what assumptions might be baked in on those two items into your guidance there? Tom Fanning : We're always, I think, reasonably cautious and relatively conservative on our guidance. The only thing I would just say is that for the system, it is a reasonable estimate of what we expect to earn across the system. We're not pushing numbers in order to hit those ranges. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on 2021 itself guidance there implies, kind of, a smaller step up year-over-year. Are there any meaningful drivers to this outside of Vogtle ROE penalty? Drew Evans : No. I would say that the Vogtle ROE penalty is the single largest driver that depresses earnings in 2021, almost $0.24 a share related to our constructions there, very consistent with an agreement that was reached with the commission a couple of years ago. Jeremy Tonet : Very helpful. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Tom Fanning : You bet. Drew Evans : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we now have a question from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hi, Michael. How are you? Michael Lapides : I\u2019m well. Thank you for taking my question. There's been some interesting dynamics at the FERC with some of the utilities having made filings regarding having the FERC review potentially a grid operator like structure in the Southeast. Can you just give your views on where you think that's going? What do you think the point is? What do you think the consensus is? You talked a little bit about the difference between regulated markets and the merchant power markets. And it just made me think of having seen a little bit of those filings and trying to understand where the long-term goal is. Tom Fanning : The long-term goal is for us to not break what's working. And so when you look at these markets down here, we've been able to provide for clean, safe, reliable power for decades for our customers' benefit. And the data just overwhelmingly supports that. When you look at the so-called organized markets, I think there's a certain amount of chaos in those markets where I think, originally, people with great goodwill thought they would reap great benefits. I don't think the risk return that we see in those markets benefits customers at all. You know recently, we've submitted, we think, even an improvement to our own wholesale markets. That is the same effort, which, frankly, is a model that allows us to benefit renewables, particularly solar in a more efficient way, and it broadens the market to bring in people like Duke and TVA and others. And so we've broadened the market. I think we've made it more attractive to renewables because we believe that renewables are going to be really important as we transition the fleet. We'll continue to seek ways to improve our markets over time, but they're working well. I can't believe anybody would find the wisdom to throw that out right now. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciate it. Tom Fanning : Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from the line Paul Fremont with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello, Paul. Great to hear from you. Paul Fremont : Great talking with you. My first question is a pretty technical question. For Southern Power, are the targeted investments inclusive of tax equity, or are the \u2013 or does that represent your share of what you are planning on spending? Drew Evans : I would say that today, this represents our share. But as we evaluate all of these projects and as they go into commercial operation, we've looked at a number of alternatives or ways to optimize the returns that we receive there. This 1.3 actually represents all capital being deployed at Southern Power. Tom Fanning : And I think the big chunk of that is a wind deal. There is a little bit of a storage deal. The wind deal, we kind of like. It's got the 10-year profile. Where we did a lot of the tax equity, I guess, was on the solar. We had the big pop in one year, and we didn't particularly like the impact of all that in our financials. Drew Evans : So Southern Power is an animal [ph]. I would say that rather than us trying to define an amount of capital that we're interested in deploying there, projects tend to draw capital from the parent when they can meet certain criteria. Many of the things that we found over the last couple of years have been largely in the solar \u2013 I'm sorry, in the wind arena because we're able to find better contract terms, better contract counterparties, and construction risk is generally handled by others. And we've been pretty fortunate, I think, the last couple of years this particular plan includes a couple of identified wind transactions. And as Tom said, two battery transactions in the California marketplace where we're building attendant to our own solar, and that will give us a tremendous amount of experience in attaching storage to solar that we'll look at deploy across the balance of fleet and in other locations. Paul Fremont : Great. And then my second question, if I go back to staff testimony, I think what they were suggesting back in the fall was that you guys were hoping to get all of your ITAAC \u2013 remaining ITAAC approvals done by March, which would have been like over 240. But now when we get to mid-March, which is the start date of your hot functional testing, they'll still be about 200 that you need to get in hand based on the numbers that you provided today. Tom Fanning : That's right. Paul Fremont : What gets you to, sort of, accelerate the level of ITAAC approvals to such a high extent to allow you to load the fuel in July? Tom Fanning : You bet. And thank you for -- Paul, for shining light on that important issue. We believe that the ultimate filing of ITAACs, we've accomplished a lot with the NRC, frankly, over the life of this project, and we've shrunk down, what was it, about 875 or something down to about 4.25 or somewhere. And we've adopted the practice of the UIN. That is we filed the form and substance of an ITAAC and have that approved. So really, all we have to do now is essentially fill in the blanks as to the result of a test. As a result, by working with the NRC in this constructive way, I think once we get the systems in place to submit the results in the ITAAC, I think the ITAAC process is going to go really well. Like I say, the NRC has been great in this regard. And recall, we got NRC personnel all over the plant, working with us to make sure all this happen. Paul, the issue was not ITAACs. The issue is getting the systems done, getting the turnover appropriate with the testing appropriate and, the paper, as we pointed out before, appropriate, so that we can file in -- put in the values in these ITAACs and submit them. So I said this, I think, on the last call, and I made a big deal about it, when I say paper, it almost feels too glib. This idea of having engineers present, this would be back to our own, the NRC, that will evaluate the as built condition of the plant and harmonizing that to the design basis of the plant and making sure it exactly meets our standards, is really taking a lot of time, and it is a complex exercise. The most important thing we can do is assure that we have quality. That will permit the ITAAC process to go well. Frankly, it will permit the testing processes that we will do now HFT to go well. So the filing of ITAAC is simply associated with system turnover of these important processes within the plant. Operator : Mr. Fremont, do you have any further questions? Paul Fremont : No, thank you. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you sir. And now we have a question from the line of Andrew Levi with HITE Hedge. Please go ahead sir. Tom Fanning : Andrew, how you're doing? Andrew Levi : I\u2019m all right. I think most of my questions were answered. I was taken as listening this call, you'll probably get Vogtle before you're seeing offshore wind gets done. What do you think? I think -- bidding on that. It's funny how things happen. So seriously, though, I think I understand everything that you're saying as far as the potential renewable spend and the transmission and possibly distribution around that. Just on -- as far as the time line, so I guess at some point this year, hopefully soother rather than later, we hear from the Biden administration on what their plan is as far as their energy plan. And then probably, I guess, November, hopefully, knock on wood, Vogtle 3 goes into operation. At that point, I guess, is that when you'll kind of have a better idea of how much incremental CapEx is going to be? And I guess, kind of just kind of doing back-of-the-envelope and some conversations I had with you guys, I'm thinking it probably could add 200 basis points to the electric utility rate base growth longer term from the 4% to the 6%. Again, I don't want to put numbers out there that you're not comfortable talking about, but that's kind of like a time line and thinking that I have as far as finding out and will remain that \u2013 going with all this. Tom Fanning : Well, I'll tell you my friend, here's let me give you a couple of ways to think about it. Number one, the key is going to be these IRPs that \u2013 where we do this integrated resource planning, no kidding. And so as we submit those and have those approved ultimately with each of our states, we have a very good idea as to how the CapEx forecast will change, whether fleet transition occurs, to what degree, what about transmission, the whole pit, that will be very illuminating. In advance of those important regulatory processes, we already have an ELG kind of requirement put out for our coal unit. And so some of those units are already on the thin economic margin as you add new requirements to them. I think that may cause us to accelerate that conversation with our commissions. But rest assured, you guys -- you know us exceedingly well. I think you and I were laughing with each other not long ago. I think you and I go back maybe 30 years in talking about our dogma in dealing with state regulation. We will not get in front of the regulators and the regulatory processes with you or anyone else. We're going to let those things play out, and then we'll reflect that in our plan but as it shows up. Drew Evans : Yes. And Andy, I would just add that this is a complex topic, and I'll just start by saying ELG limitation guidelines, I'd like to use an acronym on the call, which will regulate sort of mercury and slim and a couple of other things that come out of our facilities, we'll have to make some choices about how we \u2013 whether or not we control those facilities, put them into limited use or ultimately retire those facilities. The one thing that is certain is that if you look at the technology that's available to us today, it's not a simple substitution of what we currently generate with to what the future might look like. There are certain changes in material science that need to occur. There are certain complexities related to clean, safe and reliable power that have to be met. There are transmission considerations that have to be taken into account. And \u2013 but if you wanted to put a big, broad bow to wrap around it, if we have to do 10 gigawatts, and let's say that 7 of that is replacement or that 3 needs to be held in reserve for some period of time, you could think about numerically what the replacement of something like that amount of generation would require and make the assumption that we probably have to do 15% or 20% of that total CapEx in addition in transmission distribution. So there are ways to kind of come around \u2013 come to what's the size of this, ultimately, I think, for the company. Tom Fanning : And so let me give you a head start like what do you want to say. I would argue you have kind of this. I'm giving you caveman math now. So looking at that forecast, I'll bet you, I kind of gave a few numbers already. If you were to fill out our $0.5 billion per year, there's $2.5 billion, add another $1 billion for transmission. And then on top of that, put in some estimate, probably backend loaded on generation replacement. And it's easy to see that I think you could get to don't hold me to this, and we're not forecasting it flat. But added to the CapEx forecast, $5 billion to $8 billion over this time frame. I don't think that's unreasonable. And you can do the math on what that does to your growth rates. That's easy. Andrew Levi : Okay, okay. Yeah I can add, subtract, multiply and divide. Tom Fanning : No, you're a genius. I love this. Andrew Levi : Thank you. Thank you very much guys. Tom Fanning : Oh, you're the best. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And now we have a question from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed sir. Tom Fanning : Hi, Paul thanks for being with us. Paul Patterson : Hi. Good to be here. So just on the COVID impact on Vogtle, it looks like you guys have taken into account not just your current experience but what you expect in the future. And I see what you guys give us good data on how infection rates have been trending. I'm just wondering, what is your expectation going forward about the impact of COVID on construction of Vogtle? And I apologize if I missed this, but are your people getting vaccinated? Are there essential workers that -- it varies from state to state it seems. So I was just wondering -- I was just wondering sort of what -- if you can just elaborate? Tom Fanning : Yeah. Sure, you bet. So I help lead the ESCC, Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, for this industry. It started with cyber and went to physical national security matters. It has grown into storm response and now COVID. We have had lots of good dialogue with HHS and a variety of other people about the right classification for utility workers. And you got to be proud of this industry through this crazy hurricane season we had last year, we were able to adopt cutting-edge COVID protocols and get the lights back on, the wires up and the plants running again. So we've done a good job. I would argue that these guys, particularly the people that work hard to keep the lights on, and our hearts go out to them and thank them for their hard work this year. They should be treated as critical resources for this nation and, therefore, get a very high priority to receive vaccination. It is, though, at the end of the day, despite what the CDC will recommend, it is the option of each state to deploy those vaccines. Now we've got great relations in each state, particularly in Georgia, where Vogtle is, there's been a lot of discussion. And I have to make sure that the folks that can get the vaccines are -- it's available to the folks at the site. I'm going to guess that they may be able to get vaccines maybe within a month or so, but that's highly uncertain and depends upon the ultimate deployment within the state. Paul Patterson : Okay. Okay. And then just on COVID-19. I'm just as you know, there have been some papers and stuff out there indicating that perhaps the long-term economic impact could be pretty substantial. When you talk about your plans and just talk about utilities in general, one doesn't really tend to think that that -- your growth or whatever would be impacted by that or that whether there have to be some big deviation if, in fact, the economy does change as a result of COVID-19, or what have you. Is that pretty much -- is that just roughly speaking, sort of, the way to think about this? Tom Fanning : Paul, let's Drew and I tank this one. Let me go first and I'll shut up and let you go. But here's what I see. From my past \u2013 to the Fed, I'd love to break the industrial segment, particularly as a great leading indicator into 10 big segments for Southern. And then not only do I look at period-versus-period results. Virtually all of it is still negative compared to a year ago, obviously, pre COVID. But the momentum statistics are really illuminating now, and they have turned positive. So of the 10 segments that make up something like 80% of our industrial sales, eight of them from a momentum standpoint are turning positive. So that tells me, and with a quote that has been put out there by me in the past, America is learning to live with COVID. A, I think COVID incidences are starting to decline. Maybe that's the normal sign wave we see from any surge, which we just went through. And maybe it's the longer-term effect of getting more people vaccinated. Didn't the Biden administration say recently, they want everybody vaccinated by July or sometime this summer? So surely, that will have an impact. But the economic data I see would show a recovery, I don't know, down 3% last year, maybe up 2% to 3% this year, with industrial starting to respond in a favorable manner. Drew Evans : Yes. I always worry about the long-term implications of something like this because the pressure that we put on folks on the margin or the COVID puts on folks on the margin will reveal itself. We've been served 60 days away from COVID ending for now 10 months. And so it'll be interesting to see where we come out. Our expectation around how it would impact our particular customers actually was quite different than what we expected on the onset. So we expected that retail customer usage would increase as people stayed home. We actually expected industrial production would maintain itself \u2013 would decline a little bit but not quite as drastically as it has and that commercial customers would be impacted most acutely, and it was very \u2013 it was a very different outcome. Commercial customers found a way to do business in a different way, not all, but most. And industrial went through a period where there was sort of a reduction in output as because inventories were at a reasonable level and they could sort of pare down that inventory as they saw the economy progress. We've now seen sort of a tightening in supply in a number of the industrial segments, and production has started to pick up. And there have always been two or three standout weak segments in any particular two or three month period. But as Tom said today, the momentum is generally positive, and we're encouraged by the fact that people have adapted their businesses to earn profits in a way that they maybe hadn't anticipated two years ago. But yes. I or \u2013 a year ago, I always worry that the longer anything goes, the more pressure you're going to put on somebody on the margin for sure. Tom Fanning : In quick punchy stats, non-pharma employment fell nationally 6.2%. In the southeast, it was only 1.7%. Last year, in our territory, we had record job creation, best we've ever done. We're seeing an increase. I want to say the increase in jobs projected in our economic development group that we're showing that's kind of our headlights, up 17%. And then you see events like Microsoft coming in developing Atlanta as their third hub. There are other hubs being, of course, Seattle and San Francisco or Silicon Valley. Look, I'm not going to paint a super rosy picture, but I will say the southeast is really resilient. What's down right now? Chemicals are down mostly. We see that is driven by a large outage in particularly one plant in Alabama. Drew Evans : And some global demand for chemical, which might change the marginal economics of a single facility for sure. Tom Fanning : And what kind of looks bright, it looks like pipeline, especially as we start seeing gas continue to displace coal, the pipes are doing pretty well. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Well, thank you. These are exciting times, and I know the folks around our system that made the system perform as well as they did in 2020, just a great debt of gratitude. And I want to commend specifically our recovered workers, particularly IBEW and the folks from the broad building trades all around the system, particularly at Plant Vogtle 3 and 4, the leadership of the IBEW, the leadership of the building trades, they are terrific business partners for us, and we could not have achieved this level of success without their great leadership and the great work of the folks that are members there. I really like the cards we have. I like the fact that we have a lot of optionality no matter what the future holds. And I think we've run this business over the past decade to leave it stronger than ever. We'll get through Vogtle 3 and look forward to the progress there. We'll get through Vogtle 4 next year, and we're off and running. Thanks, everybody, for your attention today, and we'll talk to you soon. That's all. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Thank you all once again. Have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded Thursday, April 29, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please, go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Dimitra. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported a strong start to the year with adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2021 ahead of our estimate. The economies in our service territories are starting to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the customer demand remains mildly lower than pre-pandemic levels during the first quarter, it exceeded our expectation. Importantly, many of the programs we implemented to keep customers connected during the pandemic have proven to be very effective. We have reliably provided energy to our customers and facilitated alternative payment arrangements for those in need. I continue to be proud of our employees and the ways we have partnered with our communities throughout this pandemic. This past February parts of our nation were contending with the effects of devastating winter weather that crippled generating units and power grids in Texas and beyond. At Southern Company, each of our businesses, including those with operations in Texas and the Southwest region performed well during this event. Our regulated electric and gas utilities did not experience any operational issues or related service disruptions. Southern Power was minimally impacted due to its highly contracted business model. Our wholesale gas services subsidiary Sequent Energy effectively served customers in need utilizing in large part, natural gas held in storage. And micro grids provided by power secure had a 98 runtime reliability producing over 2,260 megawatt hours of reliable energy for customers during the storm. The winter seasons atypical temperatures have also caused utilities across the country to evaluate their own system resilience under similar conditions. For Southern Company are vertically integrated structure and integrated resource planning process as we utilize across our Southeast electric utilities have beneficial for years in allowing us along with our regulators to carefully consider, plan for, and invest in infrastructure needed to address a range of extreme circumstances and improve resilience. We will continue to leverage the rigorous analysis and stakeholder input provided by these proceedings as we evaluate the potential for additional system enhancements across our footprint. Let\u2019s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing started on April 25 marking the last milestone in a series of major tests. Hot Functional Testing is conducted to verify the successful operation of reactor components and systems together and to confirm that the reactor is ready for fuel load. As part of the testing, the site team will run Unit 3 plant systems without nuclear fuel and advanced through the testing process to reach normal operating pressure and temperature. Starting Hot Functional Testing represents a significant step towards the operation of Unit 3 and ultimately providing customers with a reliable carbon-free energy source for the next 60 years to 80 years. The site work plan now targets fuel load in the third quarter and late December, 2021 in-service date for Unit 3, of course, any delays could result in a first quarter 2022 Unit 3 in-service date. Now, as we have stated in prior calls and important step in the system turnover process is to assure that the as built state of the plant aligns with the design basis and to resolve any differences. Before we close systems, declare them ready for testing and submit ITAAC. We are committed to the notion of getting it right. In recent months, Southern Nuclear identified certain construction remediation work, primarily electrical in nature that was necessary to ensure the quality and design standards were met prior to the start of Hot Functional Testing. We reviewed the project construction quality programs prior to Hot Functional Testing, we implemented improvement plans and we believe Southern Nuclear\u2019s construction quality program is effective. Furthermore, the improvement plans we are implementing are designed to help drive successful completion of Unit 3 and improve performance for Unit 4. As the operator of these units, we are committed to getting it right, striving to ensure our safety and quality standards are met prior to significant testing and operations activities. We will not sacrifice that commitment to meet schedule or milestone dates. With Unit 3 direct construction nearing completion, and Hot Functional Testing in progress, our primary system focus include going forward one, successful completion of Hot Functional Testing, two, completion of the remaining construction system turnovers and testing leading to fuel load, and three, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient start-up of the unit. The ITAAC submittal and review process is expected to accelerate as we move into and beyond the hot functional test sequence. To date 188 ITAAC had been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 211 during Hot Functional Testing as we approach fuel load. Turning the Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 80% complete. And the current site work plan targets completion in the third quarter of 2022, which would provide margin to the regulatory approve November 22 in service date. Earlier this week, the site came placed the water tank on top of the Unit 4 containment vessel and shield building roof representing the last major crane lift at the project site. Integrated flush is in progress and initial energization is expected in the coming weeks. The site is focused on increasing craft, labor resources and electrical productivity. We will continue adding incremental resources while also shifting resources from Unit 3 to Unit 4, which is expected to increase our current pace of construction completion. Construction completion has averaged 1.5% per month since the start of the year. In order to achieve November 22 regulatory and approved and service date, we estimate we would need to average construction completion of approximately 2% per month through the end of this year. And as a reference point, Unit 3 averaged approximately 2% during the second half of 2019 and through the first half of 2020, which did include periods heavily impacted by COVID-19. Looking now at cost during the first quarter Georgia Power allocated $84 million of contingency into the base capital forecast related to extending the schedule for Unit 3, performing construction remediation work and increasing support resources across both units. As a result, Georgia Power replenished its contingency by $48 million reporting an after-tax charge of $36 million at the end of the first quarter. While there was contingency remaining prior to this increase, we believe providing this additional amount of contingency is appropriate when considering the extended time necessary to reach the start of Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing and the potential cost risk remaining as we complete both units. The major risks that remain to our cost estimate are similar to those for schedule namely, one, our ability to increase earned hours and improve productivity or CPI at Unit 4, successful completion of the Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing, and three, completion of the system turnovers and subsequent testing lead it to the Unit 3 fuel load. Notably at this time last year, the onset of COVID-19 led to many uncertainties at the project site. The site team has responded in exemplary fashion, maintaining safety and progress toward completion of both units during what has been an unprecedented year. With effective COVID protocols in place and now the broader availability of vaccines, the impact on the site has decreased in recent months as active cases and isolation rates are trending significantly lower. We are very pleased that Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing is underway. We\u2019ve consistently said that both the commencement and successful completion of this testing sequence will reduce risk for the project. And as always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important project. Drew, I\u2019ll turn it over to you now for an update on the financial. Drew Evans : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. I hope you\u2019re all safe and well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.98, $0.20 higher than last year and $0.14 above our estimate. The primary drivers compared to last year was strong performance at our state-regulated utilities, despite a comparative quarter that had very limited COVID-19 impacts. The lessons we learned during COVID-19 allowed us to maintain a relatively static cost structure as we saw a withdrawal of COVID-19 impacts from their peak. We saw year-over-year benefit of $0.06 from weather due to the extremely mild first quarter we experienced in 2020. Further, retail electric revenues increased in aggregate due to strong customer growth in the Southeast and constructive state regulatory actions. When looking at an adjusted EPS as compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers of the positive variance were continued expense discipline, retail sales impacts from COVID-19 that were nearly 60% better than our forecast across all customer classes and significantly lower than their peak and residential customer growth that has continued to exceed our expectation by almost 50%, we added nearly 60,000 customers last year. A detailed reconciliation of our report and adjusted quarterly results as compared to 2020 is included in today\u2019s release and the earnings package. Looking more closely at sales in the first quarter, weather-normal retail sales were only approximately 1.5% lower than last year\u2019s largely unaffected quarter. This decrease was driven by the continued trends of higher residential sales offset by lower commercial and industrial sales compared to normal times. While residential sales remained elevated, commercial and industrial sales continue to be depressed by about 3%. As you would expect, the commercial sub-sectors most impacted by the pandemic continue to be office, restaurant and education. These are meaningful declines and we expect recovery to be very gradual, even with improving economic conditions. For industrial sales during the quarter, supply chain constraints appear to be affecting the automotive sector with primary metals and chemicals also down, but construction and lumber in particular are demonstrating early strength. In general, all industrial segments have moved stronger since the COVID-19 peak. The economies in our service territory are showing strong signs of recovery with retail sales exceeding our expectations in the first quarter by roughly 3 percentage points. A recent analysis produced by IHS Markit estimates that most Southeastern states, including Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi are predicted to return to their pre-pandemic peak employment levels by 2022, while other states may not return to these levels until 2025 and beyond. We have certainly learned that the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts are unpredictable, but the potential for more near-term recovery is encouraging. We mentioned on our last call that economic development trends are strong in our region, particularly in Georgia. And in fact, in the first quarter of 2021 alone, economic development announcements in Southern Company\u2019s retail electric service territory, included the addition of over 3,600 new jobs and investments of more than $2.2 billion. We saw strong activity in both non-manufacturing and manufacturing segments with new project announcements across a variety of industries, including warehousing, distribution, scientific and transportation equipment among others. For the second quarter of 2021, our estimated EPS \u2013 our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.78. I would also like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, the Southern Company board of directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.64 per share. This action marks our 20th consecutive annual increase and for 73 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. The Board\u2019s decision to increase the dividend reinforces the strength and sustainability of Southern Company\u2019s business. This dedication to continuing our dividend increases combined with our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%, supports our objective of providing superior risk adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long-term. Before I turn the call back to Tom, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes providing an update on some of our strategic priorities. On our ESG efforts, recall in January, Southern Company became the first major U.S. utility to publish a sustainable financing framework. Our first issuance was a green bond related to Southern Power\u2019s renewable investments, further solidifying Southern Power is one of the largest green bond issuers in the United States. In February, we issued our inaugural sustainable bond at Georgia Power with net proceeds to be used for sustainable projects, such as our spending with diverse and small business suppliers and our investment in renewable energy projects. The Georgia Power issuance aligns with our ongoing commitments to the community and the continued growth of Georgia Power solar portfolio. We look forward to leveraging our sustainable financing framework for future financings by all of our issuers as appropriate. Also I\u2019d mentioned that Southern Power has been very active over the last few years, establishing itself as one of the nation\u2019s largest renewable generation owners with a total renewable portfolio of nearly 5,000 megawatts in operation are under construction. Within the last month, Southern Power announced the acquisition of the 300-megawatt Deuel Harvest wind facility located in South Dakota and the 118-megawatt Glass Sands wind facility located in Oklahoma. With these acquisitions, Southern Power now owns 15 wind projects and approximately 2,500 megawatts of solar across the U.S. along with approximately 160 megawatts of battery storage. The existing generation fleet comprised of both renewables and natural gas is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Finally, over the past three years, we have strategically simplified our business in order to focus our time and investments in our core operations. As another example of that commitment, yesterday, we entered into an agreement to sell our wholesale gas trading and services business comprised of Sequent Energy Management and Sequent Energy Canada and we expect to complete the transaction in the third quarter of 2021. We do not expect a material gain or loss on the sale of the business, there we\u2019ll provide a return of the associated working capital and the elimination of certain credit supports of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, we have always excluded Sequent\u2019s earnings from our adjusted results due to its quarterly variability. So the sale of this business both reduces risk and has no impact on our adjusted EPS expectations for the remainder of the year. I\u2019d like to personally thank the team at Sequent for their years of dedication and service to the company. I can tell you that it\u2019s been my pleasure working with all of those individuals at Sequent for more than 20 years. And I really look forward to their continued success. Tom, with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Drew. As I noted last quarter, we achieved a 50% reduction in GHG emissions in 2020, beating our 2030 goal by a decade. Earlier this month, we filed an integrated resource plan in Mississippi that includes the retirement of Mississippi\u2019s last coal unit in 2027. Both Alabama Power and Georgia Power will work with their respective regulators over the next year and responding to the effluent limitation guideline rules, which they will reflect in their next integrated resource plan. We will also continue to work with all stakeholders in developing these strategies. Another note, we have historically worked in partnership with municipalities and co-ops in our region. We work hard on mutual respect and constructive collaboration. As an example of the wisdom of this approach, Alabama Power recently signed a long-term agreement with Power South of valued customer in Alabama, which is expected to create energy savings and enhance system reliability from coordinated planning and operations. As a part of this agreement, Alabama Power has the right to participate in a portion of power SaaS future incremental load growth. In closing, our strong first quarter positions us well to deliver on the financial objectives for the year, with the summer months and storm season ahead, our operating companies are well prepared to support the needs of our customers. And of course, all eyes remain on progress at Vogtle and we look forward to providing continued updates as we approach fuel load and in service for Unit 3. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we\u2019re now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed. Tom Fanning : Julien, how are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good afternoon team. Hey, good to chat. Absolutely. So if I can \u2013 if we can chat here, you pointed out several factors that contributed to the progress of the project, right. But clearly, productivity is your focus area, it seems like from your prepared comments here. Can you talk about your plans there to turn around productivity? It sounds like it\u2019s more so Unit 4 and Unit 3, but just all together, where do we stand more specifically numerically on productivity, we\u2019re in the effective of \u2013 and what do you think you can do to improve that specifically? Tom Fanning : You bet. Yes. Well, look, number one, we\u2019re basically modeling forward experience on three for four. So let\u2019s think about it. Do you remember last year? It really started about the last six months of 2019 through the first six months of 2020. Remembering when we were staffing up, effectively that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now on four. We\u2019ve delayed that and we\u2019ve accounted for all this and revised estimate to complete and everything else. Because we didn\u2019t want to release all these people to four until effectively, we finished three. So what we have done is just estimated that we can hit November with experienced similar to last year. We\u2019ll get CPI up to, I don\u2019t know, about 165 for the remainder of the project. We\u2019ll be completing at least 2%. Now here\u2019s where I think we have room for improvement. Remember, the period I just told you last six months of 2019, first six months of 2020. Included in that, we\u2019re three waves of COVID, who knows what\u2019s going to happen with COVID. But we have some reason for optimism given that we\u2019ve expanded vaccines. It appears that the way they\u2019ve gotten smaller, certainly our experience right now, it is way less than it has been. And so our view is productivity should rise. And so we have some level of optimism, obviously we can guarantee it that we\u2019ll at least meet or beat what we did on Unit 3 with Unit 4, one last thing. There are always lessons learned on Unit 3 and some of the quality measures we just talked about going into hot functional tests. We\u2019re applying all of those lessons to Unit 4 so that we won\u2019t have to repeat them there. In fact, our good friends from Vogtle came to our last board meeting and reiterated the notion that we should see better performance on 4 than 3. All we\u2019re saying is right now, Julien, that even if we did just what we did on Unit 3, we can hit November. We frankly believe and expect will do better. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But we won\u2019t see that uptick and replacing personnel until after fuel load. Tom Fanning : I would say \u2013 so let\u2019s go through the big risk factors going forward on three. I guess the predicate is you\u2019ve got to have a successful HFT, right. I think the biggest risk factor, however, going forward is after HFT to fuel load, there\u2019s two segments of work left that we still have to do and do well. One is, completing the work that really is related to nuclear fuel, right. HFT means that we\u2019re going to use the effluent heat off the reactor coolant pumps to heat up the project. So it would be things related to nuclear fuel, like, the system\u2019s required to remove the fuel from the fuel pool and move it over to the reactor core. It would include systems like finishing up the Radwaste facility. The second segment would relate to, what I would call broadly support systems, recall that we\u2019re going to have about 800 permanent employees at the site. So support systems for those folks. So let\u2019s think about HVAC communications, out of the water, things like that. That will support the people that are going to be working at the plant. And just to give you one more frame of reference, it\u2019s taken a lot to get to HFT something like the latest work we\u2019ve been doing, 60% of those systems are what we would call safety related. And by that you should hear complexity. The amount of work to be done in between HFT completion and fuel load is significantly less, maybe 60% of that work. And only about 10% or less of those systems are safety-related. So I will say this to you. I believe that\u2019s the next riskiest thing we have to do, but it\u2019s not as big a deal as it has been getting to HFT. And then the third final thing is having a successful run from fuel load in service. We feel pretty confident about that. Hey, last point, so I think, Julien, you are starting to see people move now, frankly, from Unit 3 to Unit 4. Certainly, that\u2019ll get accelerated into the summer. Probably, it\u2019ll start to max out around June, and then we\u2019ll hit our numbers at Unit 4. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Got it. Excellent. Thank you so much for the details, right. Best of luck. Appreciate it. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Appreciate you joining us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey Steve, how are you? Steve Fleishman : Hey, Tom and Drew. Good afternoon. So just first on the \u2013 I guess one question on Vogtle, just the quality issues that you \u2013 quality control issues you identified on the, I guess, the release during March. I assume you feel like those have been remediated and maybe just give some color on kind of what was done to make sure you\u2019re kind of on the right track there. Tom Fanning : You bet. So let\u2019s back up for several calls. And I use this vernacular, but I always caution you it\u2019s just vernacular paper. But effectively that involved assuring that there was in the evaluation of the as-built site \u2013 as-built condition of the plan as compared to the design basis of the plant. That was harmonized. And where there were differences that we made adjustments. Some of that was work that needed to be remediated. When we saw this starting to delay beyond what we thought, recall that we were calling for last two weeks in March, kind of start of HFT. We decided to really stop and take a good look at the system. It appears that while there were some issues elsewhere in the plant, the concentration of issues really dealt with the electrical systems. And then when you think about what it takes to turn over a system. Effectively, when we saw these problems start to manifest itself, we caught it ultimately with our quality control program. And so in effect, we had to \u2013 we sat back and looked at it and said, no. Our quality control program does work. We have identified the system. We have remediated them, in order to start HFT. There are some things that we did catch that will continue to be remediated from the finish of HFT to fuel load. But we\u2019ve sketched all that out and we\u2019re pretty confident that everything that we know we\u2019re dealing with. All of this is a part of our current cost and schedule estimates. I would say to that and Bechtel would agree with this. We talked about this with our Board that for what we have found, we think we are making adjustments to Unit 4. So that we will not, we should not repeat these issues going forward. That gives us more confidence in schedule and cost. Steve Fleishman : Great. Different topic, just the Sequent transaction and sale, did you name who the buyer was and just can better understand. So effectively, are you freeing up $1 billion of effective balance sheet through the sale, even if there is not a direct payment. Is that how to think about it. Tom Fanning : Steve, it is \u2013 we have not announced the buyer because it\u2019s something that they will likely announce on their earnings call that will come in future days. It is somebody very credible and respected in this space. And so we just think we\u2019ve found a better owner for sequent than ourselves. We probably tie up something on average, like $200 million worth of working capital. So we have to provision for that within our credit facilities. And then because of the gross revenue or gross sales associated with that business in four positions, probably something like another $800 million worth of parental support. And so these things will be freed up after some transition, we don\u2019t expect the transaction to close until the beginning of the third quarter, but we\u2019ll alert you as things progress. I always want to say value is a function of risk and return. And when you look at it, we\u2019ve never included any earnings from Sequent in our return. We\u2019ve always asked them out as extraordinary items. They\u2019re just too variable and it\u2019s fascinating. I just have some quick data to show how variable we are. If you look at Sequent, even prior to when Southern made the acquisition, say from 2010 forward. They\u2019ve averaged about $40 million in net income. They had two years, one was $260 million, and one was $163 million where they really blew out earnings. Other than that, the earnings were near zero. If you exclude those big years, so over nine years, they averaged about $4 million of net income. And since we\u2019ve owned sequence, there\u2019s been one big year, the 163 in 2019, and then this year. And then otherwise the earnings were around $23 million in net income. And so if you step back and look at it, number one, we x any earnings number two, because of the balance sheet, we are freeing up $1 billion that reduces our risk profile. So net-net to corporation values, we think this is a clear winner. I think one more thing I just thought to point out, Sequent had a really good earnings year in the first quarter. Thankfully, they had gas in storage, which supported the needs of the state of Texas primarily. You remember, there were constrained gas flows. Sequent was able to step into the breach and sell a lot of gas in storage and made a lot of \u2013 made some profits off of the volume that they were able to provide. Thank goodness to Texas\u2019 customers that produce net income of around $200 million. In recognition of our commitment to communities, we took $75 million or so of that $200 million and put it into our foundation that is going to get cloud back into communities. So you\u2019ll see net income per Sequent in the first quarter of around 133 or so. So look, we had a good year. I do think that the buyer is, as Drew said, a better owner. And know I\u2019ve said that for years, a lot of M&A is all about who\u2019s the best owner of any particular asset. And I think for what we bought and what we\u2019ve sold, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to bring value to shareholders every time. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then last question is just on the renewables acquisitions and the wind. I\u2019m just curious kind of what returns are you seeing there? Because I recall there was a period of time, where you had been saying that returns didn\u2019t really look good for these transactions and then you\u2019ve been ramping them up more recently. So I assume maybe that you started to see them improve again. Could you just give some color on that? Drew Evans : Yes. We think it\u2019s really a tough business. We continue to believe that. And Steve, I\u2019ve talked about that in the dimensions of the duration of the contracts, the terms and conditions of the contracts. And so it\u2019s just been harder. There\u2019s a lot of deals out there. I would say that our share of new deals has just been lower than historical, because there\u2019s too much money chasing too many deals. We keep the same thresholds in place. And rather than comment on any specific deal. In general, what we look for is significant contract coverage. So in this case, 90% over 10 years, we look for those things and we generally get profits that are, say, ROE is plus 150 over our regulated business. That would be our general threshold rather than commenting on particular deals. But these deals that we just mentioned that drew just mentioned fit that profile. Steve Fleishman : Great. Great. Thank you. Tom Fanning : You bet. Operator : All right. Next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey Michael. How are you? Michael Weinstein : All right. Doing good. Hopefully, you\u2019re doing good too. Hey, just to follow up on that last discussion. Could you comment on your commitment to a business like power secure, also providing services out there? Is that \u2013 how is that different than sequence? What ways are you seeing more value there? Oh Tom Fanning : It\u2019s completely different. So we\u2019ve talked in fact about a Venn diagram in the past, the three circles of a Venn diagram in this case would have been Southern Power, PowerSecure and Sequent. Now let\u2019s think about that for a minute. Sequent, now let\u2019s start with PowerSecure. PowerSecure has really been focused on kind of mostly the retail side of the business, particularly commercial and industrial customers, where resilient is particularly important. And in keeping with this 100 year old model of central station, make move and sell, projects at scale. PowerSecure essentially represents the idea of miniaturizing that century old business model and putting the make move and sell premise at the customer premises. So when you think about some of our major customers who do value resilience at an exceptional level, we can put a micro grid. We are by far the largest share of micro grids in the United States through PowerSecure. We can put distributed generation there. We can put proprietary switch gear and storage. And so this has been a wonderful kind of window on the world. Add to the Venn diagram what we\u2019ve seen lately at Southern Power. Southern power grew up selling to other utilities or other co-ops or other munis and lately a great kind of a target zone for Southern Power has been companies, desiring green attributes. So general mills, general motors, carnival cruise lines, people like that that want to have renewables as part of their generation portfolio so to speak. The union of what we\u2019re seeing at Southern Power in respect of that business, that market with the market that is served primarily by PowerSecure, there\u2019s great overlap and great mutual synergy. Now we used to have Sequent as part of that Venn diagram, where we would in fact take over fuel management for some of the distributed generation at all serviced by our customers. We feel we can do that ourselves now. And selling Sequent does an impact to a significant degree, our ability to serve that need of our customers. And if we can\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll find somebody that can. So, and look at that \u2013 and one last thing I just want to leave you with, look at the data over the past few earnings calls we\u2019ve done, through hurricanes, a winter storm URI and others. Sequent, I mean, PowerSecure is able to provide reliability in excess of 98% in general terms across these very devastating storms. This idea does work, I will say. PowerSecure remain kind of a peanut to our earnings. We don\u2019t talk about PowerSecure in terms of being a contributor to earnings, even though it is earning a little bit of money. I think the bigger value we see is as an option to what maybe happening in the future. And that is because of technology, because of changing customer requirements, it gives us a window on the world that allows us not only to learn about this new market, but also to influence how it emerges and to position our franchise businesses optimally. Drew Evans : I just add, you describe it as window on the world, it\u2019s sort of antenna into what the needs of the customer basis. It really looks like people are focused on an extra nine of reliability, but the assets can be used either to meet that reliability or it can be dispatched. I think our best example most recently is that we\u2019ll do constructions at the Atlanta Airport to produce the kind of reliability that\u2019s required there. But in terms of distributed generation, I think it demonstrates that folks are not really all that interested in prime power, but more interested in the kinds of backup and assurity that you can get out of the PowerSecure product line. Tom Fanning : And the phrase I would use is distributed infrastructure, which includes beyond generation micro grid storage, it\u2019s switch gear, et cetera. I think it\u2019s a small thing, but it really helps us. Michael Weinstein : Right. More of a future look or keeping your finger on the pulse of where the technology is going. Tom Fanning : That\u2019s right. Michael Weinstein : Hey, along those lines, one more question on this subject and that\u2019s battery storage. You have in the deck a couple of big battery storage projects standalone, I believe, is that something that you see more standalone battery projects like that getting built maybe as much as we\u2019re currently seeing in our renewable projects. Is that an up and comer? Is that something with higher returns than wind and solar, something that may be replaced? Tom Fanning : I don\u2019t know about \u2013 it\u2019ll be interesting to see whether the returns are higher. I think it\u2019s an absolute requirement. We\u2019ll build a couple hundred megawatts of battery, if you include what\u2019s in the Tranquillity and Garland packages, but also what we\u2019ll be doing within the state of Georgia. We\u2019re building the two facilities we named as part of \u2013 as compliments to our existing solar facilities in California. But storage itself is probably the single biggest complication with the transition to renewables over the next couple of decades, whether it is going to be lithium-ion, which is relatively short duration if you think about how our system operates today or something more complex like compressed air energy or liquid air, liquid metal, pump hydro is probably another great example. We\u2019re going to have to find ways for long duration storage to compliment the kinds of assets that we\u2019re talking about on the renewable side. And one of the nice arrangements that we have within Alabama Power with a PowerSource is that they actually operate today a case facility that can deliver battery power for 26 hours. It\u2019s been operating for almost 20 years. These are great experiments and understandings things for us to learn. I do think that battery will be an increasing area of investment for us. We just have to figure out what technology is most pertinent for the circumstances. Drew Evans : And I\u2019ll just add, gosh, I think somebody is going to probably ask this later, so I\u2019ll just do it now. But when we think about CapEx going forward, we think about transitioning the fleet going forward, it\u2019s very clear to us that storage in some point, whether it\u2019s short duration, intermediate, seasonal, that\u2019s going to become important to support the intermittent profile of renewables. Gosh, I think to achieve net zero for us, we\u2019re going to need about a 50% penetration, mostly of solar. And so on that cold winter peak day, you\u2019re going to need a whole lot more megawatts to be able to meet those needs some storage, some CTs, some CTs with CCS, you name it. So hydrogen is important in that regard. So these are important projects too. That\u2019s helping us understand better how to meet the aspirations of this administration. And just little more land out there, so we\u2019re \u2013 supporters of the bipartisan policy center and I\u2019m a member of the net zero business alliance, we\u2019ve had a session already with some other CEOs from Tyson Foods, Occidental Petroleum, United Airlines, Weyerhaeuser and ConocoPhillips. We\u2019re meeting again Tuesday with Gina McCarthy. And so part of our whole premise here is engaging constructively with the administration, with the concept of, yes, I am. That is we\u2019re going to need the support, we\u2019re going to need the administration in the boat with us to achieve that aspiration, assuming we have a supply chain availability. So we have labor available. The big issue for us to hit these kinds of numbers is that over the next 15 years, we will triple the amount of generation we will put on the ground as compared to any other 15-year period in our corporate history. It is a big lift. Assuming we get the support, can we do it? Yes, I think so. There are lots of policy choices along the way that make this a very complex decision. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey, Angie, great to have you with us. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So I\u2019m just wondering, I look I never heard about Sequent before, I\u2019m going to be honest. I\u2019ve never heard about pivotal either. So do you guys have any other like businesses we\u2019ve never heard of that can either bring a lot of money or the purchase \u2013 or the sale price or like release some balance sheet capacity? Tom Fanning : Not really. We\u2019re working very hard to clean those things up. I mean, we do have cats and dogs around the place, but Southern investments, right. Drew Evans : Southern Holdings, I think we\u2019ve divested of a number of assets over the last couple of years, but this is \u2013 Angie, I think our focus is just reduce business complexity focus investment on the things that we think we\u2019re rewarded around. And this is just sort of evidence of it. Are there large pockets of these things? Not a lot. But equally, probably is a little bit less. Tom Fanning : The less stuff that we\u2019ve talked about in the past had been legacy stuff from mirror going way back there. We had \u2013 they had a leasing business. They didn\u2019t have the tax appetite. So that came over with us. We\u2019ve been dealing with that. Choctaw has been a part of that, we talked about that in the past. Drew Evans : Sold all the gas-fired assets outside of our general service territory, but really just trying to focus on our core infrastructure best. Angie Storozynski : But the 200 million, you mentioned that the business made in the first quarter that stays with you guys, right. So I understand that adjustments, okay, cool. And then on\u2026 Tom Fanning : Angie, wait a minute, 200 million, we put 75 of that in a charitable foundation to help communities. So it kind of net it out at 133 or so, but that was a decision we made. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then on Vogtle, and I\u2019m sorry for simplifying it this way, but I always thought about how to functional testing as the end of the construction stage of Vogtle 3. Now the past posts have functional seems to include a lot of construction and things. So is it that you guys have delayed a portion of that construction that it was still needed to be done before the fuel load, in order to \u2013 in a sense start of hot functional? You know what I\u2019m saying is just, again, it feels to me that there\u2019s still more construction to come, even though I saw hot functional the thought of it is the end of the construction cycle. Tom Fanning : Yes. We adjust the construction schedule all the time to optimize cost and schedule. We try to do that. Heck, we do it every week, to be honest with you. In 2020, we did, this goes back to 2020. We did make an adjustment to push some of the nuclear related construction. Like I mentioned, Radwaste facility, like I mentioned, the equipment necessary to move the fuel from the storage pool over to the reactor. That was moved past HFT. The systems related to support the personnel beside had kind of always been there, I think. That was the last move, but that was kind of a year ago. And, and like I say, for the amount of construction left only, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s 10% or less, we got into an argument about what\u2019s complex and safety related, but it\u2019s a smallish amount of that work that is in that vein left to do. So it was nothing that was tactically decided in my view to do anything with HFT. This is a decision we made back mostly in 2020, except that we make adjustments every week. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And so just one follow-up. So is it fair to say that what\u2019s left to be done and granted that is probably somewhat depends on what the hot functional testing and covers. But is it fair to say at this point, you think what\u2019s left to began on the construction side is something pretty straightforward. And so it shouldn\u2019t be prone to delays that we\u2019ve seen in the past. Tom Fanning : Yes. I wish, I mean, Angie, you\u2019ve lived with us for a number of years here. I mean, there\u2019s nothing that the EV every day I\u2019ve described out there as a dog fight, but it certainly is less complex than what we\u2019ve been doing to get to HFT. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hi, Jeremy. Unidentified Analyst : This is Ryan on for Jeremy. Tom Fanning : Hey, Ryan. Unidentified Analyst : Just wanted to start kind of some of what you\u2019re hearing at the federal level out of kind of the infrastructure plan. Maybe just regarding nuclear and kind of general federal support you\u2019re seeing at the moment just a nuclear generation in general. Tom Fanning : So this is an excellent question. Here\u2019s my view. And let me speak broadly. The administration, if they\u2019re going to hit their aspiration of 80% removal by 2030 and 100% net zero by 2035, and then move the whole economy to net zero by 2050. This is an important and awfully complex and difficult undertaking. And we are ready to support them however we can. And this is part of the conversations we\u2019ve been having on an ongoing basis with this administration. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve talked with Gina McCarthy before on a different level, I\u2019ll be talking with her again next Tuesday. I think the administration gets it, that there needs to be a whole different level of public, private cooperation and collaboration, carrots and sticks, in order to get this done, I will say, talk in the book of nuclear that it\u2019s important for the United States to keep nuclear as a priority. And so anything they can do to help to keep the nuclear assets alive really helps the United States broadly with their long-term goal. And that not only includes, projects like ours, current nuclear assets in operation that are at risk because of an imperfect market design, but also providing R&D support for the so-called Gen 4 reactors that may appear in the 2030 timeframe. All of this is an important part to achieving net zero for the economy by 2050. Unidentified Analyst : And then maybe just one more coming out of the federal level just high level thoughts, I mean we\u2019ve seen I think some companies the early stages talking about kind of carbon sequestration, some focus on maybe improving some of the tax credits on that side. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything that\u2019s on your radar or kind of how far away you see that technology at this point. Tom Fanning : Let me just say this. I think the wide build that\u2019s kind of floating around right now is pretty supportive to kind of a long-term objective. So I would take a look at that piece of proposed legislation and see what it has. That\u2019s a pretty good start. There could be lots of other things. It\u2019s interesting. I did some media this morning and people were asking me kind of specific ideas. At this point there is more ideas than there are solutions, but we\u2019re going to need to work together carrots and sticks. And you know what, at the end of the day, the objective function is not just carbon. For the American economy, it goes back to my work at the fed. It is so important to the fabric of our economic health as a nation. We got to get this right and then getting it right. We\u2019ve got to balance the notions of clean, safe, reliable, and affordable. So all of these must work in balance to achieve a good result for this nation. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate it. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Thanks for joining us. Andrew Weisel : Hey, thanks for having me. I\u2019ve got a quick one on the balance sheet. It looks like you\u2019ve dropped the expected debt financing plan for the next few years by over $2 billion. I imagine a bulk of that is the billion dollars of freed up working capital and pairing credit support related to Sequent. Does that also include cash proceeds from the sale and are there noteworthy factors there? Tom Fanning : Wait a minute. I\u2019m going to turn this over to Drew. The broad conclusion of your question is no. None of this has anything to do with Sequent at this point. Drew Evans : Andrew, I\u2019d just say, the reason it dropped is because we did the long-term debt issuance of $2 billion. Sequent really only changes what we would provision for short-term working capital, so that would come out of bank revolvers and the like. But I would say if you aggregate what we actually issued in the first half, you\u2019d come up with a number that\u2019s almost exactly the same as what we had projected when we met with you last, but we can \u2013 we\u2019re happy to walk you through the table, I think it\u2019s Page 19 or something like that in the earnings packet. Andrew Weisel : Okay. My mistake, I think I just misread that table then. Sorry about that. But the $2 billion from Sequent would be incremental or no. Drew Evans : No. So we will \u2013 the sale will occur at or around book value plus or minus that\u2019s a relatively small number, won\u2019t have major implications for cash generation. We\u2019ll then be able to reduce revolvers, because we\u2019re getting a return of working capital. These numbers are an order of magnitude smaller than what you\u2019re looking at on Slide 19. The other $800 million generally takes the form of parent guarantees or assurances for the underlying transactions that Sequent has entered into. Those aren\u2019t the nominated on the balance sheet. They\u2019re sort of off balance sheet assurances from parents. And so we\u2019ll leave at that, yes. Andrew Weisel : Okay, understood. Thanks for explaining that. Then just one quick one on COVID, are you able to provide some numbers around active cases of COVID and absenteeism on the construction site? Tom, I think you said they\u2019re trending lower, but are you able to quantify that and without getting into sensitive information, do you have any sense of vaccination rates among workers on the site? Tom Fanning : I don\u2019t on vaccination rates. I know they\u2019re up. I saw a report recently that another 500 got vaccinated. I do know that. I can\u2019t tell you what percent of the workforce is vaccinated that may violate HIPAA rules and all sorts of things. But right now, I mean I\u2019ll just tell you the current report card only 20 people are tested positive for COVID on the site. At other times, we\u2019ve had hundreds in that vein. The total positives since the project has begun at 25,000, we\u2019ve had nearly 10,000 people tested. We only have 75 people in isolation right now. And that number, I think in one reporting period has been 500. Andrew Weisel : Yes. Tom Fanning : So it\u2019s way down, but you know that ebbs and flows and \u2013 yes, it is great to hear. I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with these new variants and everything else. We are hopeful that the worst is behind us. Andrew Weisel : Agreed, fingers crossed. All right. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, thank you for taking\u2026 Tom Fanning : Hey Michael, how about those yellow jackets, man? Michael Lapides : You know what [indiscernible] super nice guy. Tom Fanning : Yes, yes. Michael Lapides : Easy question for you. It\u2019s been a while, but you all had previously I think disclosed what your potential coal ash remediation liabilities were. I think it\u2019s been a couple of years. Can you talk about what that number is in dollar billions and the timeline you think you have to meet those requirements for the planes that are still operating. And to be honest, how material is \u2013 are the coal ash and CCR regs to not just your coal fleet, but the entire regions coal fleet. Tom Fanning : I\u2019ll turn this over to Drew. It\u2019s $10 billion over 10 years. Drew Evans : Yes. And Michael, I think you can probably find all of that. We do a pretty decent detail of it in the 10-K every year. And so you can take a look at how that, that has modulated. As Tom said, it\u2019s about $10 billion over 10 years. If I think about what\u2019s in our five-year plan, probably 30%, maybe at most 40% of it is contained within that five-year period and then the balance hangs out over the end of that. Michael Lapides : But for operating \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to get my arms around, how important of a factor this is in the retire, not retire decision for existing plant \u2013 for operating plants. Tom Fanning : It\u2019s not important at all. I don\u2019t think, I made it, I came out one annual meeting and said we were going to get \u2013 we\u2019re going to retire all our ash columns. And we did that before there was any legislation and all that other stuff. We were really ahead of the game there. I really think the more important issues going forward are things like the effluent limitation guideline. It\u2019s going to be a big deal. What is that? We\u2019ve got to declare by around October. So for sure, we are working with our regulators and the staff to get our arms around that issue, because you kind of have to make a declaration. And then as we said, I think in the script that those conclusions would be a central part of our filings in Alabama and in Georgia with respect to the integration \u2013 integrated resource plan. Drew Evans : The only thing I\u2019d also point you to maybe is that we will have to make filings against the ELG requirements that\u2019s effluent limitation guidelines in October, that will require us to specify for each facility that we operate, whether we intend to make investment, to continue its operation, whether we expect to close that facility or whether we will make some investment to put that facility into a condition that will allow it to operate something like 10% of the year. But I would say that coal, we are not producing generally wet ash and is not part of our investment or closing decisions on those facilities. Almost everything is based on economics and then the other constraint that we might face perhaps at the federal level. Tom Fanning : Hey, and I\u2019m going to reach back to other earnings calls, when I remember I raised myself skepticism about our CapEx that we show. I still think it\u2019s thin. And we talked about transmission as a component of it\u2019s been this. I believe that as you take all these issues going forward, when you start retiring coal plants, the generation has to come from somewhere. And when you think about renewables being so important, we need to think about reevaluating our long-term transmission plan in order to hit those kinds of objectives. And it may be that retired coal plants could be prime areas to locate some of those resources and built by our host company. But look this is going to evolve over the next, I don\u2019t know, 10 months to 12 months. We\u2019ll have a lot more information for you later. I do think the Mississippi signal is pretty important. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Drew. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Durgesh, great to have you with us. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good afternoon, Tom. Thanks for taking my question. Tom Fanning : You bet. Durgesh Chopra : Maybe I\u2019ll start with Drew and then my Vogtle question for you, come back to you. Just Drew, on the quarter, the weather was looks like a bad guy versus normal. I\u2019m trying to reconcile to the $0.98 to the $0.84 guy. Is that predominantly just better COVID trends? Drew Evans : It is. So if you think about what we experienced, we were expecting kind of a sideways COVID relative to what we experienced in fourth quarter and what we actually saw was something that was really just about a 1.5% reduction in total retail sales. If you think about where we were for the year, last year, we were down in aggregate kind of 3% on average in almost 7.5% on peak. And we\u2019re just projecting forward as we think about second quarter assuming that we don\u2019t really see much improvement from where we are today. So a little bit of sideways until we get a better understanding of what\u2019s coming down the pike in terms of COVID. Tom Fanning : And Drew, our COVID estimates were of the vintage of last October, somewhere around there. Drew Evans : Sure, for budgeting purposes. Tom Fanning : And I think it stands we could reevaluate what the effect may be going forward. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. I mean I guess this is just the first quarter and you sort of the balance three quarters to go. So you\u2019ll reevaluate guidance as we move along, but clearly you had a very strong start and look like on COVID terms, which early better than expectations. Drew Evans : That\u2019s right. We always evaluate our guidance in October after we\u2019ve gotten through the summer season. If you think about the major factors that influence outcome there \u2013 weather is always a dominant one, that\u2019s difficult to predict COVID for sure is difficult to predict. We want to make sure that we\u2019re making the proper investments and making the right expenditures in each of our states. And so we\u2019ve got a provision for that in the second quarter. And then just know that in terms of total earnings, we would be disappointed if we\u2019re not towards the top end of the range this year, but certainly we have limitations as it relates to earned ROEs and commitments back to customers. And so those adjustments typically hit in the fourth quarter that tend to modulate earnings into a much tighter range with the primary goal being very little variability in what we report relative to expectations. Tom Fanning : With respect to those modulating effects, those are the above the top of the range. Drew Evans : Above the top, right. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Very helpful guys. Maybe just Tom, on the \u2013 for the next six to eight weeks, as you are sort of doing this Hot Functional Testing, can you just maybe elaborate on the specific risks and what remediation actions could you take in responding to those risks? Tom Fanning : You mean within the test? Durgesh Chopra : Yes. Tom Fanning : Okay, sure. So we\u2019re off to a good start with a test, although it is so early. But for whatever it is, three or four days of getting started here, it\u2019s gone well. Recall the 45-day test is essentially, 30 days of ramping up pressure and temperature, and then 15 days of ramping down pressure and temperature. Don\u2019t get excited if we\u2019re different than 45 days. We actually did some work in advance of declaring in service, but I would assume that you\u2019re going to be 45 days, if it\u2019s 50 days, it\u2019s no big deal. Okay. But that\u2019s kind of the plan 45 days. Then we open the hood up just like you bought a car and drove it for a month. Now you\u2019re going to look at it and see, did everything work like it was posted. So there are stages along the way as you think about, I don\u2019t have it with me right here, but there is a detailed path of different checkpoints along the way. I think in fact, it\u2019s eminent. We\u2019re going to raise temperature to 175 degrees. I mean that might happen tonight. It might happen Friday. I mean but that\u2019s the first level. And then every incremental rise they start checking system. I think the real thing I\u2019m looking for that goes to risk is really the integration of everything like for example. We have tested all of our RCPs, reactor coolant pumps. We\u2019ve tested them briefly all four of them running together. Now we\u2019re going to run together for some period of time. Do all of the support systems work. So not only do we have primary power in the integration of the plant, we have external backup sources that have to work. So this is the final cruise, if you will, before fuel load that make sure that the integration of all of the pieces we\u2019ve checked so far do work. The culmination of all this is we\u2019re going to raise temperatures up to about 560 degrees and we will create steam and we will send it to the turbine and we will spin the turbine. Okay. So this is kind of big stuff. The only thing that will remain then finish the construction on some of the support systems and then load fuel. Durgesh Chopra : Very helpful. Thank you, Tom. Appreciate the time. Tom Fanning : You bet. You bet. Thank you. Thanks for joining us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey Paul, how are you? Paul Fremont : Doing great, Tom. Thanks a lot. And congratulations on this startup hot functional. I want to start off with maybe a follow-up to Angie\u2019s question. You talked about a change of schedule, I think June of last year, I think you added 500,000 construction hours. Can you just tell us in layman\u2019s terms roughly how many days or weeks that 500,000 hours represents? Tom Fanning : So that kind of \u2013 that\u2019s an interesting question, because I guess if you\u2019re talking about the history of Unit 3, it feels like maybe two months, but obviously you got to think about when you\u2019re spending that. When I say two months, I\u2019m looking over the whole period. There are some months where there was a boatload of hours. And right now, for example, construction is just about done. I think going back to Angie\u2019s question. I mean there\u2019s a tiny bit of what I would call construction left following a HFT, and it\u2019s for the support systems and a little bit associated with nuclear fuel. So it depends kind of where you are, but these all fit into \u2013 I would think of them distributed over the whole curve of construction. So hard to say my best guess is two months, well, we\u2019ll see. Paul Fremont : Okay. And then there\u2019s obviously remediation work that is now going to be added to that. So instead of 500,000 hours, what would the total amount of construction hours look like including all of the remediation that you need to do after Hot Functional Testing? Tom Fanning : So is the question how many hours remain after hot functional test, a fuel load? Paul Fremont : Correct? Tom Fanning : Is that your question? Paul Fremont : Construction. Yes, construction hours. Tom Fanning : Maybe 200,000, something like that. We\u2019ll finish most of that in June, yes, about that. Paul Fremont : The 5,000 hours that were budgeted last year is no longer the case that it\u2019s not 500,000 hours anymore. Tom Fanning : It\u2019s already been accounted for, the way I would say it. All of that, you may remember at one time Paul, we were talking about, gosh, I mean I can remember back when we reset the schedule, we thought we might get fuel load by the end of the year. And then the latest update we gave you all before the 8-K as we thought HFT would begin at the end of March, the last two weeks in March. And then when we saw that we had to remediate some of these issues, we pushed into April that gave rise to the 8-K. And now we\u2019ve given you a new schedule, new costs, that account for HFT as of April 25. We say that according to the schedule with 20 days of margin, but according to the schedule that would give you a very late December and service. Remember if it was March, it was November. If it\u2019s April, it must be December. And April 25 gives you late December. And as we said, if there\u2019s any more delays, it could push you into the first quarter. But I\u2019m \u2013 I hope I\u2019m answering your right question, because the 500,000 hours has already been incorporated into schedule. It\u2019s been incorporated into costs. It\u2019s already accounted for with 200,000 hours left between kind of now and beginning of fuel load. I hope I\u2019m hitting the right answer. I hope I\u2019m hitting what you\u2019re asking. Paul Fremont : Okay. And then it looks like you have \u2013 you\u2019ve got about 53 turnovers remaining out of 159. Is that a fair characterization? And then it also looks like you\u2019ve averaged about 10.5 turnovers per month from October through April. Is that fair? Tom Fanning : I wouldn\u2019t use that logic. Turnovers are all determined by wind systems clear to major tests. So we have about 50 left. I wouldn\u2019t think about them as, oh, well, you do x per month that they really are determined by here, the presence of HFT. We had to pass a lot of systems to get the HFT. We have 50 more to go, less than 10% of those are what I would call safety related. The rest are support, et cetera, as I\u2019ve described. So don\u2019t think about it on per month. Think about it on time to systems and what remains. And we feel that we can do this before fuel load. I mean we\u2019ve given you the schedule. If you try to, I\u2019m afraid, I\u2019m afraid from your question. If you\u2019re trying to say, oh, well, you\u2019ve done 4.5 per month and you got 50 left that says another 10 months. That\u2019s not the right logic. If that was your question, it\u2019s not ratable analysis. Paul Fremont : Okay, fair enough. So basically I think what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019ve got an estimated 200,000 construction hours from the time you come out of Hot Functional Testing until fuel load. Is that reasonable in terms of\u2026 Tom Fanning : Yes. Paul Fremont : Of a conclusion, okay. Drew Evans : Paul, we\u2019d think about this is that \u2013 we expected a certain reduction in intensity between hot functional test and fuel load and we\u2019ll just have to maintain intensity for a little bit longer to make sure we meet fuel load on a timely basis. Tom Fanning : Hey Paul, one more piece of logic. We get these reports all the time in our big meetings. Remember I\u2019ve described these meetings where our process are effectively, completely transparent. In other words, system independent monitors in there, represents in the Georgia Public Service Commission staff, co-owners, NRC, DOE, everybody\u2019s in there. Okay. We do an evaluation. There\u2019s this gigantic long chart that maps out all of the systems that need to be complete over time. One of the things I probably haven\u2019t said it clearly to you as I will now. When you think about the remaining systems between say, hot functional and fuel load, every one of those remaining 50 systems are over 90% complete. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re starting from ground zero. So you\u2019re really finishing up, what is effectively almost complete construction. Maybe that\u2019s helpful. Paul Fremont : Yes, actually it is. And then my last question is, I guess when you did a root cause analysis on the need for remediation, you concluded that a motivation to credit construction hours as earned drove supervisors to turnover work to Southern Nuclear for testing without first correcting deficiencies in the work. Is it possible that the level of earned hours then would also have been inflated by the fact that they were turning over work before it was actually adequately tact? Tom Fanning : Yes, that may have been true. I mean it\u2019s possible. But that\u2019s all a little bit of bayoneting the dead. In other words, we are where we are right now. And I think that probably did cause the recognition of what was effectively complete as opposed to work that remained that needed to be remediated was not as clear as it could have been. So what we\u2019re giving you right now is a completely transparent view as to where we are and what needs to be done in order to complete. I think that analysis was kind of backward looking. Paul Fremont : Can you maybe the last question, I think \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. Go ahead. Tom Fanning : No, the only thing I would just say they should reappear in Unit 4, because we\u2019ve taken into account those issues. Paul Fremont : And then I think on this third quarter call, you were talked about 45 days, I think for a hot functional and then another 55 days between the end of hot functional and fuel load. Is that still the schedule that that we should be thinking about? Tom Fanning : Yes, we\u2019ve added about, I don\u2019t know, nearly two weeks internet schedule. You remember Paul from prior calls, we had gosh, I want to say a little over a month in a startup from fuel load to in-service. And we took \u2013 we said this some time ago, we took about two weeks and added it into the Hot Functional Test to fuel load. So you should think now that total period is kind of, well, I don\u2019t know, 70 days. Okay. We just added contingency in there. We added more margin. And we did that at the same time to, I think this was Angie, we did that at the same time that we push some work that was around 2020, I want to say somewhere around there where we push some work beyond HFT and a fuel load and also some last quarter. Paul Fremont : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Tom Fanning : Hey, and thank you for raising all these questions. They\u2019re all very important. So Paul, we sure appreciate your clarification here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Levi with HITE Hedge. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Andrew, how you\u2019re doing? Andrew Levi : I\u2019m all right. Hey, could do this to everybody 2.5 hours\u2026 Tom Fanning : Which mean this stuff is right. Andrew Levi : My brain hurts from the last one, from all the questions, but this is of Nuclear. So I just kind of have a thought about you guys and about where the industry is going. And Tom, you and I go way back as far as the industry and back in the 1990s, when deregulation was starting, it was caused by very, very high electric rates. And there was something called the Super Southeast and those stocks traded at a premium. And then you\u2019ve got companies like Kentucky Utilities and other companies with lower rates that traded at a premium. So fast forward to now, and fast forward to what the Biden administration is proposing and where the industry is headed. Now you have very high rates in the Northeast, mainly TND companies that really don\u2019t have any levers to reduce their rates or to keep rates flat. So then I look at like Southern Company again, we got to get through this nuclear plant build. But once that is done, can you maybe talk about and you have at a very high level, but the opportunity to transform your key and obviously you\u2019ve talked about that, but maybe the cost savings around that and the opportunity there and what will happen to your electric rates longer-term relative to other parts of the country. And also basically, what that will do longer-term again, I\u2019m thinking the longer-term for your growth opportunities. Tom Fanning : Yes. Andy, it\u2019s a very interesting question, but here\u2019s the thing. I think the wisdom of the integrated regulated model will bear fruit significantly as we consider some of these issues. In the so-called organized markets, there is very little control as to constructing an optimal portfolio, number one. Number two, when you think about the portfolio, we should consider that it includes transmission. Number three, I think the fact that part of the secret sauce here is reconfiguring the portfolio, absent coal, coal carries with it a whole lot of O&M. And so not only is there optionality in terms of the generation and transmission, we will provide. I think by our planning processes, we can do that in a way that\u2019s much more orderly and effective and efficient, then the organized market. And then finally, when you consider the O&M, that could be freed up by closing down some of these O&M intensive facilities like coal plants. We have the ability to use that O&M to keep rates lower then you\u2019ll find elsewhere in the country. Certainly, even compared to those companies that are just wires only. Their ability to deliver the kind of price, shock absorbers, doesn\u2019t exist, because they will be takers of costs from the market. So I can assure you that we\u2019ve already been talking about these issues with our regulators, with our stockholders. I mean our stakeholders and I can think that we \u2013 as my earnings call, but I think we\u2019re better positioned in this kind of model in this region then elsewhere in the United States. Andrew Levi : Great. Thank you very much. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Yes. I just want to maybe end with Andy\u2019s comment there. This is a very exciting time for us all. We\u2019re making great progress on Vogtle. I think we resolve the delays and we think we have a clearer path. Every month that goes by, we reduce remaining risk in the project. And so I think we continue to progress this thing. And boy, I can tell you the site for all the work they\u2019re putting in is really starting to see the dividends of all their efforts. And so I can tell you, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we are imbued with enthusiasm. When I think about the days ahead, in terms of transitioning the fleet Southern Company is committed to constructive collaboration, not just cooperation, collaboration with the United States government to achieve their aspirations. And so we will work together. I love our cards in this regard. I know a lot of people give you a lot of rhetoric about where they say they are and what they have done. I would rather have our cards and almost anybody else\u2019s going forward as we address the future. Thanks everybody for your attendance today. I know it went a little long, but I always enjoy interactions. And I know I always get a lot out of the questions you ask. Thanks again. Have a great next quarter and we\u2019ll see you again in July. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company first quarter 2021 earnings call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday July, 29, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you. Rita. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's second quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements today. In addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. Drew and I will cover our usual business updates in a few moments, but first, let me provide an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing is complete. Through the testing, we have validated the operation of critical primary and secondary systems at full temperature and pressure and demonstrated that the design basis is sound. The completion of Hot Functional testing marks the last major milestone before and represent a significant step towards placing Unit 3 in service. So, the duration of Hot Functional testing was longer than we originally anticipated, we remain committed to getting it right, for all aspects of the project. Taking into account the length of hot functional testing for Unit 3, the remaining activities for both units, and recent productivity trends, we now project placing Unit 3 in service during the second quarter of 2022 and Unit 4 in service during the first quarter of 2023. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $460 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, recent productivity trends and replenishment of contingency to fund expected future risks. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after tax charge of $343 million during the second quarter. With Unit 3 Hot Functional testing complete, our next and final major milestone for Unit 3 is fuel load. We project fuel load to occur sometime near year-end 2021 or early in 2022. As we approach fuel load, our commitment to get it right remains our top priority. And as the operator of these units, safety is our paramount objective and we strive to meet first-time quality standards prior to significant testing and operations activity. We will not sacrifice those commitments to meet schedule or milestone dates. The scope and time required for the work remaining to prior to fuel load includes; one, completion of the nuclear fuel systems and the associated documentation, or paper, as I referred to it in the past; two, completion of remediation work and additional work identified during hot functional testing; three, completion of the work necessary to implement our plant support systems; and four, a reduction and productivity level consistent with recent site performance. Unit 3 ITAAC submittal and review process is ongoing and continues to follow our construction and testing activities on site. To-date, 208 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 191 as we approach fuel load. Recently, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted a special inspection of electrical quality issues that we had identified earlier this year, and the remediation efforts that are underway. The on-site inspection is complete and we expect the NRC's report to be published within a couple of months, though that exact timing will of course be determined by the NRC. Turning to Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 84% complete and we achieved initial energization in May. Our revised construction productivity assumptions are consistent with recent trends. And as I mentioned, we now project an in-service date during the first quarter of 2023 for Unit 4. Our updated timeline for Unit 4 is reflective of several factors. First, Unit 4 experienced a slower than expected recovery from our COVID-19 related staffing reductions in early 2020. We call, at the time, the staffing reduction disproportionately impacted Unit 4 as we shifted our focus to Unit 3 critical path work fronts. We call, we reduced the density of personnel on the site and effectively move people from Unit 4 to Unit 3. Second, Unit 3 timeline, leading up to and during hot functional testing, delayed our plans to transition resources to Unit 4. More recently, we have staffed Unit 4 independently as work on Unit 3 continues. And third, over the past three months the growing economy and demand for skilled labor has impacted our ability to attract and retain electricians and, as a result, we experienced higher than expected attrition. Attaining the necessary levels of craft labor to meet construction milestones for Unit 4 has been more challenging than expected. In recent weeks, we have seen positive staffing trends, driven in part by offering the enhanced electrician compensation, which has helped to mitigate further schedule impact. Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month, since the start of this year. To achieve in November 2022 in service, we estimate Unit 4 would need to average 1.9% construction completion per month, and to support our first quarter 2023 in service, Unit 4 would need to average construction completion of approximately 1.3% per month for the rest of this year. Looking now at cost the $460 million pre-tax charge recorded during the second quarter reflects the schedule update for both units, including updated assumptions for construction activity and support resources, as well as replenishing the contingency for potential cost risks associated with completing both units. In conclusion, while the timing of Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing took longer than originally expected, I am encouraged by the success of the test. Even so, with completion of this enormous milestone, we still have a lot of important work ahead of us to get to fuel load. For Unit 4, we are focused on progressing through the next several milestones, while continuing to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic and broader economic recovery efforts that have impacted productivity at both sites. As a company and a management team, we remain focused on bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. As always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important statewide project. Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financial. Drew Evans : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone, I hope you all are well. First, I want to touch on the financial impacts of today's Vogtle update. We continue to be very committed to credit quality for both Georgia Power and Southern Company. Therefore, Southern Company will contribute capital down to Georgia Power to maintain its target capital structure and credit profile. We expect to fund the cash need at the parent company as it is incurred by reinstating new issuances under our internal equity plans, primarily the dividend reinvestment plan, which is expected to produce approximately $400 million over the next year. Importantly, with this financing strategy, we expect to maintain Southern Company's credit profile with consolidated credit metrics above current downgrade thresholds. This has a de minimis impact on earnings given our size, and we continue to see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range and we are also reiterating our 2024 projected EPS range of $4 to $4.30. Turning now to earnings; we had strong performance in the second quarter of 2021 with adjusted earnings per share of $0.84, $0.06 higher than both last year's second quarter and our estimate. Recall in the second quarter of last year we were experiencing the peak impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our kilowatt-hour sales. This peak was primarily related to shelter and place mandates and working remote. And in response, we implemented significant cost savings initiatives. Therefore, it is no surprise that the primary drivers of our quarterly earnings this year, as compared to last year, we increased customer usage at our state regulated utilities, coupled with strong customer growth in the Southeast, as well as constructive state regulatory actions. As you would expect with rising kilowatt hour sales versus last year, our non-fuel O&M was higher due to increased maintenance and planned outages at our generating units. Weather impacts for the quarter were negligible year-over-year. When looking at adjusted EPS, as compared to our estimates for the quarter, the main drivers of the increased earnings were customer growth, that remains higher than our expectation, new connects are exceeding forecast by 25% and continued expense discipline. Year-to-date through June 2021, adjusted EPS is higher by $0.26 compared to the first six months of last year. Drivers are similar to those for the second quarter; increased usage, stronger customer growth, constructive state regulatory actions and are partially offset by higher non-fuel O&M. Year-to-date weather impacts were $0.08 favorable compared to the prior year and $0.05 unfavorable as compared to normal. A detailed reconciliation of these reported in adjusted quarterly and year-to-date results, as compared to 2020, are included in today's release and the earnings package. Turning to the economies in our service territory, we continue to see significant improvement from the lows we are experiencing at this time last year related to the pandemic. In the second quarter, weather normal retail sales in aggregate were up by 6% compared to last year, with commercial and industrial segments saw sharply and modest declines in residential sales. We have been analyzing retail sales compared to pre-COVID levels to assess recovery relative to historical norms. An early data indicate that in aggregate, our retail sales, have recovered to between 97% and 98% of 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Sales in the residential segment remained elevated due to continued hybrid working, while industrial and commercial sales remain slightly below the 2019 comparable; something like 97% of the 2019 level. In the Industrial segment, we are seeing strong momentum across nearly all sub-segments, commercial sales are also improving though sales may take longer to reach historical norms. As the COVID-19 delta variant becomes more widespread in the service territories, we will closely monitor for any signs of change, but have yet to see any material impacts. Underpinning these positive sales trends as a strong labor market evidenced by shrinking unemployment rates that are below 4% in both Georgia and Alabama. In addition, customer growth remains robust with new connects significantly outpacing our expectations across the electric utilities, reflecting construction new homes, as well as new commercial businesses and continued in net migration. Economic development continues to be very active in the Southeast. In Georgia alone there are over 200 active projects with the potential to bring over 30,000 jobs in the coming years. Capital investment and job announcements are far outpacing what we experienced even before the pandemic. These are positive signals for continued improvement of both customer growth and sales. With our solid adjusted results for the first half of the year, we are well positioned as we head into the peak electric load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2021 is $1.22 per share on an adjusted basis and consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to this EPS guidance after the third quarter. With that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Drew. We understand that global news often dominates our earnings calls, but I think it's important that we also focus on the terrific performance we see across our businesses. As Drew highlighted, our adjusted financial results of the first half are outstanding, and operationally, we are performing well. We have already endured a tropical storm in Georgia earlier this summer and our system has demonstrated resilience during the extreme temperatures experienced throughout this week in the Southeast. I would like to mention one more topic before we take your questions. Five years ago this month, we closed on our acquisition of AGL Resources, now known as Southern Company Gas. Our objective with the transaction was to deliver even greater customer shareholder value by continuing to invest in high quality predominantly state regulated utility assets, and we have done just that. We bolstered investment at the regulated gas utilities, continued to strengthen the position of our Retail Natural Gas franchise in Georgia, and divested non-regulated asset. Over the past five years. Southern Company Gas has; one, increased its JD Power customer satisfaction scores; two, increased its regulated business mix to 90%; three, increased its authorized equity ratios to 55%; four, increased our annual growth in rate base by 14% - by an average of 14% annually; Fifth, raised $3 billion from the sale of non-strategic assets, some at all-time high PE multiples and reduced risk by selling assets like the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Sequent Asset Management business; and then seventh, all while increasing opportunities for talented leaders to take on new and important roles across the Southern Company enterprise. A great example to that is sitting right next to me, Drew Evans, our Chief Financial Officer is doing a terrific job. And his breadth of experience and engaging thought process has helped us all. In summary, the acquisition has far exceeded our own expectations. The positive result of our gas business are indicative of the approach we take across all of our businesses and to the nine million customers and communities we are privileged to serve. This approach best positions our state regulated utility-centric business model for the future as we seek to maximize our return to shareholders on a risk adjusted basis. Once again, I want to thank everyone for being with us this afternoon. Operator, we'll go ahead and open the floor for question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Julien, how are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, this is actually Cody Clark on for Julien. How are you? Tom Fanning : Oh, okay. Great, fantastic. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, maybe first, if we can talk about Hot Functional testing. I'm wondering how you're thinking about the post-test analysis that you're kind of working through right now, you took temperature back down to [indiscernible]. And I'm wondering, this year, assuming that you have all the data now that you can kind of proceed, is there still the potential risk for additional remediation work there? Tom Fanning : So, let me call a couple of things out that's interesting, I think. Number one is, everything is progressing right now as we said it would. In other words, now that we've completed HFT effectively, we take the car, and lift the hood, and look at the engine, and see what happened. The experience in China showed that there shouldn't be any big things happen. That's our experience in China. But certainly, that's an important part of work. The other thing I just want to point out because I know this has been a topic on prior calls, just want to raise this. If you recall, I want to say it was the first unit that went through HFT in China, actually had to re-perform their HFT. So they had significant operational issues concerning vibrations and a variety of other things. And that took over six months. We have passed through those issues, we learn from them, and for the issues they experienced, our plant worked great. So, we are as we thought we would be. And of course, between now and fuel load, as we called out in the script, there is certainly four big areas we do have to work on. I love page five, I think slide five, on the information we've given you guys this morning, you see Vogtle Unit 3, Cooling Tower actually has water vapor coming out of it. That was such a wonderful site to see. I was on site, frankly, when that was going on. But look, it was heated with affluent heat from the reactor coolant pumps, who performed beautifully during the test. Now we're going to heat it with nuclear fuel. So, we got to put all the systems necessary to get nuclear fuel in there and use that as the heat source. Secondly, as we went through the process of starting HFT, and then through HFT, we found some things we can do better to improve the long-term operation of the plant. We will do those things. And then, I called this out on the last call. We call them plant support systems, but this is essentially balance of plant activities HVAC portable water some signage, things like that that are necessary to support an operating workforce at the plant goes live. And then finally, we made an adjustment, we reduced actually our estimate of productivity of the workforce on site to more closely match our recent experience but that's what's left to get to fuel load. All of these things represent a significant effort, but I will say that the biggest risk was getting the HFT and completing HFT in an excellent manner, and we did that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, understood. Thank you for that. Tom Fanning : And to be specific, one more thing, we have seen no data so far that gives us any concern, if that was part of your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. No, that's helpful. That's helpful. So, can you give us a little bit more color on attrition at the site, and I know that was brought up and some of the stat, in PCM testimony [ph]; what are you assuming in the new schedule and especially considering the enhanced pay that you mentioned? Tom Fanning : Yes. So, we went through a period there. So we were really focused on getting HFT, getting into it, and going through it, and all that. And so, we weren't planning on doing a lot. Further, some of the quality issues we recognized - we want to make sure that we fully understood the scope of everything that we were finding so that we didn't repeat those mistakes on Unit 4, which I think we've done. At one point, during our meetings with co-owners, and the NRC, and the PSC staff, and Dr. Jacobs, and everybody that we deal with, we were seeing greater than expected attrition. And we really lay that out to, I think, the improving economy in the Southeast, but really big data centers that were attracting electricians. So, we exited two stages of compensation increases that really arrested that. So, I want to say, one week we hired 25 electricians and we lost like 72. And when we saw that, we were going, oh man, we've got to fix that. And I think now we have. Recent experience would say that since the adjustment in June - so, this would be, maybe four weeks of activity, we net added now, so these are net adds, 350 people. So, we have about a 1000 now and we'd like to get to 1200. So, there is still some hiring activity going forward for Unit 4 but we feel good about our ability to do that. And the other important point here is Unit 4 now is on an independent track from Unit 3. Okay? And we used to - and in fact, in prior earnings calls, we talked about, oh, an optimal relationship is nine months and 12 months. We have stopped the idea. It no longer is applicable to think about the track for Unit 3. Unit 4 is now on an independent path from Unit 3. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then, just one more if I can. Tom Fanning : Yes, sure. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just wondering what the impact of the of the delta variant is on staff and if you're assuming any impacts from this in the current schedule? Tom Fanning : Yes, absolutely. So, what we have been - we went through a period where there was just a handful of positive tests and they are up a little bit. Let's see, I guess our - we've had something like - since the start of the pandemic, something like 2600 people impacted. Right now, we have somewhere around 65. Okay? That would be our latest data. That's an increase. Probably a week or two ago, it was 25. About a week before that, it might have been 10. So yes, it is picking up. The other thing we're seeing is that, for those that are impacted, the severity of the illness associated with the virus, has been less significant. One other thing I do want to say, I don't think we have a slide here that shows the progression of HFT, It took us a while to get to full temperature, full pressure, but once we got there, the plant is running like a champion. It really has been stable. So, lots of little things along the way, we fixed them, and once we got there, it's been very stable. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, that's great. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll jump back in the queue. Tom Fanning : Thank you for joining us. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Jeremy. How are you? Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good afternoon. It's actually Ryan on for Jeremy. Tom Fanning : Okay. Jeremy Tonet : I guess, just wanted to ask one on any expectations that you kind of have heading into this kind of NRC kind of report. And then, they're very explicit about the Unit 4 timeline, but if there is any kind of - any kind of baked in there for Unit 4 regarding what might come out of that report, any kind of additional remediation or adjustments that might be required? Tom Fanning : Yes. But I mean, this doesn't go necessary to the NRC report but rather it goes to - it really was involved and the time it took to get to HFT and the remediation plans we put in place to satisfy the quality issues we saw in the paper. And remember paper. It's shorthand for turning over from construction to system testing, to documentation necessary of the nuclear quality, necessary to submit an ITAC. Okay? So, when I say paper, it's actually a big deal. And I've said that in the past three or four call, what a big deal it was. And it has been a big deal. So, we put in processors in place to improve that effort. And our new schedule does include the effect of those processes, okay. The only other thing I want to say about the NRC is; this is their report, and it's in their hands. So, I certainly - as I wouldn't speak for a state regulator in any of our jurisdictions. I'm not going to speak to the NRC. I will say, as we have been completely transparent in all of our site meeting with all the co-owners, all, everybody there, the NRC is fully aware of what we found, and they are fully aware of our remediation practices. And that's about all I want to say about that. Let the NRC speak for themselves beyond that. Jeremy Tonet : No, understood. Totally understand. And then, I guess, you guys mentioned the kind of the internal equity programs as a combination - I just kind of want to get a sense on the timing there. It sounds like, just over the next year - with the $40 million [ph] in trip or what kind of - maybe take longer, as kind of plan to potentially come online? Just got to make sure I have understood the message there. Drew Evans : Yes. Maybe I can give you a couple of sort of boundaries on this. Understand that what we'll experience or what we just reported in terms of increased costs, we won't actually experience until we start to move later into construction. So, these are incremental to budgets that really begin sometime next April. The sum total of those things, led to the write-down that we report today of $343 million. We are incredibly focused on credit and felt like there was a necessity to fulfill commitments that we've made to the rating agencies related to our coverage ratios in particular. And so the simplest thing for us to do is to turn on the DRIP plan, whether that's temporary or permanent, we'll just sort of monitors as we continue to monitor construction. The intent is for it to be quite temporary. But a single year of that program generates about $400 million, which I think, what we've just described to you as a debit it created by this expectation that's only three quarters of what we could issue under those plans in a particular year. But I would say that our single biggest purpose for this is that we have made commitments to rating agencies and to bondholders to maintain credit through construction and that is our singular intent. Tom Fanning : And I think you said it in the script too, Drew, that we stick to the plan. The financial plans we put in place, the guidance that we did forward, the 5% to 10% range, 4 to 4.30. The impact of turning on for some time, the DRIP, is de minimis. Jeremy Tonet : Understood. Appreciate the color. I'll leave it there. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Mike. How are you? Michael Lapides : I'm well, Tom. Thank you, Tom and Drew, for taking my questions as always. One on Vogtle, and really one on Georgia. And specifically, in Georgia, how do you envision two regulatory processes playing from here? First of all, the timeline for kind of how you think about getting Vogtle 3 and the rates and kind of really the proceeding for that or the docket for that? And then, the second question is with Vogtle moving around in schedule a little bit, how you think about the rate case that you're supposed to file next year and whether you will just kind of push that off and trying and do all of this in one big docket? Tom Fanning : Yes. So, to my admonition before, we certainly will not front run anything with the regulators or really kind of the plans that we have. I mean you, Michael, you know, you've been around forever and you follow us and do a great job with that. We've already laid out a framework to address cost recovery and prudence, and in fact, the Unit 3 rate proceeding right before the Commission is currently one of those early steps. So, let's leave it there. There is a whole lot of moving pieces in the constructive way, really, since I was involved in putting in place an accounting order methodology back in 1995, we've been able to manage really complex situations in a constructive way. And my sense is, with all the moving pieces here, we have a tough regulator, but I think they'll do a fair constructive job with it as we move forward. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then, a question about the jurisdiction no one ever talks about, no one ever asks, but obviously one of the better places to be a utility. How are you thinking about Alabama in terms of how continued change in the generation fleet may play out, as well as kind of how the pace of grid investment may change over the next three to five years? Tom Fanning : So, great investments is an interesting question. And that's a much bigger than Alabama question, right? When we look at California and we look at URI, and we look at the dysfunction in the so-called operating - the so-called organized markets, it is very clear that all of our jurisdictions, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, have a very well founded and orderly way of evaluating a transition to a generating fleet and the integration, importantly, of transmission into the overall integrated resource plan. So, we have processes in place. All of our companies have embraced, to some degree, the idea of renewables. Recall in the past Georgia Power was cited as the investor-owned utility of the year by the solar industry. Recently, Alabama Power has embraced the idea of solar being part of their mix. Everybody has a different way to approach the problem. But I would say all of our utilities have a very constructive effective way of addressing the problem. And in a way where we're accountable, whether it's fuel procurement, generation, transmission, distribution, sales, we are accountable and we work with the commission to develop optimal answers for our customers. That is the best market structure and we've been able to do it for years; my sense will continue. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciate it guys. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey Paul, How are you? Paul Patterson : All right. How are you doing? Tom Fanning : Fantastic. Thanks for being with us. Paul Patterson : Absolutely. So, just - this question just came up I think in - when I heard somebody else ask about COVID. I'm just curious, how many people - what percentage of your workforce is vaccinated? Do you have any number on that? Tom Fanning : So, we don't know. But I would argue, it's somewhere between 35 and low '40s. Drew Evans : Probably not materially different than what we've seen in the general population in the Southeast. Tom Fanning : Yes. We're not requiring people to disclose it, for example. We are requiring certain behaviors in the workforce, that if you're not vaccinated you wear a mask, you'll socially distance, etcetera. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then with respect to sales growth and COVID, I'm just wondering, as we've gotten further along, just sort of, if there is any change - what your outlook is post pandemic effects? When we're back to normal, is there a new normal in terms of what your expectations for total retail sales might be or how is that - what's your thought, I guess? Obviously, you've had a rebound and what have you. So, it's kind of noisy here. But just going forward, assuming, let's say, in 2021 - I mean, assuming at the end of 2021, we're back to normal, let's say, how would you think that the sales growth, is there any change, I guess, and what your sales growth expectations are for retail sales growth now, given the pandemic? Tom Fanning : Yes. So Paul, let Drew and I double team this, because he brings a different perspective than me. But we've given you part of the chart package, I guess, page 11. It shows that to pre-pandemic residential is still up. So, here is one of the interesting things to consider; when we evaluate our workforce pre-pandemic, roughly 80% were kind of permanently in the office with about 20%, maybe 25%, mostly virtual, think call centers and things like that. When we tried to analyze what the new normal will be, the numbers are changing pretty significantly and it varies by local location, it varies by work function. But kind of wrap your head around this. I think we're going to be between 20% and 25% kind of permanently in the office with about round numbers 50% being a hybrids; sometimes they're in the office, sometimes they are working virtually. And then, we'll have that 20%-25%, completely virtually. If the rest of the world starts to follow this idea of a new normal, then I would expect residential sales to be up prior to 2019 levels. Industrial, appears to me to be racing back to Pre-COVID. So, we're kind of at 98% there. And the economic development activity that we see, especially - I mean, I'll give you one, Amazon - I think it's Amazon, is bringing a thousand jobs and investment of $250 million; that's one. I said if you guys watched Squawk Box this morning, I told them that in the economic development data, in forward-looking investment now. So, this hasn't happened but these are announced projects, versus 2020 are up 85%; and versus 2019, are up 65%. So, there is this burst of activity from investment. And jobs created is somewhere in the mid-20. So, what's happening? Residential may remain elevated, industrial is going to catch up, commercial is still a little bit of a question; we'll see. Drew, what would you say to all that? Drew Evans : I think you did a nice job of it. The only thing I might add would be around customer count itself. And so, we normally add something like 40,000 customers in a given year. This is largely residential. And we've probably added three quarters of that in just the first half of this year. So net in migration is a little bit difficult to separate from sort of use per customer, which is what we represent here. But residential is at 3% higher than what we would have expected pre-pandemic. And I think as you described that's probably here to stay. Industrial segments, we've had a couple of large industrial customers move in and out of more global productivity, or based on global economics, not a lot based on the region not being a good employer. And there are a couple of really strong sectors like automotive where there could be huge transitions that really benefit the Southeast and some. As with you, I'm very bullish on residential and industrial in particular. Commercial is going to take a little bit longer to normalize. Tom Fanning : Yes, raw data, year-over-year. Manufacturing and Industrial was up 11.7%. The only one down there was chemicals. That was really an Olin plant that produced chlorine, caustic soda and stuff like that. And that's really, they just taken down their production, everybody else is up. We had three segments up over 30% year-over-year; primary metals, transportation and pipeline. So, [indiscernible] one last data point, which is full of this stuff. Georgia looks like it's going to be one of the first states to hit its pre-COVID level by the end of this year. And Alabama and Mississippi are expected to hit in '22. Those are some of the fastest recovering states in the United States. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then, just turning to Vogtle. The testimony by staff, I hope you guys filed a rebuttal testimony which is, I think, the normal course here. But luckily, Ben [ph] asked you to do rebuttal here or anything, but in terms of sort of this tension that they brought up about BD milestones and the quality of work and what have you, would you say with this hot functional testing that if they were to look at the situation now after that, given what you guys have found, how the plan performed with hot functional testing that perhaps those issues have - would probably be diminished? And my question, in other words, you mentioned that it performed very well. And I'm just wondering whether or not that may indicate that this quality of work issue that they were bringing up would be - would it be as significant an issue maybe as we move forward? Tom Fanning : So, here is my view on that. I think there have been a number of interesting arguments that follow your question. One that has been a consistent difference we have had with the staff. For example, it has been our dogma in doing this project to fail quickly. And so, it was I think a big risk mitigated from our standpoint to test early, find problems and fix them before they became a bigger problem later. And also, the alternative to that would have been to completely construct the system and only test it kind of when everything is done. I think that would have exacerbated the bow wave of work. The criticism, well, the way you're doing it costs more money. Yes, we would agree, but I would also say, value is a function of risk and return. For the additional cost we have followed in testing early and failing earl, the risk mitigation characteristic overwhelmed the value. Remember, it is our posture [ph] to get it right, okay. We found a lot of issues going in, not deal-killer, not huge issues, but the issues we had to deal with going into HFT. We found more during HFT and we finished HFT. We don't think we will repeat those and in Unit 4. And so, we'll deal with that. We did go through a very rigorous argument on Unit 4 about whether we should estimate it being completed in the first quarter or the second quarter. And I remember, we came back and had another argument about it. And this is like in two hour, three hour-long argument with people on the site, everybody that is involved with the project. And we landed on the first quarter. Now, let's just go through the math. Ultimately, from where we are to in service, we're kind of projecting - no, I guess, we're projecting - no, in service, we're projecting 16 months. We've added four months. So, adding four months on top of 16 is in round numbers, something like 17%, 25% or more. And so, my sense is, that's a good place to be. If you were to add another quarter, holy smokes, now you're in the - you're getting near 50% contingency income made. And for the people who were on site that felt like too much. So, listen, we had good rigorous arguments. I think we've landed in a good spot. One of the things that we're particularly watching is - so, if you say, what is the riskiest thing you're thinking about right now? So, the work ahead of us, the big work is getting the nuclear fuel ready to go to be inserted into the reactor vessel. When we look at the testing of our spent fuel pool, we found greater than acceptable leaks in the pool. We tested Unit 4, and while this testing is still ongoing, we believe that Unit 4 is looking good. So, it is not a design problem. We think it is a welding problems - frankly on Unit 3. And so, we're undertaking a complete remake of the bad, of the spent fuel pool, in order to assure the floor of the pool, to assure that it will work when it's called upon. That kind of is the biggest thing in my mind right now that I know about. Okay? I feel very confident that what we've learned on three, through the end of HFT, and now it works, we'll apply that on four in a good way. And I will say this, nearly - and I'm sorry for going on here, but let me just finish with this. We completely respect the staff opinion. And we completely respect Dr. Jacobs. We respect our co-owners. Anybody that has an opinion on this, they all have a point of view that is valid. I'm giving you what we think is the best answer and the best outcome. And the thing that is so beautiful about this process, and anybody will talk about - everybody sees everything. There are no secrets. There is no smoking gun. Everybody knows everything as we build this plant. I think that transparency has worked so much to our advantage. Paul Patterson : Awesome, thanks so much. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kuczynski with Southern Company. Please proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : No, he works for us. I don't think he - yes, that's a mistake. Go to your next question. Sorry about that everybody. Operator : Not a problem. And that will conclude today's question and answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Yes, my question is what was Steve doing on the phone? For those of you who don't know, Steve is - he's terrific. He's the CEO of our nuclear business and he has direct management council oversight for the construction of Vogtle 3 and 4. And of course, there is a staff of people there. A guy named Glen Chick has been a hero of Southern, working so hard to make this thing a success. Here is the thing, I would leave you with, and I think the feedback we're getting from the analyst community is right on point. So, I think I'm telling you what you already know. But listen, me, personally, we all, sometimes we get frustrated with the tactics of hitting a milestone and a schedule. And the integration of the entire plant and making it work with a heat source that's not nuclear, but still making it work as it did. It was prolonged and frustrating at times, but you know what, once we got it solved, and once we got the plant at pressure, at temperature, it worked great. It was very stable. So, we fix those things. And we continue to work hard to make sure we don't repeat them on four. Still a good bit of work ahead between now and fuel load. I think we've outlined that carefully for you. And so, we look forward to getting the fuel load for Unit 3. Unit 4, for the kind of productivity that we have suggested to you, let's just deal with the percent completes per month. So, the 19 to 13, right, 1.9 to 1.3, we have done already at Unit 4, 1.4, and we have done kind of the 1.9 level on Unit 3 for seven and nine months at time. So, these are levels we have done in the past. In the estimate we have given you, we have estimated, however, lower productivity. That's to give ourselves a little more margin on cost and schedule. So, we're trying to be sensitive to really hit these numbers. Outside of Vogtle, we're very excited about the progress. But outside of Vogtle, this franchise, whether we're transitioning the fleet to a low carbon future, whether we're running the business to make it more resilient to extreme weather or attacks in the cyber and physical realm to preserve our national security, we are doing great. And we will continue to do great. And so, we're making progress on all of those functional front. Last thing, I'll just mention, when I think about our D&I efforts, when I think about diversity, and when I think about the improvements of culture - we mentioned to bringing Southern Company gas into the fold. I guess, bringing AGL in the fold now - Southern coming in - we have crossed populated Southern Company Gas now run by Kim Greene. Drew Evans is over here being CFO at Southern. The cross population, the learnings has strengthened our culture and increased, if you will, our cultural bandwidth. This company is better off in the long run for all of these efforts. And I think now when we've renewed our efforts on diversity and inclusion, we'll be even better. So, thank you, exciting day today, and look forward to talking with you in the future. Thanks everyone for listening. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company's second quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Myra, (ph) and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's third quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure, are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor. southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the Third Quarter. The economies in our service territories continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. And in particular, customer growth continues to exceed our expectations. Given results through September, we expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be above the top end of our guidance range. Dan will share more on this in a moment. So let's begin with an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 2 weeks ago, we updated our expected completion timeline for both units, extending the in-service dates by 3 months. For Unit 3, following the completion of hot functional testing, we completed walk down of the 158 safety-related rooms within the nuclear island to assess the extent of remediation work required, consistent with the electrical installation quality issues we highlighted earlier this year, The number of instances of items needing remediation found during our full assessment process, however, exceeded our estimate from July. The change in the Unit 3 schedule into the third quarter of 2022 is primarily a function of the time needed to address the full scope of the remaining remediation work and to account for the impacts on productivity resulting from higher than expected attrition and slower than expected on-boarding of new electricians, field engineers, and supervisors. For Unit 4, recent progress has slowed. that's craft labor, and support resources have been temporarily shifted to support Unit 3's concert -- completion efforts. Considering this decrease in available resources over the next several months, plus recent productivity trends, we now expect Unit 4 in-service during the second quarter of 2023. Importantly, with the corrective actions beside is implemented after discovery of the Unit 3 quality issues, including reinforcement of the importance of first time quality with craft personnel, and improvements to the application of Bechtel's quality program. we believe that as we turn systems over on Unit 4, the amount of remediation work required will be less than what we experienced on Unit 3. During the third quarter, consistent with the surrounding areas, the site experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases that approached the peak of cases we experienced early in 2021. While the availability of vaccines and well-established protocols helped preclude the same degree of disruption experienced during the first wave of COVID-19, the pandemic was certainly a contributing factor to overall productivity and resource availability. For Unit 3, repairs to the spent fuel pool, system turnovers and ITAAC submittals continued throughout the third quarter. Repairs to the spent fuel pool are now complete. And the next major milestone for Unit 3 will be the receipt of the 103 G letter from the NRC. To-date, 242 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC with 156 remaining. On Slide 7 of today's earnings call deck, we have included a forecast of the remaining ITAAC submittals required to support a projected May 2022 fuel load and third quarter 2022 projected in service date. Now, considering our recent volume of ITAAC of metals in October, and the expected completion and turnover of significant systems in the months ahead, the site is targeting ITAAC completion earlier than what is indicated in this forecast, which would provide margin to Unit 3's remaining schedule. We expect to use the time between ITAAC completion and fuel load to finalize the non-safety-related elements of the plant, and to complete any remaining pre -fuel load testing. Turning now to Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 89% complete. A revised projected in service date of the second quarter 2023, reflects the temporary shift of services to Unit 3. Recent productivity trends on bulk electrical work and ongoing efforts to add craft labor and non-manual field support resources in support of first-time quality and productivity. Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month since the start of the year. To achieve a second quarter 2023 in service date, we estimate that Unit 4 we'd need to average approximately 1%, construction completion per month through the end of 2022. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast, increased by $264 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, productivity consistent with recent trends, the cost of additional resources to complete the full score for remaining work with necessary focus on quality and the replenishment of contingency. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $197 million during the third quarter. We remain committed to the credit quality of Georgia Power and Southern Company, And we will continue to seek, to maintain strong credit metrics for both entities. Our priority is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We're committed to taking the time to get it right. And we will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet schedule. At Unit 3, we are working to submit remaining ITAAC to support receipt of the 103 G letter prior to fuel load and commercial operations in 2022. For Unit 4, we remain focused on attracting and retaining necessary craft, labor, and support resources, as well as first-time quality as we work to increase productivity and progress towards the start of open vessel testing, which is now projected by the second quarter of 2022. Dan, I will turn the call over now to you for an update on the financial. Drew Evans : Thanks, Tom. And good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials, we released this morning, all of our major subsidiaries had a solid quarter and our adjusted consolidated earnings are trending extremely well through the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported earnings per share of a $1.23 on an adjusted basis, $0.01 higher than both our estimate for the quarter and our adjusted third quarter of 2020 earnings per share. For the 9 months ended September 30th, 2021, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 compared with adjusted earnings-per-share of $2.78 for the same period in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and earnings package. Major drivers for our adjusted earnings results for the third quarter of 2021 included higher retail kilowatt hour sales at our state regulated utilities, as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic, strong customer growth and impacts of several constructive regulatory outcomes, partially offsetting these impacts, non-fuel O&M reflects the trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to 2020 milder than normal summer temperatures in the Southeast also negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02 compared to our estimate and by $0.07 compared to the third quarter of 2020. Turning now to customer growth through September, we have added over 40,000 new residential electric customers and over 20,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities. This level of customer growth has exceeded our forecast year-to-date and puts us on track to surpass last year's customer growth levels, which were also above historical norms. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery, which is on track to reach pre -pandemic levels of employment in our Southeast service territory next year. For the third quarter, weather-adjusted retail electric sales were up 3% compared to last year and were in line with our expectations. Residential sales remained higher than expected due to extended remote work practices and commercial sales showed continued improvement coming in slightly better than our forecast. Industrial electricity usage lagged other customer groups, primarily driven by production cuts from a single large customer in the chemical segment [Indiscernible] this customer specific event, industrial sales have been in line with our forecast for the quarter. We continue to analyze retail sales and an aggregate through the third quarter our retail sales have essentially recovered to 2019 pre -pandemic levels. We are encouraged by these positive signals while we also continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 variant, supply chain constraints, and labor force participation. The economic development pipeline in Southeast remains robust. Job announcements and business investment in Georgia in the third quarter 2021 were higher than pre -pandemic levels for 2019 and the average of 5 years ending 2020. In Georgia alone, there are currently over 200 active projects with the potential to bring in nearly 40,000 jobs and $13 billion in capital investment in the coming years. Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2021 with adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.05, we expect to achieve adjusted full-year earnings above the top end of our guidance range of $3.35 per share. Our estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.35 per share, which implies an estimated full-year results of $3.40 on an adjusted basis. Before turning the call back over to Tom, I'd like to follow-up briefly on Tom's update on BOPIS 3 and 4. First, I want to reiterate our commitment to credit quality, which has been constant. In our last call, we reinforced that commitment by announcing we would turn on our dividend reinvestment plans in the near future. As we have done so well over the last several years, we also continue to evaluate opportunities for asset sales. Within a portfolio the size of Southern Company, we have several investments which warrant continuous review for whether or not a better owner exists. Whether such potential transactions serve to offset our near-term equity needs or ultimately fund our long-term capital investment plans, we will remain disciplined to the benefit of equity holders and bond holders alike, as we execute our financing plans. And finally, let me briefly highlight the Vogtle Units 3 rate adjustments, stipulation that was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission on Tuesday. consistent with the framework the PSC established with our order for the 17th VCM Process. This most recent order allows $2.1 billion of investment in Vogtle Unit 3 and the Vogtle Units, 3 and 4 common facilities to be moved from the Nuclear Construction Cost Recovery tariff or NCCR, into retail rate base the month after Unit 3 goes into service, where it will learn Georgia Power 's full allowed rate of return. Additionally, Georgia Power will be allowed to recover the related operating expenses and depreciation on this portion of Unit 3, which is an important credit supportive aspect of the stipulation. The entire process which struck an appropriate balance for all stakeholders, was a great affirmation of the constructive Georgia regulatory environment. Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks Dan. Let me wrap up with an update on the Southeastern Energy Exchange Market or SEEM and our fleet transition Subject to resolution of any rehearing request, SEEM is moving forward after clearing the approval process. SEEM is region-wide automated into our platform, consisting of nearly 20 entities across 11 states, with the goal of more efficient bilateral trading in the Southeast. It is not an energy imbalance market or an RTO Benefiting from robust integrated planning by the individual states, municipalities, and utilities, the region represented by SEEM members scores very favorably on all important metrics compared to the RTOs across the country. SEEM will improve electric service to customers in the Southeast, a reason that is already an industry leader for customer satisfaction and reliability. The members of SEEM electricity market also provide low retail prices for residential and business customers using a mix of carbon-free energy resources similar to the rest of the country. We believe SEEM is good for our customers, and we're excited to be a part of this new platform, which is expected to launch in mid 2022. Turning now to our fleet transition. In our most recent climate report named Implementation and Action Towards Net 0, we reaffirmed our long-term goal of achieving net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As an important step in the transition of our fleet, earlier this month Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed plans with their respective state environmental authorities detailing how each would comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Effluent Limitation Guidelines. With these expected changes and the recent retirement announcement of two coal units at Mississippi Power's plant, Daniel, since 2007, Southern Company will have announced total decreases in its coal-generating capacity from more than 20,000 megawatts, across nearly 70 generating unit to less than 4,500 megawatts of coal capacity, remaining at 8 generating units. This equates to a reduction of nearly 80%. The final resolution for many of the actions outlined in the [Indiscernible] compliance filings, including the exact timing of retirements and any other actions we may recommend remains subject to the approval of our state public service commissions through the integrated resource planning processes or IRP. These proceedings are intended to comprehensively address transmission and generation resource needs over the long term, which could include additional decisions regarding the future of the remaining coal unit. As always, part of our planning process for transitioning these units will include placing a high priority on protecting the interest of our employees and the communities we are privileged to serve. The transition of our generating fleet and the important regulatory proceedings that will play out over the next 9 months, will significantly inform our capital investment opportunities. As we always do, we will update our capital investment plans during our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, which will include known fleet transition opportunities. It is likely that further transparency on our long-term capital plan will unfold through out 2022 and we will update our forecasts as appropriately. Importantly, our current 2024 earnings-per-share base of $4 to $4.30 is based upon our current 5-year capital plan with potential incremental investments, providing the opportunity to strengthen our position, both within that 2024 range and within our 5 to 7% long-term growth range. Now, before we move to the Q&A portion which we always love here, this just came across the wires. Next week is Veterans Day and a publication that I'm sure you all know well, Military Times, came out with their Best for Vets ranking of employers. And we've typically been on the list that shows the top 15 companies across America and it include well-known companies like Bank of America, Booz Allen Hamilton, The Hilton Group, Johnson & Johnson and others. They just have named Southern Company the number 1 Company in America that's best for vets. That included evaluations of recruiting practices, retention, and support programs and a higher emphasis on employers who provide assistance and flexibility for individuals and the guard and reserves. We certainly respect the contribution that these folks make. They are a significant part of our employment base, I think amounting to over 11% of employee today. We respect their service and we want to make sure that they have the best work environment that they could have. We are honored beyond belief to be named the number 1 Company in America, Best for Vets, as named by the Military Times. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. You will hear a 3-tone prompt to acknowledge your request. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please for our first question. Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with, Guggenheim. Please, go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hey guys. Drew Evans : Hello Shar, thanks for joining. Shar Pourreza : Excellent. Dan nice to hear your voice. But just a couple of quick questions here. Tom, a lot of investors are hoping to hear more about your [Indiscernible] capex opportunities at EEI next week, especially kind of with your Georgia and Alabama IRP next year. Can you remind us of some of the types and size of the incremental capex we could see when you roll the capex plans forward next February. Maybe offer some ballpark figures to help frame the opportunity set as you shut down coal, how you'll finance it, what the impact the rates could be, I mean I understand things will shift between now and then, but any comment would be great. Tom Fanning : Yeah. Sure. I hate to disappoint you. We're not going to say very much next week. Suffice to say that beat plan and to approve by the public service commissions will have an impact on capex. We always provide that update in our call. I guess it will be the end of January or early February, about our fourth quarter results and total year results. So we will certainly do that then. I think as I said, to the extent there are impacts, the current capital forecast formulated our range in 2022, $4 to $4.30. To the extent there is an increase in capex, certainly that strengthens our place within that range and the longer term, 5% to 7% growth rate. The other thing that we should remember about rates is that as you retire coal, you free up a whole lot of O&M. We intend to use that O&M to basically, allow for cost recovery, account for the incremental revenue requirements associated with new generation that will replace that and keep rates as low as possible for our customers. Drew Evans : And so just a reminder what Tom such as prepared remarks is the $4 -- $4 to $4.30 on 2024 is predicated on our current capex plan. And I think the way to think about these incremental opportunities as it will potentially increase or intensify, overcome. I mean, you said postpone growth. I think that is the point in time when we really begin to see tangible long-term increases to that profile from $8 billion a year to something more. Tom Fanning : And one last point there, one of the benefits of our integrated resource planning processes, is we get to optimize portfolios, not only on generation, but also transmission. So transmission could be a benefit there. The other one you should keep in mind is we currently -- we said this in other calls. We currently allow for about 500 million a year of cap allocation to things like Southern Power. None of those allocations are included in our forecast. And it would stand to reason that as the U.S. transitions its generating fleet, there will be more opportunities for Southern Power in that regard. Drew Evans : And just on the transmission Shar and the reason we're being a little hesitant to share too early, well, there's transmission opportunities associated with what we will retire. The other transmission opportunities come about with what we replaced that with and where, and that is simply a function of our integrated planning processes and we just need to let those play off. Tom Fanning : But it's a good thing for us. Good thing for our customers we get to iterate around those choices. You don't get that opportunity in the organized markets. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Thank you for that and I know lastly for me, I know there's a lot of focus on exactly which month in the three will be in service next year, but I'm a little bit more interested, on what happens once it's online. So once you get three comes online, how should we think about what that means for earnings and cash flows in light of the TSC proven that joint settlement with the staff this required I know there's a lot of moving parts with the NCCR AFDC. The penalty ROE, but just really at a high level, what are the immediate impacts to cash flows and earnings following Unit 3 reaching the service. Thanks guys. Tom Fanning : Yes, absolutely. So let's just make the assumption for the sake of describing all this chart that the third quarter means September of 2022. So given the results at the Georgia Public Service Commission earlier this week, that will mean that rates will go into place for $2.1 billion of Unit 3 in the comm facilities, earning Georgia Power's full cost of capital. If you think about it, relative to what we're earning today, that's going to add about a third of a sense of EPS for every month, for October, November, and December relative to what you would have forecasted under current conditions it's about a third of a penny per month. The Drew Evans : Important thing is that $2.1 billion is not the full cost of Unit 3 and the common facilities, what remains will remain earning a return under NCCR, or will be deferred for future recovery with the Commission. And at the same time, we will be recovering currently, the operating costs of Unit 3 and the depreciation, at least the associated with a $2.1 billion. Shar Pourreza : Got it. That was super helpful. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the great execution. Drew Evans : Thanks, Sir. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey Julien, how are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: A quite well thanks, Tom. Pleasure, clinical team congrats Dan to o. Let's just dive right in on the asset sale for the year. You obviously made some pretty interesting comments some moment ago. Just wanted to clarify there is you think about regulated versus perhaps some of the other assets you own that Southern Power or otherwise, what exactly are you thinking about there and then more importantly, what equity need are you kind of thinking about here? Obviously, it's not -- it doesn't seem as least as explicitly stated to substantive here. But can you talk about how you're thinking about equity needs, especially considering some of the prospective capex you alluded to. I expect that feeds into this commentary on asset sales to. Tom Fanning : Yes, sure. As always, Dan speak to the equity needs. I'll go back to the litany on M&A that I always do. I think we've demonstrated in the past whether we're buying or selling, that we always seek to put assets with the best owner. Our formulation for that is the old rubric, value is a function of risk and return. And so we have ideas right now, we really don't want to front run in the public what those ideas are, about assets where there may be better owners. We'll see whether they come to fruition or not. Certainly as they do, we will keep you updated, but we are looking over our list of things and we'll see. Dan, you want to speak to the equity needs? Drew Evans : Yes absolutely. So Julien, essentially, what we're addressing is only the impact of the recent Vogtle cost increases. So to the extent that that has an impact on our credit profile, we're committed to mitigating that. Whether that's turning our drip on or finding opportunities with these asset sales. Beyond that, we still see a long-term plan, even in light of the incremental capex opportunities that we're alluding to where we don't need incremental equity. I think it's important to point towards a post Vogtle kind of forecast period. And our credit metrics out there are about 200 basis points for FFO to debt higher than they are today. And that's a position of strength for us and gives us a lot of flexibility as to how we finance our group. And I just want to clarify, just back on source question that I said 1/3 of a cent per month. It's 2/3 of a cent per month, I just want make sure that's clear. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: 2/3 a cent. Drew Evans : Yeah. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Tom Fanning : Okay. Yeah. And to be very clear to o, I'm trying to be less elliptical on what we're looking at. But you should assume, as we have moved here to be, what is it, 95% of our earnings are integrated regulated kind of earnings that it would contribute to that profile. In other words, we're not going to buy ourselves things which make ourselves more risky. I think we love the idea of reasonable turn and low risk. And also as you have seen in the past years or since I've been here. As we have bought say for example, AGL Resources now Southern Company Gas, there had been things around the edges that have allowed us to simplify and de -risk our business. So think about those things and we'll see how it goes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And then just coming back to Unit floor, obviously, you made some comments a moment ago about some of the labor availability, etc. and remediation work. I mean, how do you get comfortable with the nine month time gap between those two units in service date. But I'm just calling out that staffing stated at to various points about sort of the concerns that they have, on the second unit and service. Tom Fanning : Yeah. Julian. Yes. Thanks for that. It's an important point to raise as has the ties at both ebbs and flows here. Let me explain that a little bit. We believe that Bechtel has had the responsibility to attract skilled personnel, skilled craftwork, especially electrician engineers, to assess the work that's being done and field site personnel, supervisory personnel to oversee the work that's going on. We have not kept pace with the requirements to advance these units in terms of attracting the people, and you named the reason why we've had more attrition. I think certainly the amount of attrition is potentially associated with the COVID response and everything else. So we've had to do a couple of different things. We have said in the past that we were moving to de -link the progress at Unit 4 from Unit 3. And so therefore, this 12-month margin didn't matter. One of the way that we serve to continue to advance Unit 3, was again to borrow personnel from Unit 4. So we didn't really want to do that, but it was a necessary move to continue to advance the work at Unit 3. Now, as we finish that work, we will send those people back to Unit four. And once again, they will be de -linked. But for the period of time in which we have borrowed personnel from 4 to 3, a delay in 3 means a delay in 4. And so that has happened. The other thing that we have done is to augment back fills, sourcing efforts with our own efforts. We've had a very deep engineering and construction services group in Birmingham, our own resources that we could attract personnel and so we have significantly augmented Bechtel's efforts to increase the flow of people necessary to promote skilled labor, electricians and field supervisory personnel. All of those things are in progress. All of those things are consistent with the new schedules we've given you. And I will say one more thing. There was a lot of conversation about this. I can tell you, Chris Womack and I in particular, we're really watching the trends. If I just looked at current data, we still have margin 6 weeks or so to Unit 3, 3 months or so to Unit 4 on the existing not extended schedules. We looked at the trends, however, and the trends to me we're troubling. And so we all kind of step back and said, I would rather take the conservative posture of evaluating these trends and adding more time, because frankly we didn't believe that we had 6 months of scheduled margin left on 3, and 3 months of scheduled margin left on 4. And we could've quibble on adding a month or 2 months. We said, let's go ahead and add a quarter for both. And that's where we came out on this decision. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So it's not so much the 9 months necessarily. It's that you're adding a quarter of both of those latitude with in both schedule. If I'm hearing you right. Tom Fanning : Yeah. And this idea of there's got to be 12 months, they're in fact -- the only time they are linked is when we borrowed from 4 to 3. Therefore, a delay in 3 causes a delay in 4. Once we get 3 back into its place, then we are able to send the people back to 4 and again, they are de -linked. The 9 month difference between the 2 does not trouble us. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you guys. Best of luck. Hear from me soon me. Tom Fanning : Thanks. Appreciate you calling in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Great. Good afternoon, Tom. Likewise. Dan, nice to have you CFO. So just first on the maybe Tom just on the Vogtle schedule. I know you don't want to speak for staff the commission, but just with this latest update in the way that you're giving schedules now, is there a better chance that, they'll match up closer to what you are saying when they come out in a few weeks on this or should we be prepared for something that's again different than what you're saying. Tom Fanning : Yes. Steve, you kind of gave me the answer before I answered and that is I don't want to speak for staff. Dr. Jacob is a guy that I know well. He attends the same meetings we attend, he sees the same stuff we see. He's a really bright guy. I think if I had to highlight something that will come under some discussion and I think it's absolutely correct, you want to look at schedule variability at this point. We believe we see a pretty clear track to receiving the 103 G letter, which allows us to load nuclear fuel, allows us to go hot on the site. There is a certain amount of work that will occur between the receipt of the letter and the actual loading of nuclear fuel. In my opinion, that work that is from 103G receipt to loading the fuel is probably the remaining biggest risk to schedule that remains on Unit 3. Recall in the script, we talked about finding more remediation. And I know in some other media, we've talked about these items. None of them being deal killers and all and stuff, but there's no such thing as a little issue in nuclear. Everything we take seriously. Everything must be done effectively with perfection. And so it is that time that we're looking at right now that I would say to you is probably the shared view of Dr. Jacobs in particular and us, as the biggest risk to schedule that remain, right now, our assessment of that work, if we get the 103 g letter early let's say January, then I'm going to guess, and this is just a guess on my part, so don't hold me to it. But I'm going to guess there maybe six weeks of work left from receipt of the letter to the actual loading of the fuel. If the 103 G letter is delayed, then that 6 weeks reduces because this is work that can be done in parallel with, some of the other stuff that's required to get 103 G. Remember we've talked about 3 buckets of work that we identified post HFT. One bucket deals with the issues we identified during a hot functional test. The second deals with remediation that frankly has increased since we passed the 103 G letter and really was subsequent to the July call we had with you guys. The last bucket really dealt with human performance systems, HVAC, signage a variety of other things. That work margin is bigger, let me just say it again. If we get received a 103 G early let's say at January I mean who knows. It could be as much as 6 weeks. If we get 103 G later, that work time will shrink to 2 weeks or something. We'll see. See that's where I think you will see a lot of discussion between us and the commission. Drew Evans : Let me just add real quickly to Tom's comments. The nature of the risk for that work Coast 103G up to fuel load is really logistics. So once we receive 103G, the site becomes an operating nuclear site. So the logistics of getting people to ingress and egress a personnel to do the remaining work is just friction on productivity and that's really the nature of that risk. Tom Fanning : That was helpful. Steve Fleishman : Clear that was very helpful. And Dan going back to the question before about trying to kind of size the potential equity needs or asset sale, target need. You said just look at the what's the cost increases have been is that it's a simple as that or are you targeting any different metrics as well? And then you had prior to that? Drew Evans : Yes. Look, Steve, if you want to make an assumption in your model that our opportunity to do that is the size of the after-tax write-offs, that's a reasonable assumption. That said, we're looking across multiple opportunities. We will see what that looks like. More importantly, from a long-term perspective, that uplift in the credit metrics that we talked about is really what is key. We always take a long-term view on this stuff and I'm very comfortable with how we're positioned long term and there's not a need for anything or significant than those near-term charges that we've taken to earn. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And you haven't -- Tom Fanning : Go ahead, Steve. Go ahead. Steve Fleishman : No, I'm just -- you haven't given a number on what the DRIP equity that you said you turn the DRIP on. Did you -- Drew Evans : We have. Yes, we have. So we've not turned it on, we're holding that as an option to see what, if anything, becomes of any asset sale opportunities and we'll do one or the other. The DRIP on an annual basis equals about $400 million worth of equity. Tom Fanning : And you're in a prior call you kind of said was we thought the drip and one year without the last issue. This is another roughly $200 million. So let's see what the review of our asset sales are, and we'll figure out where we go on the issuance of new shares under the drip. Please assure if we can find a better solution than issuing shares under the drip will do it. Steve Fleishman : Right. And I guess to degree that there might be some, incremental growth opportunities in the Capital plan as you go through IRP transition, etc., asset sales could help fund that part too. Tom Fanning : Yes. I think good and as Dan indicated from -- if you look at the capex forecast, most likely the capex opportunity associated with the transition of the fleet will occur in the back part of that capex forecast. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Where our credit metrics will be [Indiscernible] Okay. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey Jeremy, how are you? Jeremy Tonet : Good, Thanks for having me. Just wanted to come back to Vogtle. If I could here. Just wanted to see if you could provide some incremental color on labor market impacts here and just as I'm thinking, how much just costs go up per month delayed at this point, just this prior increased seems a bit larger then I would've thought. Drew Evans : Jeremy the way to think about it, this is really been what has occurred both in the Second quarter and this most recent announcement here in the third quarter, the cost increases has really been a function of two things. One is the schedule itself, and that's kind of that notion of hotel load that we talked about. And for Unit 3, that is $35 million a month I believe and for Unit 4, $25 million a month and $15 million a month for Unit 4. So for every month reaching if that's just the infrastructure that supports construction in the cost of that. With this most recent increase and again, much like the second quarter increase, it also came with new assumptions on the number of personnel necessary to complete the work, and so that's where that incremental cost is coming from both increases really represented about, half pure schedule or hotel costs. And then the other half, personnel and productivity assumptions to complete the work. Tom Fanning : Yes. And I would be remiss if we didn't had the idea that in sourcing all of these personnel in the skilled labor. Sean McGarvey and his team at the building trades has been fabulous. The IBEW in particular has been great, they've given us tremendous ongoing support. And I think our relationship with them is really bearing fruit here as we augment that builds efforts. Jeremy Tonet : Got it, that's helpful. Thank you for that. And maybe just shifting towards the DC for a minute here if I could. Obviously, things are fluid here, but just want to see as things stand right now, what are your biggest takeaways from the federal infrastructure legislation? And when thinking about minimum taxes, well, I guess how do you think some of the gives and takes as it relates to Southern? Tom Fanning : Jeremy calling the situation in Washington, fluid is a bit like calling the Grand Canyon a crack. I will say this, that there's lots of good stuff in the infrastructure bill and in the reconciliation bill that help us. They are shaped mostly as incentives. And we think that incentives are the way to go. We're particularly interested in anything that as we go through this transition of the fleet and transmission to a net 0 future that we keep prices as low as possible, To help our energy resource in a worldwide competitive market to keep it -- to keep America in a very strong position to compete for new loads and manufacturing and a variety of other things, it is important for the nation. It is important for our customers to keep prices low and to provide incentives to do that, that's kind of thing 1. Thing 2, Dan can correct me here or whatever, but we've looked at this minimum tax proposal. And we think it doesn't have that much of an impact to us maybe it bounces around from a year-to-year as you would expect, but it kind of averages 1%. Drew Evans : That's right, Tom. Tom Fanning : So don't have much of an impact us. I'm sure it would for others that rely on tax benefits to drive their earnings. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. I just wanna say, A. Thank you for taking the question. B. Dan congratulations. Another kind of being talented person in the CFO seat and your large Company have always with lots going on and kudos well-deserved. Next year in Georgia, and I'm just trying to think about the regulatory calendar in the series of events and more, how they intertwine or if they intertwine. So you'll go through the IRP process. I forget if the IRP actually gets formal approval or not. But you've also -- I think still have a rate case. And then will you also file to get Unit 4 in service if it looks like similar to how you did with Unit 3 to go ahead and set what the revenue requirement would be. Tom Fanning : So Michael, there is a laundry list of things going on next year. We're certainly taking all of that into account. If you look at history. The Georgia Power Company with its relationship with the PSC itself, and what the work load at the staff, I think we've always managed to find our way to get big things done. And we just look forward to that constructive relationship going forward, I think the recent settlement agreement we reached on the stuff we just mentioned in the script was evidenced of that continued good working relationships. There is a lot going on next year with VCM, with IRP, with Vogtle 3, with potential prudency earnings beginning on the fuel load of 4 with a rate case filing. So there's a lot to work through. Just to understand that as we have in the past, we'll work with the folks involved to do it in the right way. Michael Lapides : Got it. My other question and I saw a little news splash. For the past week or so about you're buying a plant from AI infrastructure private equity owner to serve. I think it was for Alabama Power. Just curious, when you look around do you see significant opportunities for kind of plant M&A to bring them into rate base versus going through the construction process? Tom Fanning : Yes, we do. And we keep those things, just as we're talking about buying and selling and we want to kind of keep our kimono closed at this point, as we see those opportunities we'll certainly work on them. That's just another evidence of something. The other kind of good thing about buying used assets that way. As you think about transitioning the fleet, I think I've said this in the past, to get to 0 for us we're going to have a profile in the 2040 to 2050 that will look something like 50% renewables, maybe 20% nuclear, maybe 25% natural gas. A lot of that natural gas will have CCS on it. The tail end of that, the 5% remaining could be something different. It could be hydrogen, it could be a variety of other thing. Hydrogen doesn't appear to be all that viable until maybe in the 30s. You do know that the Plant Alabama is building has the capability to blend hydrogen into its fuel mix. So you may see hydrogen occur in an indirect sort of way prior to the 40s and 50. But anyway, my sense is that you're going to have a lot of opportunity to buy some natural gas. The good thing about buying used units is, they may have a remaining life of 10 to 15 years, that fits in with retirement schedules that are consistent with adding more renewables. So those assets look like bridging assets. and very attractive economically and important to our strategy of replacing it with renewables. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Tom much appreciated. Tom Fanning : You bet. Always good talking with you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Mizuho, please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Pleasure to have you with us. Paul Flemont : Thank you so much. You've talked a little bit about that you still have construction work remaining on the plant. Can you give us a time-frame that it's going to take for you to complete the construction and if you want to sort of separate out the third bucket that you think you can do, after you get the letter. You can do it either with or without that bucket. Tom Fanning : Paul, maybe I'm not following your question. Could you, try that again? Paul Flemont : In terms of days or months, how much -- how much physical construction work do you have yet, remaining on Unit 3? Tom Fanning : Okay. So in general, what I indicated was here we are in nearly the middle of November. Okay. So in order to hit January, 103G. So that's 2 months round numbers. Okay. And then I would say if we had 103G in hand in January. My best guess right now is there maybe another 6 weeks of construction. So let's just think about that, 2 months plus 6 weeks is 3.5 months. Okay. That's a broad estimate. Paul Flemont : Okay. But obviously -- Tom Fanning : Hey, excuse me, Paul. And we certainly have allowed more time than that in the revised schedule. Remember, we added 3 months to all of that. Paul Flemont : Okay. Right. Tom Fanning : That's my answer to your question. Paul Flemont : Okay. So you believe you have 6 weeks of physical work still to go? And then -- Tom Fanning : Well, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, Paul. It's -- what I would say is 6 weeks of physical work to get to 103G. It may be that it takes 8 weeks. I mean, who knows? But that's just a reasonable guess. So middle of November, wait a minute, I said 2 months. Middle of November to middle of January as 2 months. And then you would say add-on some more time to get to fuel load, right? That was a response to, I think it was Fleishman. So between 103G and fuel load, there is more work to be done. And I estimated that at its maximum, say 6 weeks. And at it's minimum, that's assuming we have a delay on 103G of 2 weeks, something like that. So to say, what I say, 3 or 4 months. Am I am I answering your question there? Drew Evans : Paul, let me -- Paul Flemont : 2 months plus another either 6 weeks or 3 weeks, depending on where you are. Tom Fanning : if it were less than 6 weeks, but Paul, remember, as I said, was if it was less than 6 weeks, that presumes that there is a delay in getting 103G. The total amount of time is, let's just say 3 to 4 months Drew Evans : And Paul just stated a different way with our September assumption for in-service of third quarter. of 2022, then work could continue through April with a 103G receipt fuel load in May, and then in-servicing system. Paul Flemont : And then can you tell us where you are relative to turnover and testing? I think there were 159 systems for each of the plants that need to go through turnover and testing. I think the last update, you were roughly at 120 on Unit 3. But is there any update on where you are now on Unit 3 and Unit 4? Tom Fanning : So let's think about it. We have now completed -- so there was 158 walk-through to go through. We've completed them all now. Let's start there. We think there's about, let's see, 100,000 hours or so direct construction. We have in terms of systems, I forget how many we started with, but around 17 left to go. In between the July call and now, we turned over 11. And so it's interesting to look at is the symmetry of that even though I think we're probably closer. If in 3 months we turned over 11, 17 to go I just said 3 to 4 months, that's a little inaccurate because all the systems are being worked on and we're getting closer to complete all the systems. So there's probably a little bit less than that. In order to get to 103G. We need the completion of eight system turnovers. We have 7 to get to fuel load. So that's the delta between 103G and fuel load. And I said, that can expand and contract, how we think about that. Those seven are being Don and parallel, with the 8 required to get 100 3G. So those are not sequential, they are parallel. And then even after a fuel load, there are some things that will continue to be worked on. I think there's like two systems that you can do even after fuel load. So let me just say that again. Of the 17 systems that remain to turnover, 8 are required to get 103G, 7 are required to get to fuel load, 2 can be continued to be worked on even after fuel load. Paul Flemont : So I'm gathering from what you're saying. In the past, I think you've needed to get all of your I-tax approved by the NRC before you get the 103G letter. I'm gathering here, are you guys asking for the NRC to give you different treatment where you would get the 103G letter before all of -- Tom Fanning : No. This is all consistent with everything we've ever done with the NRC and 103 G, everything is consistent. Paul Flemont : In other words, all the ITAAC s would need to be approved, but I would assume that not all, but you would still have systems that would be untested. So those are systems that don't require ITAAC approvals, I take it. Tom Fanning : Yes. In order to get permission to load fuel, so the systems after permission to load fuel are not necessarily safety-related items. They could be somebody's signage issues or something like that. Anything that is required to get 103G is encapsulated in the eight systems I mentioned. Before, we load fuel, we still want to do 7, 2 of those -- not 2 of those in additional 2 can be done even after we load fuel. They're just not safety-related construction items. Paul Flemont : And then my last question, I'm sorry. Drew Evans : Just want to clarify, Paul. In our materials when it does relate to I-tax, we provided a schedule of an i-tech completion cadence that would support in April 103G, May fuel load, September end service. What you'll note is that there's nothing showing in November because nowhere to support that schedule, we don't need any November Our expectation is they're absolutely will be some in November. In fact, I believe we've already submitted 2 since the month has begun, so everyone in November that gets completed reduces the number that need to be completed between December and April to support of 103G. Tom Fanning : I'm sure you guys know Aaron Abramovitz. He was Chief Financial Officer of the project. He was actually located on-site. Now he's the CFO with Georgia Tower. In order to give you the schedule that you saw in your package, effectively what he did, he started with September in service date. We believe we have margin to that. But he started with September in-service. And then he reverse engineered back in a conservative way to say, well this would be the ITAAC completion schedule consistent with September. We believe we have margin to that. As we get ITAAC s filed in November, I'll go ahead and say we expect to get about 20. Well this one the schedule we gave you indicates nothing in November and not much work in December. When we think we'll have that exceeded by a pretty good margin. And so we'll be ahead of the schedule. Well, that just suggests our belief that in fact there is margin to the schedule we're giving you now. And the other thing Greg was important in that, the reason why we went to all this trouble was we thought you guys would want to have a way to measure our progress. And hitting 103G and ultimately fuel load and we thought this was kind of a good way to measure our progress. So look and see how many I've tax we file in November and December and compared to the schedule and I think you'll see that. I think we'll beat the schedule pretty handily at least early on for sure. Paul Flemont : And then last question, where are you currently in the cost sharing, Dan, as it relates to you and your partners in the plant? Are you now at a point where you're picking up a 100% of the incremental project costs? Drew Evans : We believe we have not entered that We certainly have some discussion among us and the other co-owners about that. I think we've disclosed that and I'd rather not go too far into that and I just appreciate your patience with us there. Just as we don't front run regulatory process as we have a long track record of not doing that, it's best for us to have the resolution of those differences of opinion done in private. Tom Fanning : But just very matter of fact, with Paul as we disclosed our calculation to just we're not even into the first end for sure. Paul Flemont : Great. That's it for me. Thank you so much Tom Fanning : Paul your great. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hello Sophie, how are you? Sophie Karp : I'm good. Thank you for taking my questions. How are you? Tom Fanning : You bet. Sophie Karp : All right. Just a little quick one. Do you expect to have any kind of incremental labor issues as a result of the OSHA rule regarding the COVID vaccination mandate sort of kicks in. Fair to assume, I think and just any thoughts, I appreciate it given your way before this vaccination rates. Tom Fanning : Yes, Ma'am. You know, we always have the health and safety of our employees foremost in our minds. And I think if you look at the way we've handled the site through the epidemic, I think it's been amazing. The accomplishments that those folks have done even under restricted protocols. We were just on a call here as we just gotten more granularity, I guess from OSHA, about what their expectations are. It's 400 pages long. We're kind of diving through it. We know there are legal challenges to come. It's really too early for us to say right now what we think the impacts will be. I know even EEI has requested a 90-day delay. Look, there's a lot to digest right now. Let's keep our eyes on that. And just as a final thought, you folks know that I've been leading the ESCC, electricity sub-sector coordinating counsel. And I know the deals are cyber and physical threats. It also deals with the industry's response to major storms. We call those national response events. And so I've kind of helped organize the national response to a hurricane or a snow storm, or what have you. Clearly as you introduce new operating requirements into those gigantic magnitude events, we got to make sure that we serve the interest of customers, and not only get the wires up and the plants running, but restore hope to the communities we're privileged to serve. We don't want to let any of these new requirements interfere with our ability to serve the American economy during those times. So all of those conversations are going on right now. And Sophie, I wish I could give you more granular stuff, but it's all just very timely conversation we're working through. I'm very confident by our next earnings call we'll have more to stay there. Sophie Karp : Got it. Thank you for the comments, I appreciate it. That's all for me. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Hey, Paul. Great to have you with us. Paul? We would still be great to have you with us. I don't know where he is. Operator : Mr. Patterson, your line is open. Please check your mute button or lift your handset. It appears we're unable to hear you. Please, you will register for your question. If you'd like to ask your question. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Just to say thank you. I'm I get frustrated at times. I know you guys may get frustrated also, this kind of scheduled stuff. But I think what we're doing right now is conservative imprudent. It gives us more margin. We're working very hard. We're making progress. We'll get there. And I want to thank the people at the site for working so hard and making the progress they're making with respect to the challenges of personnel, quality that always remains foremost. And this phrase we used, get it right, is so important to us, we will always work to get it right. So thank you for your for your understanding and all of that. As we move through these issues, we've had good progress. The regulatory constructs that we had on the first 2.1 billion at all, I think was more evidence that I think we do have a constructive working relationship. And that post Vogel, the numbers are essentially irrefutable I mean, I think that cash flow, earnings trajectory, overall financial integrity of the Company, is truly outstanding and we think warrants anyone's interest as an investment. So thank you for your time and we look forward to talking with you next week at EEI. Dan, any closing comments? Drew Evans : No, sir. See everyone at EEI. Tom Fanning : All right. That's all, Operator. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company third quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company\u2019s year-end 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure, are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2021, exceeding both our original 2021 guidance and the estimate that we provided on our third quarter call. This performance is due in no small part to our outstanding service territories and the unparalleled commitment of our employee to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. Our outstanding customer service, our commitment to the communities we serve and our proactive engagement with our stakeholders are reflected in the numerous honors we\u2019ve highlighted in our slide deck, including recent recognition as number two in the nation on Forbes 2022 list of America\u2019s Best Large Employers. Many of the initiatives that support this distinction are reflected in our inaugural transformation report which we released earlier this week. This report details our sustained commitment and actions to further advance equity, both within our company and our communities. These commitments allow Southern Company to help lead change within our communities and provide an enduring reflection of our values. We are proud with the progress we have made and continue to recognize the opportunity to do more. As an example of the work we\u2019re doing to drive our customer satisfaction results, a meaningful portion of our capital plan in recent years has been allocated to the continued modernization of our electric grids. Our grid automation strategies and investments are delivering real value to customers. And in 2021, our customers experienced 15% fewer minutes of interruptions. Similar initiatives will continue to be a major component of our capital plans going forward. Across all of our stakeholder groups, including employees, customers, communities and investors, we\u2019re focused on sustainability and a long-term view of value. That objective remains sound. The long-term financial plan that we outlined for you last year remains intact. And we are reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate expectation, consistent with adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4 to $4.30 in 2024. Let\u2019s now turn to an update regarding some of the recent developments related to our progress on Plant Vogtle units three and four. As you can see in the materials provided earlier today, we updated our expected completion timeline for both units, extending the in-service dates for each unit by three to six months. As we discussed on previous calls, the paper process is a critical aspect of turning plant components and systems over from construction to testing and operations. We have discovered incomplete and missing inspection records concerning much of the materials and equipment that have been installed at Unit 3. These inspection records are an important part of the documentation that is necessary to file ITAACs. Our progress on Unit 3 ITAAC has slowed as we address a backlog of tens of thousands of inspection records needing completion to support system turnovers. Through hard work over the last several weeks, we have reduced this backlog by more than 30%. Documentation within these inspection records is a critical aspect of getting it right and the time and resources to complete the remaining inspection records and remediate construction issues identified in the process, including the impact of borrowing Unit 4 resources are key drivers for the change in schedule. We have 123 ITAACs remaining for Unit 3. The revised ITAAC completion schedule we\u2019ve included in our slide deck is consistent with a three-month change in the Unit 3 schedule. Over the past year, a number of challenges including shortcomings in construction and documentation quality have continued to emerge, adding to project timelines and cost. In recognition of the possibility for new challenges to emerge, we further risk adjusted our current forecast by establishing a range of three to six additional months for each unit. And we\u2019ve reserved for the maximum amount. We continue to make meaningful progress on both units. Notably for Unit 3, all 157 fuel assemblies have been loaded into the spent fuel pool in preparation for fuel load. For Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 92% complete, open vessel testing has started, and we recently completed the structural integrity and integrated leak rate tests without issue. The aforementioned challenges on Unit 3 are serving as lessons learned for Unit 4, and have benefited our performance on Unit 4 to date, relative to Unit 3. First time quality on both construction and documentation are key areas to focus. Our priority is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely on line, and again to get it right, to provide Georgia with a reliable carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. With this most recent change in project costs and schedule, provisions in the Vogtle 3 and 4 co-owner agreement came to the forefront, requiring the owners to affirmatively vote to proceed with the project. Vogtle 3 and 4 is incredibly important to the state of Georgia and its robust growing economy. Furthermore, the addition of 2,000 megawatts of baseload carbon-free energy is vital to increasing the availability of net zero energy resources across the state. Considering the facts and our proximity to commercial operation, Georgia Power has already voted to proceed. The other owners are required to vote by March 8th, which allows time for them to work through their own governance processes. Consistent with the schedule extension of up to six months additional for each unit, Georgia Power\u2019s share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $480 million largely as a function of time, additional resources to complete the remaining work with the unnecessary focus on quality construction and documentation and the replenishment of contingency. We continue working constructively with our co-owners to resolve different interpretations of the cost sharing agreement within expected potential range of outcomes of $100 million to $900 million. We have included $440 million of the $900 million in our total project cost estimates. In aggregate, Georgia Power\u2019s resulting total capital cost forecast is $920 million. And as a result, Georgia Power recorded an after tax charge of $686 million during the fourth quarter. We value our partners on Vogtle 3 and 4 and the relationship we\u2019ve had with them across multiple assets for decades. We look forward to our continued partnership on each new unit as they transition to commercial operation, providing millions of Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity for decades to come. Before turning the call over to Dan for an update on our 2021 financial performance, and our long-term outlook, I\u2019d like to briefly touch on Georgia Power\u2019s triennial Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was filed with the Georgia Public Service Commission late last month. The proposed plan sets forth a proactive, innovative and transformational roadmap for how Georgia Power expects to support customers in its growing service territory for decades to come. Consistent with Southern Company\u2019s path to net zero carbon emissions, the plan describes a tangible path to transition Georgia Power\u2019s generating fleet to cleaner more economical resources. This plan includes retirement of all of the coal units, Georgia Power controls by 2028, except for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4, which are scheduled to be retired no later than 2035. The plan also includes a request for the addition of 6,000 megawatts of renewable generation by 2035, more than doubling Georgia Power\u2019s current renewable resources. Additionally, 1,000 megawatts of storage is requested by 2030 to improve the capacity value of these intermittent resources. In recognition of the changing energy landscape, Georgia Power proposed innovative programs to promote reliability and resilience, including a distributed energy resource program. The comprehensive long-term plan also addresses continued investment in our transmission system and energy efficiency programs for customers. The IRP is subject to the review and approval of the Georgia Public Service Commission. Hearings will take place during the first half of 2021, with a final decision due this summer. Dan, I\u2019ll turn the call over now to you. Please take it away. Dan Tucker : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. All of our major subsidiaries had a strong 2021. As a result, our full year adjusted earnings were $3.41 per share, $0.16 higher than adjusted results in 2020 and $0.06 above the top end of our original 2021 guidance range. Financial performance for year was highlighted by strong customer growth, improving retail sales trends and continued investment in our state regulated utilities. These positive factors were partially offset by milder temperatures throughout 2021, resulting in a negative $0.05 variance for weather as compared to 2020 and a negative $0.14 variance compared to normal weather. Additionally, 2021 nonfuel O&M reflected the trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to the significantly reduced levels in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared to 2020 is included in today\u2019s release and earnings package. Weather-adjusted retail electricity sales were up 2.4% compared to 2020, approximately 1% better than our forecast for 2021. Almost all of this positive variance can be accounted for in residential electricity sales as a result of continued robust customer growth and an extension of the increased usage trends, which began in 2020. Residential sales outpaced our expectation for the year by 2.7%, reflecting what we think could represent a transition to sustained hybrid work practices across our service territories. We continue to analyze retail electricity sales relative to pre-pandemic levels. And in aggregate, in the fourth quarter, our weather-normalized retail electric sales exceeded sales in the fourth quarter of 2019. We are encouraged by these trends, and we\u2019ll continue to monitor the implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook. Our stronger-than-expected customer growth is a trend that differentiates our service territories. Over the last two years, we\u2019ve added an average of nearly 55,000 new residential electric customers and 30,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities. Average residential electric customer additions were 43% higher over the past two years than the average for the five years ended in 2019. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery, and our Southeast territories are on track to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment later this year. Further supporting these trends, the economic development pipeline within our Southeast service territories remains robust. For example, the average number of job announcements was 22% higher and business investment in Georgia was 39% higher than average for the years leading up to the pandemic. Macro trends in e-commerce and electric transportation, combined with a diverse well-trained workforce and a low cost of living, have combined to drive major locations and expansions of distribution centers, data centers, manufacturing facilities and headquarters into our service territories. Turning now to our expectations for 2022. Our adjusted earnings guidance for the year is $3.50 to $3.60 per share. The $3.55 midpoint represents a growth rate of approximately 7.5% from the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range. In the first quarter of 2022, we estimate that we will earn $0.90 per share. Included in our guidance is a more normalized assumption for retail electric sales growth of 0% to 1%, although a continuation of recent trends could deliver upside to that assumption. We continue to see long-term adjusted EPS growth in the range of 5% to 7%, consistent with adjusted earnings in a range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024. With 90% of total projected earnings over the five-year planning horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Additionally, our history of constructive regulation, strong credit ratings and disciplined O&M spending served to strengthen our outlook. Underlying our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% is a robust capital investment plan that continues to be driven by significant investment in our state-regulated businesses. Our base capital investment plan of approximately $41 billion, which excludes the capital required to complete Vogtle Units 3 and 4, supports our 2024 estimate for adjusted earnings per share of $4 to $4.30. This forecast represents a $2 billion increase in state-regulated utility investment for the common years 2022 through 2025 from our forecast a year ago. These increases in our forecast are the result of greater visibility into investments to upgrade our enterprise applications, serve major known customer expansions or additions, further improve our grid and protect our technology infrastructure as well as investments related to the transition of our fleet. We have long maintained a disciplined approach to capital forecasting within our state-regulated utility businesses. We don\u2019t use placeholders, and we don\u2019t include capital that isn\u2019t expected to earn our allowed returns. The result of this approach is that our forecast tend to grow, especially in the latter years as our visibility into customer growth increases, as regulatory processes unfold, as compliance obligations evolve and as our long-term system planning is refined. We fully expect this trend to continue, including in relation to Georgia Power\u2019s IRP. For example, neither the long-term hydro investment, nor the proposed company-owned energy storage systems are fully reflected in our forecast. Additionally, none of the renewable additions proposed in the IRP are included due to both their time frames and the potential for selecting purchased resources. Furthermore, we continue to believe Southern Power has significant opportunity to continue growing through investments to facilitate fleet transitions and the growth in clean energy infrastructure broadly across the United States. Southern Power\u2019s model has been distinctive since its beginning in the early 2000s, focused on long contracts with creditworthy counterparties and a risk-adjusted return profile that marries well with our overall value proposition. While we expect near-term opportunities to meet our criteria to be modest, we do believe opportunities will accelerate in future years. We have allocated up to $3 to Southern Power over the five-year plan, with approximately $250 million in 2022, $500 million in 2023 and $750 million annually for the remainder of the forecast. Again, these allocations of capital are not included in our base capital forecasts. In aggregate, our financial plan is anchored to our base capital forecast of $41 billion, and we believe upside potential exists in our state-regulated utility forecasts and our Southern Power allocation, representing spending of over $44 billion as part of our strategy to sustainably drive long-term growth in earnings and dividends. We also believe many of the same drivers for additional potential investment over the next five years could translate to investment opportunities beyond 2026 as we continue on our journey to net zero. And finally, we\u2019ve included an updated three-year financing plan in the appendix to our slide deck today. This plan, which is consistent with our updated capital investment plans and the potential capital investment opportunities we\u2019ve highlighted, continues to assume no equity need over our five-year plan horizon. Credit quality and strong investment-grade credit ratings remains a top priority. The expected improvement in our consolidated FFO to debt metrics equates to 200 to 300 -- a 200 to 300 basis-point increase from 2021 to 2022 levels by 2024. We\u2019ve included a slide in the appendix to highlight some of the drivers for this expected improvement. Combined with the expected reduction in construction risk over the next 12 to 18 months, we believe we are well positioned to support our credit quality objectives. Tom, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Dan. Southern Company strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder returns, and I believe the plan that we\u2019ve laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, our growing investments into our premier state-regulated utility franchises, the priority we place on credit quality and our commitment and actions towards net zero, all contribute towards making Southern Company a sustainable premier investment. A remarkable track record for dividends is another major contributor to that equation. For nearly three quarters of a century, we have paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter, including dividend increases in each of the past 20 years. As we look ahead, assuming adjusted earnings within our estimated range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024, a payout ratio that is expected to be at or below 70%, and a sustainable long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%, we believe that once Vogtle 3 and 4 are completed, our Board will have the opportunity to consider an increase in the rate of growth of dividends, further solidifying our long-term value proposition. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Listen, on the incremental cost, I just want to break this down, if you will. I mean it\u2019s -- a lot of numbers flying around here, if you can. So, of the $440 million you talked about in incremental cost, how much of that is driven by the co-owners agreement? Can you break that down, right? So you\u2019ve got $180 million from the sharing band. And then above that sharing band, what percentage of the cost is -- warrants you, if you will. So, can you kind of break down the sort of the successive pies, if you will? And then, of that, what was the base project cost that was agreed upon with co-owners? And what was the decision on COVID-related costs, right? Emphasis on that last piece, if you don\u2019t mind. Dan Tucker : So, Julien, this is Dan. So, the $440 million, you absolutely hit it right. Within there is $180 million. That $180 million is consistent with provisions in our agreement with co-owners, where Georgia Power bears a fixed percentage of incremental cost up to a certain point. And so, that $180 million is the maximum amount of exposure under those provisions. Above the thresholds for those provisions is where this option to tender cost responsibility to Georgia Power kicks in. And that number embedded in $440 million is $260 million. So, what that represents is Georgia Power\u2019s assumption of bearing $260 million, said a different way, 100% of all the dollars above the threshold. So that $260 million represents -- their share is already captured in the $480 million. This is capturing the co-owners piece that is assumed in these numbers to be tendered. And what was the second part of your question, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: COVID-related costs. I got a follow-up, more holistic as well. Dan Tucker : Yes. So, as we\u2019ve disclosed and we talked about last quarter, there is differing interpretations in this co-owner agreement as to exactly how those provisions work and exactly what the starting point works. So, rather than air those specific differences here on the call, let\u2019s let those conversations take place in the proper form. But suffice it to say, the two differing points of view is the starting point for where the initial provisions kick in and how COVID costs ultimately adjust any cost before sharing. Tom Fanning : And Dan, one more point, I think, and please, I know you\u2019ll correct me if I get this wrong, but we\u2019ve associated the cost with tender in this estimate. We have not given any credit for the value of megawatts tendered. At the high end of the estimate, the amount of megawatts tendered, if everybody tendered, maybe around 75 to 80 megawatts. At the level in which we\u2019ve estimated, we think it could be around 30. Dan Tucker : That\u2019s correct, Tom. Tom Fanning : And we\u2019ve given no credit to any value associated with those megawatts. We\u2019ve talked about this on prior calls, the fact that you may have megawatts that\u2019s going to be carbon-free, resilient for decades to come, we think it would have real value. We\u2019ve reflected no value in any of these estimates. Dan Tucker : And just to put a finer point on all this, Julien, we\u2019ve included this $440 million, and that represents an estimate of an outcome. We do not, at this stage, have an agreement with our co-owners. We still have that difference of opinion. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And maybe can you speak a little bit to this process then, right? You talked about this March 8th date with the co-owners here. Any initial indications on where they stand? Obviously, this 90% is a high bar. But theoretically, they could vote to proceed and then related to that, they could tender the incremental cost to you, right? I just want to make sure I understand the kind of two separate parallel processes here. Tom Fanning : Yes. Julien, the way we would think about that is make them completely separate, okay? Well, the process is simple. By the contract that we entered into way back when, what was it, 2018, I guess, and I guess we signed it in early \u201819. But that kind of provision spoke to a potential outcome that was really onerous, like there was some cataclysmic problem, and we could all go our way. Our calculus was pretty simple. We are this close to loading fuel and ultimately getting Unit 3 on service and then ultimately Unit 4. To us, it was an easy decision to proceed. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But the processes are separate. And from their perspective, they could vote to proceed and then ultimately allocate -- tender their megawatts to you, as you just talked about a moment ago, right? Dan Tucker : It\u2019s completely separate processes. Yes. Tom Fanning : So, they could decide to proceed and separately they can tender. Dan Tucker : That\u2019s right. And there\u2019s a 120-day to 180-day clock that we\u2019ve disclosed in our 10-K as well that is really the time period to clarify tender or not. And the ultimate calculation, we alluded to megawatts, we alluded to dollars, all of that would not get buttoned up until Unit 4 was in service and all of the costs were known. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. James Ward : Hey. Tom, it\u2019s actually James Ward on for Shar. Thank you for taking my question. Tom, at a high level, when we think about the IRPs and let\u2019s say, Georgia Power specifically, as you were mentioning before, I understand that any storage or hydro improvement spend would be incremental. But what about transmission? Is there any IRP-related spend baked into the $41 billion base plan, or is anything that comes out of the IRP going to be incremental? Dan Tucker : Hey. James, this is Dan. So yes, there is transmission spend in there. In this forecast period for the five years, it is modest. Keep in mind that the plan includes retiring coal units in the \u201827, \u201828 time frame and then further again in 2035. So, the time line to construct and frankly, plan and permit these transmission projects is going to take the bulk of this forecast period and spending really occurs beyond. The other just detail, James, in the way you asked your question, I just want to make sure it\u2019s clear. There is some storage reflected in the capital forecast, but not -- it\u2019s a fraction of what has been assumed as a planning assumption in the IRP. It\u2019s the one project that Georgia Power is specifically asking for approval of is in our capital plan. Tom Fanning : And the only other thing I\u2019ll add is that -- go ahead. James Ward : Sorry, please go ahead. Tom Fanning : The only other thing I will add, I think I\u2019ve done this before in kind of private conversations with you all one-on-one. But, as you start thinking about retiring Vogtle -- I mean -- I\u2019m sorry, Bowen 3 and 4, there creates a need in North Georgia. And we\u2019ve talked about that further study is required in order to evaluate how you replace that? Is that going to be more solar? Is it going to be a combined cycle? Is it going to be importing megawatts from the south to the north and therefore, incremental transmission. We just haven\u2019t done all that work yet. James Ward : Got you. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate the color there. Switching gears to asset optimization, understanding that you do not need equity in the five-year plan. You\u2019ve been very clear about that. But when you look at LDCs trading hands at nearly 2 times rate base, how do you think about the opportunity to sell an asset at that level and then reinvest the proceeds into decarbonization efforts at your electric utilities? Tom Fanning : Well, I think we demonstrated over the years that we\u2019re both -- in the world of M&A, we\u2019re both buyers and sellers. What we\u2019re always seeking to do is put assets in the hands of the best owner. That\u2019s just kind of our dogma, and I think we follow through on it. What\u2019s interesting about our gas properties is that they have been able to contribute like 10% earnings per share growth, primarily focused on safety-related pipeline replacement programs. Since the acquisition of what is now Southern Company Gas, we have well exceeded our expectations on the acquisition. So, in order to think about cap allocation, as you do and we think about it all the time, selling something like our asset in Illinois relative to reinvesting in the core, we always have to consider what\u2019s best for our long-term growth rate, what\u2019s best on a risk-adjusted basis. We\u2019ll continually do that. Dan Tucker : Yes. And James, you made the point in your question. I mean, we don\u2019t have an identified equity need in the forecast, and we think our LDCs are a great property. Tom Fanning : Yes. It would be purely a value play as opposed to a need. James Ward : And then one final one here just to follow on from Julien\u2019s question earlier to clarify here. So given that the Vogtle co-owners are already protected by cost caps, and this is just at a high level here, is there any incentive or other reasons that we should be aware of or that might be worth keeping in mind for why Oglethorpe or MEAG would not want to proceed at this point since they have those cost caps in place? Just help us understand how they might be thinking. Tom Fanning : We\u2019re not aware of any reason that exists like that. James Ward : Got it. Dan Tucker : They have to go through different processes, James. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Maybe just coming back to Vogtle real quick here. Just trying to get a little bit more clarity. Have any of the missing inspection reports resulted in the need to rework completed sections of the plant? And also just curious if the NRC has kind of weighed in here on the ITACC issue? And any thoughts you have as far as what could be done in the future for Vogtle 4 to -- controls that could be implemented to avoid these issues? Tom Fanning : Yes. Interestingly, I was just in Augusta visiting with Glen Chick, our -- I think he\u2019s just a superlative manager of the site, along with Steve Kuczynski. And we actually went through different systems, at this point, and we are trying, we are efforting to begin with the inspection report fixed with what we believe are the toughest, hardest issues to deal with. I can\u2019t guarantee that. But so far, with 30% complete, we haven\u2019t found a need for any of that comprehensive rework. Certainly, as we see things that aren\u2019t according to specs or per an inspection requirement, then we will fix it. But nothing comprehensive, as you\u2019re suggesting. Second question? Jeremy Tonet : Well, I was just curious, I guess -- that\u2019s helpful there. Thank you for that. And the NRC, if they\u2019ve kind of weighed in on the ITACC issues and any kind of... Tom Fanning : NRC. Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. Hey. The NRC\u2019s posture, again, I think I say this pretty regularly. They\u2019re a very tough requiring regulator, but we think they do a great job. And that\u2019s the reason why the United States nuclear fleet is the envy of the world. Getting it right, as we so often say, will allow us to have an asset that will provide energy carbon-free, resilient for 60 to 80 years. So, we\u2019re all in on getting it right. The NRC, likewise, is their primary focus. In other words, they\u2019re not as concerned, I\u2019m guessing, with schedule and cost. They want to make sure that whatever we build is as appropriate to nuclear safety standards as exist in America today. So, they support our efforts to find these things. And I think for the amount of ITACCs that we\u2019ve already submitted, something like 275 or so, I think we\u2019ve had very few problems with those ITACCs. That process has gone well, which says that once we get the work packages turned over and all the paper done in nuclear standard as it is supposed to be, we\u2019ve had an enormous success rate in dealing with the NRC part of the equation. Jeremy Tonet : And then, just pivoting a bit towards SMRs, just wondering if you could discuss Southern\u2019s involvement with SMRs? And where you see the tech going over the coming years? And do you think there will be support to rate base spend if the technology has proven up in the future? Just wondering if you\u2019ve had conversations with commissioners or other stakeholders on if this could be a potential down the road? Tom Fanning : Yes. My conversations with kind of future nuclear technologies have really been more -- I haven\u2019t talked to the states at all. That really would be the realm of Mark Crosswhite in Alabama or Chris Womack in Georgia or Anthony Wilson in Mississippi. In my conversations with DOE, with folks in that or in the administration, I\u2019ve had those conversations, too. In my opinion, I know other people are more bullish on SMRs than I am. But you still have to deal with enormous security issues. You still have to deal with kind of the NIMBY issues associated with nuclear. So, I\u2019ve always felt that nuclear lends itself to scale, now. SMRs do absolutely have an important place in our nuclear future. My opinion, it would be in the niche areas like military bases. The military already does SMRs on submarines and aircraft carriers. So, it\u2019s easy to conceive SMRs showing up on big nuclear installations. So, it also provides them a degree of resilience. I get that. We have been -- and we participate in SMRs, you should know that. So, our nuclear team and our R&D team are involved in the SMR process. We\u2019ve actually been asked to get involved in a significant way in SMRs and given -- I don\u2019t want to be distracted with anything other than getting Vogtle 3 and 4 done, we\u2019ve really stayed away from that. On the other hand, we view great progress, potential with the so called Gen IV reactors, the molten chloride salts. We\u2019ve worked with Bill Gates and his team on that. We are -- when you think about the R&D S curve, I think we\u2019ve done a lot of work on the science, and I would call it the bench science of it and the very small kind of element of starting up that S curve. The next kind of big slugs of development on the Gen IV reactors will require hundreds of millions of dollars. I know I\u2019ve talked to Secretary Granholm; Deputy Secretary, Turk, other folks that it would be great as the DOE is looking to put money to work, especially in the technology development area. This is a place where we could partner with the federal government and really move quickly up that S curve to make Gen IV reactors a commercial reality. In our own planning processes, they start to show up as an option, probably in the late 2030. So, let\u2019s say, 2035 to 2040. And as an economic matter, they tend to compete with CCS-controlled combined cycle technologies. So depending on how the technology and cost expectations evolve, you will see us either continue with combined cycles and capturing the carbon and sequestering it or pursuing new Gen 4 reactors. But again, that\u2019s an issue that\u2019s going to show up in the very late 2030s. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Maybe just a real quick follow-up here. Curious on advanced nuclear. Thanks for your thoughts there. But as far as what technologies could make the most sense? Just wondering, light water, what Vogtle is doing versus molten salt or other technologies. Just wondering what you think of give and takes between them. Tom Fanning : Well, I think, the obvious difference between kind of what we\u2019re building at Vogtle and the so-called Gen IV reactors is this issue of the fuel and the core. Effectively, the Gen IV reactors have the characteristic that a meltdown is virtually impossible. And therefore, you need less containment structures and therefore less capital cost in order to put those units into play and have them be as safe as we expect them to be. That is the real big difference. It\u2019s a capital cost difference associated with how the reactors melt down characteristic could occur. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : So, I have a question. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever actually asked the question about Southern Power. So, looking at your past disclosure, and it seems like your gas plants are only hedged to about 80%, meaning the contracts are for about 80% of the output. We\u2019ve seen quite an expansion of spark spreads across the country. I struggle with your regions. So, what, Georgia, Alabama, and North Carolina, and I\u2019m not sure if that translates into higher dispatch or earnings of these assets. Again, if you could comment. Tom Fanning : Yes. Angie, I don\u2019t know we\u2019d have to run the numbers down with you. Our own math would say, they\u2019re 92% contracted for about 10 years. Dan Tucker : Yes. And importantly, Angie, so in front of the Georgia Public Service Commission, as part of the IRP, the vast majority of the gas PPAs that are in front of them for approval are Southern Power gas plants. And so, that\u2019s going to extend those units coverage for another 10 years. Tom Fanning : And recall that we follow the same kind of rubric in contracting our assets as opposed to merchant players. In that, we don\u2019t take fuel risk. We earn a return on and return of capital and pass through the fuel and energy price. Angie Storozynski : Just moving on... Tom Fanning : In fact, Angie, -- Angie, excuse me. I\u2019ll just give you one more data point. 95% contracted through 2026, 92% through 2031. That\u2019s the nerdy data. Angie Storozynski : Good. Now just going back to Vogtle. So, yes, I read -- I actually just reread the agreement -- the ownership agreement and that additional around about COVID-related costs. So, we\u2019re still seemingly in the COVID era. So, I\u2019m assuming that some of this incremental cost related to the asset is still related to COVID and how does that come into this whole discussion about the sharing agreement with the co-owners? And then, secondly, we haven\u2019t -- you haven\u2019t mentioned inflation. And so, I\u2019m just wondering, how is that impacting the cost profile of this construction project? Tom Fanning : Yes. And thanks for that. This is my opinion I\u2019m giving you as opposed to fact, I guess. But in my opinion, it is unquestionable. It is unreasonable to assume that COVID had no impact. And so, the real art of the deal is to figure out how much of that impact manifested itself. If you dial back on to those dark days when the first COVID thing hit and we were deciding whether to shut the project down or not, I think it\u2019s very clear that we had to operate under a completely different operating regime on the site. Remember, we stood up a medical village. We did all sorts of things in order to continue this very important project. We have estimates that we provided to Georgia Public Service Commission. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve updated those recently. But certainly, I think any reasonable person would say that there have been COVID impacts on the site. Dan Tucker : Yes. And I would just say in terms of this most recent cost increase, it\u2019s certainly not the driver. It\u2019s not a major driver. But Tom\u2019s point, it\u2019s logically an element of what\u2019s going on. Tom Fanning : And I think we provided the chart in the appendix material, you can see even this most recent whatever this -- Omicron, it had an enormous spike in the December to January time frame. So, certainly, it had an impact. We saw it in -- especially over the holidays, we always expect to see more absenteeism and a variety of other things. We certainly saw it there as well. Dan Tucker : But it\u2019s fair to say, like everyone is, with every wave, with every impact, we are getting better at working in this environment, and it becomes increasingly less disruptive and thus less of a cost impact. Tom Fanning : And let me hit one other kind of controversial point, but we watch this like hawks. Recall, at one time, we had 9,000 people on site. And there was a lot of concern was this somehow COVID hot bed. Well, in fact, the data shows that our COVID experience is just about similar to the surrounding communities. We don\u2019t have a different experience on the site than in the surrounding counties. Angie Storozynski : Yes. Thank you. How about inflation though? Is it already embedded in this additional cost estimate? Tom Fanning : Yes. But, Angie, most of the inflation sensitive stuff is already procured. Our supply chains are already spoken for all the major equipments there. I suppose there would be some labor. We\u2019re paying top decile right now. I suppose that could come up later, but it hasn\u2019t been a big effect now. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then, the last question. So, looking on stronger earnings where -- I mean, have been actually over the last couple of years. Now, despite unfavorable weather, so is the load growth the main driver, or is it just cost efficiencies? What is putting you above the high end of your guidance almost consistently despite unfavorable weather? Tom Fanning : Well, Dan\u2019s done a great job managing the cost structures of the system. Actually, Dan didn\u2019t have anything to do with it all, but people in the operating companies did. But, I\u2019ll tell you the big surprise. I said this on Squawk Box this morning and the data we\u2019ve provided you, shows it. We beat our residential estimates by 2.7%. In other words, we were projecting that to be down, and it was actually up. And we think that that is due to a change in lifestyle. I think we budgeted as if we thought there was this return to work and therefore, we would see like a 2.2% reduction in residential sales because people are showing up at work. Well, in fact, our own data, if you look at Southern Company\u2019s experience, our old model was about 80% of the people came to work every day. I think -- and they were 20% that were virtual, probably call centers. Now, we\u2019re seeing about only 25% are here every day with about 50% hybrid. They\u2019re coming in and out a few days a week, some more, some less, and then about 25% virtual. What\u2019s interesting about that is the sales in the residential sector were sustained at a much higher level than what we thought. We thought they\u2019d drop off. They actually increased a bit. That uplift really helped us this year. Dan Tucker : And just as you look at our forecast, look, we certainly haven\u2019t assumed that that continues into the future because one year doesn\u2019t make a trend, but we reasonably believe it might. So if you look at our forecast for residential sales for 2022, it actually reflects year-over-year negative. And that\u2019s, frankly, mitigated by assumption of strong customer growth. So, to your point, Angie, there\u2019s certainly upside even in 2022 if we see these trends continue. Tom Fanning : The customer growth has been awfully attractive for us, so over 50,000 on the electric side, what was it 27,000, something like that on the on the gas side. So, we continue to do that. And we think that is kind of a function too of people being able to work remotely. And so, they tend to go to places that have low input costs, attractive place to live. Our economic development data shows that as well. So, I think some of the stuff, Dan, you talked about in the script, it just looks good, particularly for Georgia, but even Alabama is coming back, and we\u2019re doing well. We have reason to be bullish about the long-term viability of our franchise. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : So, two questions. First, just on the Vogtle ITACC issues. So, I know you knew all along that the paperwork and that the trail of all that was super important, and you\u2019ve been doing all the work. So, kind of -- could you give us a little flavor of just what has gone wrong here because obviously, it\u2019s something that you were very focused on from the beginning? Tom Fanning : 100%, Steve. And I think I said this in media earlier, but it\u2019s true. I get up every morning throughout the day, in the middle of the night, think about Vogtle and what we can do and all that. And I was, the folks at the site have been particularly frustrated at this recent development. When we left you on the call and I guess it was late October, early November, everybody, the site too, was very bullish on the fact that man, here we go, we\u2019re getting ready to file for 103(g) and load fuel in the whole bit. And when we started getting into the final systems related to the final ITACC, so right, we\u2019ve done 100 and -- I mean, we\u2019ve done 275, we had 123 left. We had already done in order to complete these tests and a lot of this equipment is already operated within the testing regimes. We had done physical and visual inspections, but what we found when we got ready to turn over these systems for the paper, and important part of the paper are these inspection reports. And we found in many cases, they were just either incomplete or missing. Let me give you an example. But, this is an example. This is relevant. For every bolt in that plant theoretically, we would have to ascertain certificate the provenance of that bolt. In other words, we\u2019d have to prove that we know that the metallurgy worked and where it came from and everything else to the extent an inspection report did not account for the provenance of a bolt, we had to either take the bolt out and put in the bolt that was certified or take the bolt out and test it to make sure that it met our standards. This is at the very end of the process for the very final equipment and systems that were related to the turnover before we filed for 103(g). This is at the tail end of the process. And when we found this out, we just had to go stop, we\u2019ve got to do a complete review of all of these inspection reports. And that\u2019s what you see right now. I am frustrated about it, but it is something we have to do. We talk about this is the first plant we\u2019ve constructed in 40 years. Well, this is the first nuclear documentation we\u2019ve had to do in 40 years. I wish we had found it sooner. We just didn\u2019t. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then, totally separate topic. You were, I think, Tom, pretty accurate with caution about the build back better getting done last year. And I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re feeling about maybe a climate only type package getting done in Congress this year? Tom Fanning : Strictly my opinion, and I was in the meeting with the President and all that. You know what\u2019s interesting, and I work with both sides of the aisle here. I think long term, both parties agree that we should do some something. I think the methods of doing something, especially in light of the inflation signals we are seeing and potentially the national security issues we are seeing right now lend themselves to nothing happening for the rest of the year. I wish it would. I don\u2019t think it will. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Paul Fremont : I guess, my first question is going to be on turnovers. I think initially, you had talked about doing some of the turnovers, those that were necessary to load fuel and delaying other turnovers that you thought were less necessary. In light of the documentation issues, are you now looking to do all of the turnovers before you load fuel? Tom Fanning : No. I think there\u2019s a set you have to turn over in order to get to 103(g). And there could be some others in between 103(g) and loading fuel. Let me give you a little bit of kind of where we are. So on Unit 3, now I\u2019m doing big hunky thing. There\u2019s a little less than 100 systems, 96 or so. You would split those into 162 subsystems, okay? So, there\u2019s 11 total to go. And since our last call, we\u2019ve gotten 5 of those turnovers complete. If I think about what\u2019s remaining here, I would say that we have 3 to go for 103(g) and 6 to go on fuel load and 2 that we can complete after fuel load. They\u2019re not necessary to the nuclear safety side of things. Was that helpful? Paul Fremont : Absolutely. In the past, I think you\u2019ve estimated or you\u2019ve put out estimates of COVID-related costs that went as high as 400. In the upcoming VCM 26 filing, are you going to update your estimate of COVID-related costs or not? Tom Fanning : Yes. The 400 -- 444 was at 100% dollars, our share of that was 160. I don\u2019t know the stats of that. It didn\u2019t come up recently. So, I think it\u2019s still an open issue. Dan Tucker : Yes. And there was some degree of estimating future impacts in the original number, and I think it\u2019s been consistent with that. Tom Fanning : Yes. We\u2019ve not provided\u2026 Paul Fremont : So, is that 440 the sort of the most recent number that you\u2019ve put out publicly? Tom Fanning : Yes. Dan Tucker : Yes. And so, you typically see us disclose it as 160 to 200, that\u2019s our share. The 440 is 100% dollars. And just to be clear, no change reflected in VCM 26. Paul Fremont : You\u2019re saying no change? Dan Tucker : Correct. Paul Fremont : In VCM 26? Tom Fanning : We just haven\u2019t created an addition based on the latest Omicron effects. I mean, clearly, there were, we just haven\u2019t updated the estimate. Paul Fremont : And then the numbers you put out for the cost sharing, potential write-offs are after-tax numbers. Can we get pretax numbers for those? The $480 million and the $440 million? Dan Tucker : Yes. Those are pretax, Paul. Those are pretax. Tom Fanning : So, that adds $920 million, $686 million is the after-tax portion. Dan Tucker : Yes. If you look at our deck on slide 6, there\u2019s $920 million listed there. That\u2019s pretax. Total after tax for that is $686 million, and then we\u2019ve broken down the components. But all those -- all that breakdown is pretax. Paul Fremont : All that is pretax. Okay. And then, the most -- the highest number of ITACCs that you\u2019ve done in a given month, I think, is 18. How confident are you in being able to sort of do mid-30s type numbers once you\u2019re able to sort of do the catch-up work on the documentation? Tom Fanning : Yes. Paul, what you have to understand and back where we were in October, November, we\u2019re basically finishing the work, and what we found is the inspection reports were lacking. So, this work is ready to go. The table is set. Once we get the documentation done, we\u2019ll be ready to send those things in. We feel good about the schedule. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re finishing construction. Paul Fremont : And in terms of the -- so are you completely done with all of the construction or the remediation work for Unit 3 that you had identified sort of in the fall? Tom Fanning : Yes. No, I just mentioned like an example of some of the remediation that might have to be done in order to conform with an inspection report. So, there\u2019s other examples, but that\u2019s it. Paul Fremont : Okay. And then, maybe the last question. The contracting of the Southern Power plants under the Georgia IRP, it sounds like the net income that you\u2019re earning is based on some book value calculation on the plan. So, would the Georgia IRP, if it were adopted, at least with respect to the Southern Power plants, likely the earnings from those plants would remain roughly the same, or would there be any type of sort of -- would there be any material change? Dan Tucker : I think the short answer, Paul, is no material change. These are market contracts. So, all of these contracts are being awarded to Southern Power under a competitive RFP process. And so, it\u2019s going to reflect the current market for those senior contracts. Tom Fanning : Over the life of the contract, the IRRs would be similar. And when you think about -- what we have said about the market broadly is that we\u2019ve kind of pulled back on the market. This is kind of elsewhere in the United States because there was so much supply and the demand was waning and there was a lot of uncertainty. We saw the margins really getting tight and so we didn\u2019t play. But for the things we do that we ultimately will sign up for pretty consistent IRRs and pretty consistent ROEs. The ROEs typically are a wee bit better than what we would find in our regulated jurisdiction, reflective of a little bit of the higher risk. Paul Fremont : Great. And then last question for me. The $686 million, should we assume either equity or asset sales to fund that? Dan Tucker : Yes. So, again, we -- I think I said in my prepared remarks, Paul, that we don\u2019t see a need for equity in this five-year outlook. So, let me just hit that a little more broadly because I think it\u2019s important. But absolutely, nothing has changed about our near-term or long-term objectives when it comes to credit quality. We\u2019ve said kind of the last several months that as we move closer to completion of the project, any change in the cost or schedule will evaluate to see if equity is needed, essentially because we are getting so close to the end and because of all the proactive things that we did in response to other changes, and frankly, we did a little bit more than what was needed. So that has positioned us really well. And I want to also emphasize the improvement in the metrics that comes later on. I think we put a slide in the appendix that shows some of the component of the uplift in FFO that will occur in a \u201823, \u201824 time frame. That also is near enough in time horizon to give us comfort with our overall financial profile. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Commodity prices are up across the board, obviously, that\u2019s a bigger issue than any one team or person can manage. How should we think about -- given what\u2019s happened to commodity prices, and given the investment you\u2019re making, some of which like Vogtle will help reduce the commodity exposure. How should we just think about the bill across your biggest businesses? So I\u2019m thinking in Alabama and Georgia Power, I\u2019m thinking about the bill and for Southern Company Gas. Like what\u2019s happening to the total bill for the customer as we enter 2022 and think about \u201823 as well? Tom Fanning : Yes. It\u2019s interesting stuff, man. When you look at the data, gas prices increased \u201821 versus \u201820, 92%, like we averaged, I think, $3.82 per million Btu versus $1.99 a year ago. So that\u2019s kind of a big deal. Now each of our jurisdictions have managed, I think, well, their unrecovered fuel balances. Georgia just got an increase, doesn\u2019t wipe it out completely, but it did really well. Alabama used some of its earnings otherwise in 2021 to completely wipe out its fuel balance. So, one of the things we are very mindful of -- and I appreciate the way you phrased the question. We are very mindful of burden to customers, and we manage that like hawks. I think we\u2019re in really good shape right now. Michael Lapides : Okay. I know you\u2019ve done a lot of work over the years with the Federal Reserve in Atlanta. Just curious how -- when you think about just the economic impact to the service territory and you\u2019ve got a high-growth service territory relative to a lot of your peers. How does this kind of -- how do you think about it when you meet with folks outside of the Company about what it means for economic growth? Tom Fanning : Yes. Very interesting stuff. If you look at the data, we\u2019re seeing -- even our industrial numbers, I said this on Squawk today, while it will show that it looks like things are slowing down a bit on the industrial sales side, the momentum numbers would tell you that and potentially the first derivative. In fact, two of the segments that underperformed or decreased year-over-year were chemicals and paper, but the paper was newsprint had a big closure of a plant there. The chemicals was a -- chemical plant, caustic soda and chlorine, that closed as well. If you wipe away those two big plant closures, our industrial sales actually were better than what we expected again. So pretty good stuff. Now, it is very clear that inflation will eventually eat into the growth in the economy. I was kind of visiting with some of the Fed work and all that here recently, you\u2019re familiar with the old permanent income hypothesis. I think people have felt wealthier lately, and people are still spending as if inflation hasn\u2019t visited them yet. It is inconceivable though that that won\u2019t catch up at some point. You saw these hot retail sales. My sense is as inflation effects continue that those sales will start to wane. So, there will be a slowdown in the economy. Now, the real $50,000 question is, when does inflation start to recede a bit? A lot of stuff right now says that\u2019s a 2023 issue that we could start to see inflation getting back to a more normal level. I think the underlying presumption in that one is that the supply chain works itself out. Right now, we\u2019ve had such an imbalance in supply and demand that prices invariably are high. And for the lead time to procure certain goods and services, it is really sticky right now. So, the big swings are supply chain unwinding and getting back to normal, people adjusting to higher prices and therefore, reduced spending and therefore, reduced heat in the economy. Those are all the factors that I think will go into this point. For now, the economy looks really good in the Southeast, but it\u2019s inconceivable to me that it won\u2019t slow down a bit over the next year or so. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then, one last one, just thinking about whether you do the gigawatt of storage at Georgia Power, obviously, that kind of depends on the end of the IRP process as well as if you were to wind up doing more incremental solar at either Georgia or Alabama Power or at Southern Power. How are you thinking about the renewable supply chain? Because there\u2019s been lots of discussion and commentary. One or Two of your peers have talked about supply chain becoming an issue for their non-regulated contracted solar business. I\u2019m just curious what insights your team is getting in terms of the ability to procure things like panels or lithium-ion other, and the ability to actually install at the pace you\u2019d like to install? Dan Tucker : Yes. So Michael, this is Dan. So right now, we\u2019re not in a big construction period. And so, we\u2019re fortunate to not be experiencing as acutely as some of our peers right now, some of those plays. We\u2019ve seen some. We are in the middle of the storage project out in California, we\u2019ve seen some modest delays, but nothing that\u2019s going to impact the project overall. That\u2019s part of the supply chain and then really combined with I think how everyone is seeing the near-term markets is why we also have this ramp-up in our expectations for Southern Power. You heard me say we\u2019ve allocated just the $250 million this year, $500 million the following year. And that\u2019s really in recognition that there are projects actively on our radar screen today, and we\u2019re a bit aspirational that those might come to fruition. But to the extent they don\u2019t, I think what you\u2019ll see us logically do is push those dollars out a little further in time and have opportunities later. Tom Fanning : There\u2019s another conversation I\u2019ve been having in D.C., whether it\u2019s Secretary Granholm, who\u2019s been terrific or Dep Sec, David Turk who is a terrific. As a matter of national security, as a matter of economic opportunity, one of the things that we need to do as a the nation is resource these important supply chains domestically that will grow manufacturing, grow jobs, grow personal income. It\u2019s a real winner. And I think some of the money that\u2019s been put out in the incentives, whether it\u2019s inside DOE right now or in the infrastructure bill elsewhere is to think about ways to promote the domestic supply of these things and really get it going. Now, when I say that, you\u2019re talking five years from now. That isn\u2019t going to happen immediately, but people are considering it. And I bet you, you would get broad bipartisan support for that strategy. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thanks, Dan. Tom Fanning : You bet, Michael. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : No. Thank you all for attending with us this afternoon. This is an important call. This is a frustrating time for us all. We were ready to go there, we thought kind of early this year. And now with this delay, it looks as if we\u2019ll be end of the year for Unit 3. And we\u2019ve allowed for an additional quarter, just given the uncertainty that we\u2019ve seen in the past. We think these schedules align closer to what the staff and the commission has been kind of thinking about. But I can assure you we\u2019re on the case. We all spend our time at the site. Those people are fixated on getting it right along our partners Bechtel. And when we build this thing, when we get it in service, we are right at the end of that process, it will be of the quality that is necessary in the United States nuclear industry. And we\u2019re going to be proud of it for decades to come. Otherwise, the Company is performing as well as it possibly can, whether it\u2019s our reliability, our resilience, our customer satisfaction, the way our employees feel, we were number one in military employer. Look, all of these data, they sound like kind of headlines and billboards and pablum. But I think they really speak to our dogma here at Southern that this is a company built to last, that these indicators are things that will prove that we are sustainable in our business model for years and years to come, and we\u2019re very proud of that. And I want to thank all the thousands of employees at Southern for making that their part of their day, every day. It\u2019s way beyond making, moving and selling. It\u2019s all wound up and making sure that the communities we serve are better off because we\u2019re there. We do that every day, and we will continue to do that. We look forward to getting the projects behind us and getting into 2024, and a financial position, the integrity of this company will be better than it ever has been, in my experience. So, thank you, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Kelly. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the first quarter ahead of our estimates. The economies within our Southeast service territories are among the best in the United States and we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2022. Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I will first provide an update on recent progress at Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion timeline and capital cost forecast for both units are unchanged from the updates that we provided last quarter. Since that time, we've seen sustained progress consistent with our expectations for each unit. The NRC completed its follow-up inspection this week and issued its final supplemental report. The inspection verified that Southern Nuclear effectively implemented the corrective actions and remediation efforts at the site. No additional findings were identified during the follow-up inspection and the findings identified last year have been closed. With this step complete, the Vogtle site returns to the baseline inspection program. Let's focus now on Unit 3. We continue to progress towards receipt of the NRC's 103G letter. All necessary systems have been turned over from construction to testing, and nearly all the inspection records necessary for submission of the remaining ITAAC are now complete. Associated with this progress, 70 ITAAC were submitted to the NRC since our last earnings call and 53 ITAAC remain. Of these remaining ITAAC, the last 30 to 40 are expected to be completed just prior to submitting the all ITAAC complete letter to the NRC in support of the 103G letter. Considering our progress over the last two months, we have provided an updated ITAAC completion schedule. Following receipt of the 103G letter from the NRC and as Unit 3 continues its transformation from construction to operations, our efforts will be focused on completing the remaining inspection records, system turnovers and the necessary preoperational and component test required to load fuel later this year. Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 94% complete. Unit 4 continues to make progress in advance of cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. We believe we have the resources we need on site for Unit 4 and have a clear plan for transitioning additional personnel from Unit 3 as we continue our focus on increasing productivity and ensuring first-time quality. Overall, construction completion has averaged 0.9% per month since the start of the year, supportive of a September 2023 in-service and ahead of the 0.4% average projected to be needed through the year-end to achieve a December 2023 in-service date. For electrical production specifically, progress on Unit 4 is meeting our current expectations. However, electrical production will need to increase to support our projected in-service dates. The schedule changes announced last year required Vogtle 3 and 4 owners to affirmatively vote to proceed with the project, which, in late February, they unanimously voted to do. This decision underscores the importance of the 2,200 megawatts of baseload carbon-free energy, which will be vital to increasing the availability of net zero resources for customers across the state. We value our partners on Vogtle 3 and 4 and the relationships that we have had with them across multiple endeavors for decades. We look forward to our continued partnership as we work to bring Vogtle units 3 and 4 safely online, providing Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We are pleased with the progress at the site over the past few months and incredibly proud of the entire team at Vogtle units 3 and 4 for their relentless commitment to completing this important project safely and with the utmost quality. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you. Dan Tucker : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2022 was $0.97, $0.01 lower than last year and $0.07 above our estimate. The primary driver for the variance to last year was higher non-fuel O&M, which reflects a trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to significantly reduced levels during the first quarter of 2021 and then largely offset by constructive state regulatory actions and robust customer growth at our state-regulated utilities. When looking at adjusted EPS compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers were continued strong customer growth and cost control. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted quarterly results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to retail sales in the economy. In the first quarter, weather normal retail sales were approximately 1% higher than first quarter 2021. This increase reflects stronger commercial and industrial sales from the continued economic recovery in our service territories, somewhat offset by lower residential sales as schools and businesses continue to transition from remote environments to hybrid or in-person modes throughout the quarter. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of nearly 11,000 residential electric customers and over 7,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. This level of customer growth is driven by a strong labor market recovery and our Southeast service territories are expected to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment later this year. Additionally, the Port of Savannah, which is the fourth largest port in the nation and a major contributor to jobs and economic growth in Georgia, experienced a 3% year-over-year increase in container volumes in the first quarter of 2022, ahead of 2021's record pace as elevated US consumer demand continues to drive record cargo levels. Recent figures from the Georgia Port Authority also signaled that congestion is easing with only a handful of ships currently at anchor outside of the Port of Savannah, down from a peak of around 30 in mid-September of last year. Additionally, the recent approval of the Garden City Terminal West expansion is expected to increase the Port of Savanna's annual capacity by more than 15% by the end of 2024. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. In the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter last year, economic development announcements in our regulated electric service territory saw a 168% increase in payroll additions and a 66% increase in business investment, respectively. The first quarter closed with 230 active projects in the pipeline for the State of Georgia alone, which is well-above historical averages and new job additions in Georgia exceeded 7,000, an all-time high for the first quarter of the year. We remain encouraged by the economic trends that we are seeing as we continue to monitor the implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflationary pressures on our outlook. And I have two final topics before turning the call back over to Tom. First, for the second quarter, our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.80 per share; and second, I'd like to highlight our recent dividend increase announcement. Earlier this month, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.72 per share. This action marks the 21st consecutive annual increase and for three quarters of the century dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to, or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record reinforces Southern Company as a premier sustainable investment. And as we mentioned on our last call, we believe once Vogtle 3 and 4 are completed, our Board will have the opportunity to consider accelerating the rate of dividend growth, further supporting our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors. Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Dan. Sustainability has always been a top priority for Southern Company. In recent years, our plans and progress have received heightened interest from our investors, customers, communities, employees and other stakeholders. We have a long, strong history of constructive engagement with all stakeholders and we are excited about the recent release of a dedicated sustainability website, which provides additional transparency on core environmental, social and governance topics. This new site highlights the tremendous work underway across our company to help us reach our sustainability and business objectives, as we seek to build the future of energy. Additionally, just this week, we published a report outlining our just transition principles and look to continue enhancing our disclosures. We know that stakeholders are increasingly interested in information related to our sustainability efforts, and we remain committed to open and transparent communication. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the great job that employees throughout Southern Company do each and every day. National Lineman Appreciation Day, which was observed this month, specifically recognizes the important contribution of line workers and those supporting them to our country from. From extreme heat to bitter cold to answering the call of those that need thousands of miles away for days and weeks at a time, the hard work and unwavering dedication that these men and women display, day in and day out is truly inspirational. Moreover, last month, the Edison Electric Institute and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers presented the prestigious Edwin D. Hill Award to Alabama Power and the IBEW System Council U-19. Through the National Utility Industry Training Fund and the electrical training ALLIANCE, Alabama Power and the IBEW are providing current and prospective employees with the appropriate training necessary to install and maintain the fiber infrastructure that enables grid automation and resiliency and improve community access to broadband. It is an honor to receive this award, and we remain committed to continued support and investment in our workforce to ensure that our employees have the skills and training needed to successfully meet the ever-evolving needs of the customers that we have the privilege to serve. Thank you in joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Shar, how are you? Shar, are you there? Are you on mute? If you do, you owe us $20. Operator, I don't hear Shar. You want to go to the next question? Operator : Yes, certainly, one moment. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the time and opportunity. Appreciate it. Thanks for comments too. So just on Unit 4, I just wanted to talk a little bit about productivity here. How is that trending versus historical and your own expectations? And then more specifically, if you can, just given all the comments about inflation and specifically the labor environment, what exactly are you seeing there? And just both on the availability of literally being able to get feel and then is the cost of those individuals? Tom Fanning : Yes. I think simply, Dan can fill in some blanks here. But Unit 4 remains on-track with our expectations. We are consistent with our expected timeframes and budgets, all good in that regard. I think we gave you the data that suggests that the 0.9% kind of average monthly increase in construction is consistent with a September timeframe and is, in advance of better than the 0.4% that we need to hit the year-end. So that's your three-to-six-month stuff.  Importantly, as we said in the script, I just want to make sure you know, all of our production for Unit 4 is consistent with our expectations. We are moving people from 3 to 4. And so, we expect their productivity and their production to increase overtime. So consistent with our estimates we need to increase. We have plans to move people over to effectuate that increase. With respect to the inflation and pay, we frankly went over that here getting ready for this call. We believe we're still top decile pay for the Southeast, and we feel like most of that risk is behind us. Dan, do you want to add anything else? Dan Tucker : Yes. The only thing I'd add -- you hit on this briefly, but we do have a very detailed plan for transitioning, particularly the electric craft from Unit 3 to Unit 4 as we go through this process. And then as you'd expect us to do, we're certainly applying every lesson learned from Unit 3 to Unit 4, and that will also factor into our ability to increase productivity. Tom Fanning : One last point there. Attrition is at normal levels. So it's progressing as we expected. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you, guys. And then just if you can comment here on the tender timeline with the co-owners, that looks like it's coming up here in mid-June and mid-August. How should we think about the timing for resolution of the disagreements around the baseline costs, COVID cost, before that window opens in the middle? How will that resolution be communicated? And what are your expectations today? Dan Tucker : Julien, I don't want to dive too deep into this. That's a conversation that frankly just needs to take place in the right form with us and our co-owners. As Tom mentioned in our prepared remarks, these are partners that go back with us decades and we have a track record of resolving any sort of disagreements constructively. We'll let this play out over the course of the year. The timeline you referenced it was a 180-day clock that started back in March just to, kind of formalize that. That's certainly a backdrop to these discussions. But let's let that play out on its own throughout the rest of the year. Tom Fanning : Yes. And you should know that this is not a discrete kind of engagement we have with our co-owners. I was with them last week at the site. You should view us as having a real-time conversation here. Anything else, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I got more, but I'll let other folks jump in here. But thank you, guys. Tom Fanning : All right. Feel free to jump back in, if you like. Thank you for joining us. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good luck, guys. Tom Fanning : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hi, everybody. Hi, Tom. Hi, Dan. Tom Fanning : Let me -- before you get to your call, I just want to complement you on your call to action here. I thought that was really well done. Good job. I'll share that with our folks as well. Steve Fleishman : Of course. So now that you brought that up, I'm curious if anybody is actually -- if you're hearing anything out of D.C. that would suggest that anybody actually might listen and act on, I guess, BBB slim down or other -- just energy policy. Tom Fanning : Well, I'm sure you didn't see my little comment on Squat Box this morning. But I think one of the headlines out of the media was essentially unleashing -- let me just make sure I get it here, the United States needs to unleash the American energy economy. We have been having conversations with people like Gene McCarthy and Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm and others. Listen, this is a constant conversation. Senator mentioned I think, has lots of good ideas. I think the challenge that we see in D.C. right now is essentially deal service. How do we get the right number of people to agree on the right number of issues and get it done in a time frame that is enough in advance of the November elections to be constructive. Listen, I think people get the issue and Steve, now more than ever. When we see Russia weaponized its energy policy, it's time for the United States to take action. Steve Fleishman : Okay. I hope they do. So second question, just maybe related, you're one of the companies that still has a pretty good mix of gas, still some coal, renewables, nuclear and just -- I know you have that data set that you put in your slide deck on just showing the mix and you had pretty consistent metrics a little more renewables, even though gas has moved up a lot in price. So maybe you could just give some color on just why not seeing more switching away from gas. Tom Fanning : Well, I think \u2013 I think it\u2019s a little\u2026 Steve Fleishman : We see more call\u2026 Tom Fanning : Yes, man. This may be -- I don't know the full data set for our industry. But we've always had this constructive relationship with our state regulators. And a long time ago, we put in a place -- put in place hedging programs. And so in effect, I'm going to say about -- and Dan correct me, about 30% of our natural gas consumption was hedged at about $3 per million Btu. So when you think about the dispatch curves, they're probably better than what you might have expected because of that hedging program. And of course, as we pointed out, lots of times over decades, all of these benefits accrue to our customers. We make no profit percentage off of any of this. Dan, anything else? Dan Tucker : Yeah, a couple of things. So one thing that is occurring, Steve, is we are being a little conservative might be the right word in terms of looking towards our peak season in the summer in our electric business and just making sure that we're holding on to enough coal there as well. So there are times when we're we might have otherwise switched the coal but because we're looking ahead. And what's behind that, and I think you may have touched on a little bit of this in your report, transportation of energy is one of the things that is certainly a hot topic. And frankly, we don't have enough of. People talk a lot about natural gas pipes on coal, it's obviously with the rails. And with the lack of available personnel and other things, rails are having to reprioritize their own train sets and personnel and frankly, coal is not at the top of their list right now. And so we're just having to be thoughtful about how we do that. Tom Fanning : The good news there is that the flagship, if you will, of our coal units is Plant Miller in Alabama. It is the cheapest best controlled plant, it has plenty of coal for the summer. So that one is in good shape. The other thing that I just want to make sure people here loud and clear. In no way does this negatively impact our long-term objective of achieving net-zero by 2050. You have to understand that long-term strategy should be robust and be able to manage the exogenous factors that change our plan day-to-day. Mike Tyson, you have a plan until you get hit in the face and then what happens. Certainly, the tactics will vary depending upon what's happening in the worldwide energy market. But our long-term strategy remains intact. Steven Fleishman : Great. One last question separately on Vogtle. And so when you made the update at year-end to the schedules, it mainly seem to be related to the paperwork issues with the electrical contracting, which seems to be getting resolved. So other than that issue, is there anything else that we should be most focused on in terms of getting to the goal line of fuel load? Tom Fanning : Yeah, you bet. So if you \u2013 if I could change your question, but it's a similar question. What am I most worried about right now on Vogtle 3 in particular? I would say that the ITAAC situation looks pretty manageable if you just do the math that we gave you, 53 remaining ITAAC and you think about needing 30 to 40 to finish, that effort that will occur in a fairly lumpy fashion right as we file the request for the 103G letter. It looks pretty manageable. And so my sense is the ITAAC situation getting to 103G always hard. We take nothing for granted. Certainly, there's a variable in time and how we're going to do those things. But I think that looks like it's in pretty good shape. I am more worried now about the work that has to happen between today and fuel load. Now that covers a lot of different things, they're not nearly as kind of nuclear safety related as the 103G obviously are. But it would include things like, and I'm just giving you a sample, but the fuel transfer system, aligning the electric buses throughout the plant, general demobilization efforts, things like removing temporary lighting and putting in permanent lighting, removing scaffolding, closing the rooms, cleaning them and closing them, getting ready for a pristine operating condition. So that's a lot of stuff that still has to happen. I think, a few system turnovers for that. I think two left. There's just more work to be done. I think that is more of the critical path right now than probably 103G. And then the next thing that I would say, I worry about will be from fuel load to operation, just thinking about fully operating the kind of follow-on steam cycle and making sure that the digital controls are integrated together, as well as they can be. Those are the big things in my mind right now. Dan, do you want to say something? Dan Tucker : Yes. I think it's important to understand, as you hear Tom describe what necessary to get the fuel load and the things we're focused on there, that is largely concurrent work with the work we're doing to get to 103G. It's not sequential. It's not get to on first and then to the other. We're doing those things on parallel paths. Tom Fanning : Yes. And that's what I tried to be pointing and say now to fuel load. And the other thing that we have done, we brought a guy to the site, Pete Sena, who is our Chief Nuclear Officer, he runs our fleet. And so, we've added another senior member to the team, as we think about moving from a construction environment to an operating environment. Steve Fleishman : Great. I remember him from PSEG. Great. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Thanks, Steve. He is terrific. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. You may proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey Angie, always glad to have you with us. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Thanks for having me. So, I'm just wondering if you could give us any sense of what to expect from the upcoming rate case in Georgia and also how this new commodity price environment might have changed the perception of your nuclear plant under construction, both for the regulators, politicians in Georgia and the co-owners of the project? Tom Fanning : Yes, Angie, you know, having followed us for many years, that we're not going to get in front of anything to do with the regulator. So we'll make our filing and when we make our filing right at the end of June, we'll certainly reveal all of the issues, I think, in the rate case. So, I think it's fair to say, though, that the issues in the triennial rate cases as they have been in past really since, gosh, I don't know, boy, what was it about -- 1995, I think is when we first filed our Triangle [ph] rate cases, especially in this case, it will cover issues separate from Vogtle.  And so, I think they are more of what I would call meat and potato issues about how system is running. And I would say, we've always been treated fairly. We have a constructive relationship. And whenever there's a sticky issue that arises, we work it out. I think you should just expect that same kind of process to continue. Dan Tucker : Yes. I would think about it, to a large extent, a lot of the capital items, in particular, are a continuation of programs introduced in the 2019 rate case, things like grid investment and Ash PON programs. So, you'll see those carried forward, just updated. A \u2013 Tom Fanning : Yes, but you won't expect any curve policy here. This is normal stuff for us. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then on the appeal of Vogtle now that's \u2013 there's this global recognition that there has to be more of a diversification of power sources and that gas might not be the answer for everything. Tom Fanning : Absolutely. Angie, look, when you think about the energy dispatch price of Vogtle, it's going to be at about $1 per million BTU as compared to, say, a $7 dispatch price or even higher potentially of the gas fleet. Look, this thing from a dispatch standpoint is going to look like a champion. And by the way, it's carbon-free. And by the way, it's going to be probably the most reliable and safest plant. I don't want to be hyperbolic here, but it's going to be a really good asset for this state, for the Southeast and for the nation. Look, I think we are all feeling very good about its positioning in the future transition of the fleet for the Southeast. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then just one last question. I saw some comments in your 10-K about it, but can you talk about the sourcing of uranium and nuclear \u2013 well, nuclear fuel in general, so processing enrichment and how it's dependent or not dependent on any director or indirect sourcing from Russia? Tom Fanning : Well, you answered your own question. I think our \u2013 we moved away from Russia as a system some time ago. And we're so glad we did. We have no exposure to Russia. Angie Storozynski : Not even through like indirect exposure to 10x? Tom Fanning : No, not \u2013 no. I've pushed on that question with our folks many times now. And we think we're well insulated from any Russia problems. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may proceed with question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Shar, you are back. Shahriar Pourreza : I am sorry about that. I got all excited that, I hung up. My apologies. Tom Fanning : Not nearly as excited as we are. Shahriar Pourreza : There you go. There you go. Thanks for getting me back on. So Tom, I am just curious, when you're looking at the Georgia IRP, there's obviously a fairly healthy mix between gas, solar and storage. And essentially, all the coal has gone besides the plant. We're supposed to get a PD with the circumvention tariffs, I think, in August and it goes through a period of \u2013 of rule making, which is about a month after the PSC decision with the IRP. So I guess, how are conversations going with stakeholders in light of this tail risk, which could cause some pricing uncertainty for some time? I mean, could we see the IRP maybe shift out pending visibility with the circumvention tariffs, investigations? Tom Fanning : That's a fascinating question. The IRP is on its own schedule, and I think it's supposed to be resolved somewhere in July, August time frame. I have not heard anything. This recent news about the circumvention investigation is really interesting. And I know some of my peers have had a lot to say about it. My only comment on that, Shar, is given a lot of my experience in national security issues, it's my firm belief that if somebody is circumventing tariffs illegally that they should be held to account. The United States needs to protect itself from an economic standpoint in this global economy. So let the investigation run and let\u2019s see what happens. I think here, again, it's a conversation between tactics and strategy. In the Southeast, it is clear to me that solar is a dominant renewable strategy, in the long run, despite any perturbation that we may see from this investigation. I think we stay the course there. Dan Tucker : Yes. And Shar, you asked the question in the context of the current IRP. I wouldn't overlook anything to this one. The nature of the IRP process in Georgia is very long dated. It's really if you go back to the 2019 IRP, there are RFPs being executed today. And there are -- as a matter of fact, last week brought forward to the Georgia Commission, was seeking approval to defer some of the PPAs in the last IRP out a year, and that was approved. And it's tied in to not directly to the circumvention issue, but the general supply chain constraints in the solar space. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it, got it. And then, obviously, there's -- we're still waiting for the Alabama IRP as well. But you put the Georgia opportunities plus Alabama and Southern Power. It's a lot of capital that we're going to be potentially thinking about, even post Vogtle generating an electron and the cash flows that come with that. So, maybe, just highlight how you're sort of thinking about financing that incremental CapEx that can come from the IRPs and opportunities with Southern Power. You already kind of optimized an asset. But, I guess, I'm curious as we're thinking about the next leg of CapEx, especially post Vogtle, how you're thinking about sort of the regional footprint, the mix? Tom Fanning : Yes. Shahriar Pourreza : Is there opportunities beyond just straight equity or equity-like instruments? Thanks. Tom Fanning : Well, so let's first baseline what is CapEx? I feel like I'm on Jeopardy here all of a sudden. But, I guess, our official five-year budget assumes $41 billion, round numbers. I personally think it's higher than that, because I think, Dan, you demonstrated this in the last call. We typically understate our forward capital requirement, because we're conservative by nature, because we don't account for anything in our budget that we don't know about. In other words, we don't do placeholders. When I think about what that number may be, I could easily see something like $45 billion. Who knows, $9 billion a year, round numbers. And some of that may come from new generation, or things that may start to occur in the kind of late 20s that may start showing up maybe 2025, maybe 2026 time frame. So those would be the years that I would think you would see additional capital. I'll let Dan argue with me here, but I don't see the need to issue any equity during this time frame. Last point I will make. You have seen -- in the world of M&A, you have seen us not only do acquisitions, we also do divestitures and asset sales. It is important for us to always put our assets in the hands of the best owner. If that means we create -- if we do that well, we create the maximum amount of value to shareholders. If we see opportunities in the future to do stuff like that, we will do it, buying and selling, but we have no plans at present. Dan Tucker : I have no argument to anything Tom said. I would just reiterate, we don't foresee any equity needs at the top of your outlook, even with the upside on the tailwind. Shahriar Pourrez : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, guys. Congrats on the execution. Sorry about that technical glitch earlier. Tom Fanning : No sweat my friend. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Michael. How are you? Michael Lapides : I\u2019m fine, Tom. Thank you and thank Dan for taking my question and Tom, this one is more of a macro one. It's an industry one. It's probably even a heck of a lot bigger than just our industry here. Given all that's going on in the world, given some of the stuff that came out a few months ago regarding a nuclear plant in Kansas, just curious how you and how industry leadership and how the Board thinks about cybersecurity and managing and investing around the cybersecurity risk that exists today? Tom Fanning : Well, we think is enormous, and we are so lucky to have people on our Board that are well steeped in it. I mean we have former Secretary of Energy, Ernie Moniz, we have Dale Klein, former Chairman of the NRC. Kristine Svinicki, former Chairman of the NRC. All these people have classification status to be able to play in this information in an unfiltered way. You all obviously know my role. I've led the utility industry for eight years and turn that over to my good friend at Berkshire Hathaway, Bill Furman, and now I chair the CISA Advisory Board. Listen, this is an enormous issue. I was the only CEO private citizen on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. As I walk the halls of Congress, which I do as frequently as anybody, I guess, it's clear to me that there is bipartisan recognition of the importance of this issue and what we need to do about it. Unfortunately, there was no playbook. When the Cyberspace Solarium Commission came out with its report, I think it's been universally adopted in Congress. Of course, not every chapter was agreed to, but 70% of that commission's recommendations are now in law. And I'm so glad now that I get to help in operationalizing, primarily now with CISA and elsewhere with our own industry. But making this stuff come to fruition. The United States is making enormous strides and making ourselves safer. We will only do that as we reimagine the role of the private sector in preserving our national security. I think we're making terrific progress with that. And I want to give two shout-outs. First one is Jen Easterly, She's the Director of CISA. She does just a terrific job operationalizing the nation's cybersecurity agency. And then our National Cyber Director in the White House, Chris Inglis, just a brilliant guy in my wandering around before the Solarium Commission became to fruition he and I got together, and I found a real thought partner in how to advance the nation. Look, we have talent on our Board. We have talent inside the company. And I think the nation is operationalizing a real plan to make our national security better than it ever has been. A whole lot more to go, but man o man, as a nation we're better off than we were five years ago. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then a regulatory question, Tom, and thank you for that insight because over time, that's probably going to be -- I can almost guarantee it's going to be an issue that's discussed more and more frequently as generations past. I got a regulatory question. I'm trying to think about the bill and the changes in the bill in Georgia. So you'll file the GRC in the next couple of months, new rates probably early next year. And then a few months after that, the Vogtle Unit 3, if it goes in service as planned, those rates will kick in. And then fast forward to the fall of 2023 beginning of 2024 time frame, the Unit 4 rates will kick in. Am I thinking about that right as kind of a progression of events of changes to the customer bill, irrespective to any changes in the fuel cost? Tom Fanning : Yes. I'm going to let Dan hit kind of the specifics of that, but let me just say too, we still are committed to bringing the Vogtle Units in at or cheaper than what was originally discussed when we received the order on those units. So I think we're still in at less than 10%, which is a big deal. Dan Tucker : Yes. Michael, you described the cadence of those increases exactly correct. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. And then finally, can you just remind us the changes in the fuel cost? I'm just trying to think about what pattern the customer bill? How do you look at what's going on across the southern companies, meaning Georgia, Alabama, et cetera? What's happening in the customer bill relative to what you're seeing elsewhere in the country? Tom Fanning : Look, first of all, we're starting from a great spot, I mean, overall, our rates relative to the national average bounce around anywhere from 10% to 15% below national averages. So we're starting from a good place. We've got incredibly constructive mechanisms that help not only capture what's coming, so it's all forward-looking mechanisms that are also very kind of the cadence of them is thought out very well. Michael Lapides : Got it. Tom Fanning : Make moving, Michael. Yes, you bet. Michael Lapides : No, go ahead, I didn't mean to cut you off, sorry. Tom Fanning : That's right. I was just going to say more broadly, look, we are working every day internally to keep cost down. We've got coal plant retirements coming up that will help keep O&M down and customer bills down. We're working to be more efficient in lots of different ways, turning capital into O&M savings, whether that's enterprise systems or whether that's the things we're doing the grid investment plans. And so it's not one or two things. It's being very comprehensive in how we approach not only operations our regulatory plan. Dan Tucker : Let me also just weigh in on the market structure issue. I know there are some with parochial interest in my opinion that are arguing for increased deregulation disaggregating the make moving sales structure that we find integrated in the Southeast to be so valuable. When you think about winter storm Yuri, when you think about resilience, value is a function of risk and return, I'm afraid some of these so-called organized markets have structured around preserving somehow the lowest price. Well, yes, they get low prices from time-to-time, but they also get a tremendous amount of volatility and no regard for reliability and resilience. In the Southeast in our integrated regulated market, there was one throat to choke, and it is ours. Make move or sell, we are accountable to the commission and the customers and the markets we serve. In our opinion, advancing to net zero, providing resilience, providing the lowest price to customers irrespective of where commodity prices go, Recall, we don't have a profit motive in rising and falling energy prices. We pass those along to customers at cost. This is the right market structure to pursue. And anybody that says different is misguided. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thanks Dan. Much appreciated guys. Tom Fanning : You bet. Always good talking with you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey Jeremy thanks for joining us. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, thanks for having me. Good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to Vogtle, real quick, if I could, and maybe better understand the ITAAC. A lot was completed in the last few months. And I just want to better see, I guess, what the drivers were, with the cadence where it's less in May and then kind of steps up into July, as you said a lot right before the end. Is there like a degree of difficulty difference in these versus the others, or just any other drivers, I guess, for the lumpiness and the outlook there? Tom Fanning : No, it's really the nature of the work to perform. And I wouldn't say it's difficulty per se. It certainly has different time requirements. And like I say, the lumpiness is driven by the systems that will be completed right before we ask for the 103G letter. If I had to characterize those, I would say, of the 30 to 40, roughly half of that deals with our final electrical work, a quarter of it deals with ventilation systems and a quarter of it deals with, as you would expect, the final primary controls and monitoring systems. Once you finish that work, then you file your letter. It's just that as you do that work, it's just a big slug of ITaC that go out with it. Again, it's not a matter of degree of difficulty. It's more a matter of timing. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful there. And then I just want to pivot towards the Georgia economy. You had a lot of good commentary there as far as what's happening? You talk about the cargo levels and strong economic activity getting back to pre-COVID levels in the near-term. I'm just wondering, if you think about, I guess, the economic activity in your footprint going forward, maybe thinking more later dated, has it changed? I mean do you think that the growth is stronger now than maybe pre-COVID, or just from a big picture point of view, how do you think about the growth trends longer term in your area? Tom Fanning : Yes. And you should also, I think -- CNBC put my interview out on their website, so you can go look at it. What we have seen is a migration of people into the Southeast, particularly Georgia. I think Georgia has the fifth highest growing population in the United States. And there's this question of, well, are we going to have a recession? You may have a different way to ask the question, and that would be regional recessions, we don't see any data that supports recession in the Southeast at this point. Let me give you some other data it's just interesting. If you look at our industrial sales year-over-year, it was up 1.7%. I mean you guys know that's a good number, okay? But within that number, we're two of our three biggest single-site plants closed. One was a chlor-alkali plant and one was a newsprint plant. If you remove the effect of those plants from the new brander and denominator, our industrial sales were up over 4.5%. I mean, that's amazing stuff. So, I think, especially as Dan suggested, with the ports, you see the unwinding of supply chain, you see the migration of people in, you see the low unemployment rate. I think the chemicals are in the sea for something to crawl up on the beach that will be sustainable and positive for years to come. And certainly, if there is a global downturn, and if there is a widespread recession. As we have seen in the past, the Southeast will be more resilient. The downturn will be less severe and the emergence from that downturn probably will be quicker. So I can't predict the future. All I can say is, relative to the United States, I love the organic economic growth in our area. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Mizuho. You may proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Paul. Always glad to have you with us. Paul Fremont : Always glad be here. A couple of quick questions. One would be the cable separation remediation work that you were doing on Unit 3, is that fully completed? And is that work required as part of the ITAAC process, or is that separate from the ITAAC process? Tom Fanning : Yeah, it is part of that process. And yes, it's still underway, but it certainly is winding down. Paul Fremont : So your expectation based on the time line that you put out would be that, that work will be completed before July, right? Tom Fanning : Yes. Everything that we're putting out is consistent with the time frames. We're in good shape there, I think. Paul Fremont : Okay. Tom Fanning : Is that your dog in the background? Paul Fremont : That is a Wimeranner, yes. Tom Fanning : All right. Nice dog. Paul Fremont : Second question, you had talked about thousands of documents potentially that you needed to locate. And this was around the time of the fourth quarter call, you said you had located 30%. Did I hear you right on this call that those documents are now either found or replaced? Tom Fanning : Its not so much found. Sometimes it was incomplete. Sometimes it was absent. We've basically wound down that work. There may be a few left to go but nearly all are done for 103G. And for those that are required to load fuel, I think we're 75% of the way there. So there's still some work to be done, but it's not associated largely with 103G. It's more associated with the work I described for fuel load. Paul Fremont : Great. I think that's it in terms of questions for me. Thank you so much. And congrats on the NRC. When is the final section report due out? Tom Fanning : Next week, I think. They've already posted some stuff on their website. So \u2013 and we've already had our debrief with the NRC. Paul Fremont : Great. Thanks. Tom Fanning : Thank you, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Hey, Nicholas. Thanks for joining us. Nicholas Campanella : Hey, everyone. Hi. Thanks for having me on. Really appreciate the time. I guess I just \u2013 I wanted to go back to Steve's question on just the comments on kind of running parallel paths with some of the remediation work and I know we're kind of waiting on the 103G, but as you get that 103G, like is the expectation at this point that you can move right to fuel load. Is there just really no more remediation that can be done? And it sounds like you're ahead of schedule on that front. So if that's the case, is there any reason why we shouldn't be kind of targeting the midpoint for COD on Unit 3? Tom Fanning : Yeah, yeah, Nick, there's more work to be done. You should not expect us to get 103G and load fuel immediately. There is more work to be done. So there will be some space in between, yeah, I know we have this chart that shows 103G letter received and start fuel load almost immediately. I would expect if I were you. If we got the 103G letter sooner, there would still be a gap of time to get to fuel load. Nicholas Campanella : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then I guess you talked about moving folks from Unit 3 to Unit 4 and broadly, are you starting to see lessons learned from Unit 3 to Unit 4 start to translate and bear fruit. Maybe you can kind of talk to that and that would just be last part of it. Tom Fanning : Yeah, sure. We absolutely are. In fact, we've resequenced some work. Some stuff we mentioned in the past was energization of the control room and things like that. We moved that out. We've really been focused. Early on, and I think it was really smart. The site wanted to fail fast, if you will. And complete testing as soon as we were able in order to learn from whatever problems that arose and then be able to apply them critically. Now that we have a set of learnings at Unit 3, I think we have a better sense as to how to proceed on Unit 4 incorporating those learnings. And so you will see that in the Unit 4 progression. Nicholas Campanella : Got it, got it. Okay. And then if I could just sneak one more in. The asset sales to the best owner commentary. You've been a large acquirer of LDCs in the past. There's clear interest from private markets. I know that there's no asset sales on the table today, but just how are you thinking about how the gas business fits into the overall Southern portfolio and your wider decarbonization goals at this point? Any comments there would be helpful. Tom Fanning : Well, actually, I think our gas business fits in well with the decarbonization. When you think about the whole effort of energy policy in America, we have to make sure that we balance all of the clean, safe, reliable and may be resilient and affordable objectives, okay? So you could say, oh, well, we should eliminate all natural gas appliances in a home, eliminate gas heating. Well, in Illinois, that makes no sense at all. Who could afford to do that? And the electricity substitution effects in places like Illinois make no sense compared to the economies that our customers get through gas heat and other approaches like cooking and others. So what we have to do is take into account the full range of impacts to customers, clean, safe, reliable, affordable. And we've got to come up with a global solution on how to achieve those objectives and achieve net-zero. I think we're doing that. I think the idea somehow that gas should go away in America is really foolish. Don't undersell the capability of American technology innovation in solving the problem of the future. And when I talk about a new relationship, where we want the Department of Energy broadly, the United States government to get in the boat with us to achieve this net-zero goal. Some of that may be funding more important net zero technologies, whether that's storage, whether that is carbon removal, whether it's new nuclear, you name it. We are, by far, I think, the biggest proprietary research and development shop in America. We're one of the biggest funders of a -- Former Vice Chair. We've had several chairs. I think Stan Conley [ph] is now starting his second chairmanship of that effort. I think we're by far the biggest energy partner in technology development with DOE.  Look, what we need to do with the nation is invest in technology innovation and solve these problems. Saying that, given today's state of nature, we can't do gas in the future is foolish, given the amount of gas, the plentiful supply and the geopolitical national security interest we have in providing that. And now that geopolitical interest is not just parochial for the United States, now that Russia has weaponized their gas supply to Europe, how can Europe ever feel secure and having them as a trading partner. We need to step up to the plate and help solve the global problem here. The old idea was that Thomas Friedman, the world is flat or whatever that is, the world is not flat. It's full of perturbation and we may see a new global economy emerge where there are countries that are aligned with our national interest and perhaps those that aren't. And we'll see how that evolves. But boy-o-boy, it's clear to me from a supply chain standpoint, commodity development standpoint, energy can be one of the most important economic development activities, the United States can do, not only to keep things cheap and plentiful here, but provide us national security around the globe. Q \u2013 Nicholas Campanella : Thanks for all your thoughts I will leave it there. Tom Fanning : Thanks Operator : Our next question comes from with Srinjoy Banerjee with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Tom Fanning : Srinjoy, great to have you with us. Srinjoy Banerjee : Thank you. good afternoon, guys. So a couple of questions just on the debt issuance side. For Southern Power, no debt issuance needs there, but some maturities coming up, so indicating deleveraging there. Could you remind us what the credit metric targets are? And then just thinking about the future for Southern Power, would we consider that a core part of Southern's broader decarbonization strategy? Dan Tucker : So on the debt, I wouldn't think about it as deleveraging per se, I mean we're maintaining kind of continuous metrics there. And so that was related to the second part of your question. We're targeting about a 22% FFO to debt over time. And so, we're simply as we're as we're getting the cash flow, we're retiring that debt and recapitalizing the business to support that. And then yes, on the second part. Look, the Southern Power has been and continues to be an important part of the family here. We've always kind of considered it a core business, and we'll continue to operate it that way. Tom Fanning : And its risk profile and its earnings profile is all consistent with what we think we have here, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparties, bilateral, minimal to no fuel or transmission risk, those kinds of things. Srinjoy Banerjee : Perfect. And then... Tom Fanning : Go ahead. Srinjoy Banerjee : Got it. And just one last one, just on Georgia Power issuance needs, I think that's still slated at $1.5 billion, just given some of the credit market conditions so far. Any thoughts on whether you would look at long-dated or more front-end maturities there? Dan Tucker : Yes, we don't want to front run anything that we might do in the markets there, Srinjoy. I mean, we're always looking across the curve, trying to figure out what fits best and we'll just -- let's wait until we come to market with that to see what we end up doing. Tom Fanning : And I'll just complement Dan's team. You look at our portfolio, I think we have it in the background material, but 18-year average life, 3.5 kind of average coupon. This is one of the more valuable debt portfolios in the United States. It is a real asset to us. Srinjoy Banerjee : Thank you very much. Tom Fanning : Thank you, sir. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Well, my only closing remark will be, thank you all for joining us. We're off to an awfully good start this year, certainly in our financials, in our base business, but also with plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We continue to work very hard to execute, happy so far this year. We'll continue to work hard for the rest of the year and bring this thing home. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings.  In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Thomas Fanning : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate provided last quarter. The economies within our Southeast service territories remain strong, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2022.  Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I'd first like to provide an update on the recent progress at Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. The projected completion timeline forecast for both units remains within the ranges we provided the last 2 quarters, although at the end of those ranges. At Unit 3, we continue to progress with all necessary systems turned over from construction to testing, all inspection records related to ITAACs complete and then submittal of 51 ITAACs since our last earnings call, including 2, which were just filed this morning. 2 ITAACs remain outstanding.  Concurrent with our final ITAACs submittals, we plan to submit the all ITAAC complete letter to the NRC for Unit 3. This submittal should position us for receipt of the historic 103G finding from the NRC a few weeks later, documenting that license acceptance criteria for Unit 3 have been met. Upon receipt of the 103G finding from the NRC, no further NRC findings are necessary for Southern Nuclear to load fuel or begin the startup up sequence.  Receiving the 13G letter is an important milestone, but there's still more work to do before we load fuel. In the weeks ahead, we will be focusing on testing and surveillance, demobilization, finishing work and documentation. To support an in-service date at the end of the first quarter of 2023, we will need to complete this work and load fuel by the end of October.  Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 96% complete and progress continues in advance of cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. Electrical production, in particular, electrical terminations continues to be a key area of focus. We continue to add resources on site for this work, and we have a plan for transitioning electrical field engineers from Unit 3 as we continue our focus on increasing productivity and ensuring first quality first times to support the upcoming testing and long-term operations.  Timely Unit 3 fuel load and start-up, along with a sustained improvement in Unit 4 electrical production over the next several months is necessary to support our December 2023 in-service objective.  Moving now to cost. At the end of the second quarter, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $39 million, including replenishment of contingency and estimated incremental co-owner sharing impacts. Contingency allocated during the quarter is primarily related to procurement activities for remediation and a revised resource plan for Unit 4 that reflects updated productivity assumptions and the planned increase in craft and support resources.  We're excited about the progress that we've seen at the site over the last several months and look forward to the transition of Unit 3 from construction to operations in the weeks ahead.  Dan, I'll turn the call over to you. Daniel Tucker : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter, with adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share, $0.23 higher than last year and $0.27 above our estimate. The primary drivers for the increases compared to last year and our estimate are higher revenues associated with higher usage, changes in rates and pricing and warmer-than-normal weather at our regulated electric utilities.  These revenue effects were partially offset by higher interest expense and depreciation, along with higher nonfuel O&M, consistent with the rising cost environment and our long-term commitments to reliability and resilience. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package.  Turning now to retail electricity sales in the economy. In the second quarter 2022, weather-normal retail sales were 2.3% higher than the second quarter of 2021. This increase reflects stronger sales across all 3 customer classes, as we continue to see expansion across our Southeast electric service territories. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of 12,000 residential electric customers and 7,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. We remain encouraged by these trends and are continuing to monitor the potential impacts of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook.  Economic development within our service territories remains robust, with Alabama seeing a 10-year high in jobs and capital investment announcements during the quarter, led by announcements from Hyundai, Novelis and Airbus. Additionally, recent electric vehicle plant announcements in Georgia from Hyundai and Rivian represent the largest economic development projects in the state's history. These 2 projects alone are expected to create nearly 16,000 jobs and over $10 billion of capital investment across the state.  As we highlighted last quarter, the Port of Savannah continues to show strength, with the container volume growth seen during the first quarter accelerating in the second quarter as a result of U.S. consumer demand and the diversion of vessels from other ports driving record cargo levels in June. We remain encouraged by the level of economic development within our service territories, and we continue to partner with each of our states to attract new businesses. With our solid adjusted results through the first half of the year, we are well positioned as we head into the peak electric-load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2022 is $1.32 per share on an adjusted basis. And consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter.  Before turning the call back over to Tom, I would like to briefly highlight Georgia Power's 2022 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission last week. Recall, Georgia Power files an IRP every 3 years, outlining the company's plan to continue delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers over the next several decades. The approved plan includes the addition of 2,300 megawatts of new renewable resources as part of Georgia Power's long-term plan to double its renewable generation by adding an additional 6,000 megawatts by 2035. The plan also approves the addition of over 750 megawatts of battery energy storage projects, the retirement of over 1,500 megawatts of coal by 2028, and the continuation of existing grid investment in ash pond closure programs.  Additionally, the approved IRP continues Georgia Power's hydro modernization program and authorizes initiating a license renewal application for Plant Hatch, each of which will extend the lives of these important carbon-free energy resources for the benefit of customers. The expected capital expenditures associated with approval of the IRP are consistent with the capital plan that we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.  Tom, I'll now turn the call back to you. Thomas Fanning : Thanks, Dan. For more than 5 decades, Southern Company's world-class research and development organization has remained at the forefront of innovation to build the future of energy today. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a couple of recent R&D announcements. Last month, Georgia Power and Mitsubishi Power, along with the Electric Power Research Institute, successfully blended 20% hydrogen fuel at Georgia Power's Plant, McDonagh, representing the world's largest hydrogen fuel blending demonstration project to date on an advanced-class gas turbine. This demonstration project helped pave the way for long-term clean and carbon-free use for existing natural gas-generating infrastructure. Additionally, in Alabama, Southern Company continues to manage the National Carbon Capture Center for the Department of Energy, which recently surpassed 128,000 hours of testing, and has expanded its focus on advancing carbon capture for natural gas-powered generation, carbon utilization and technology-enhanced solutions such as direct air capture. In fact, a low-carbon concrete technology developed by Carbon XPRIZE winner, UCLA and CarbonBuilt, recently achieved its first commercialization deal bolstered by successful testing at the center. We are proud of the legacy created by our R&D group over the last 50 years and look forward to continuing this important work for many years to come.  In closing, I'd like to take a moment to highlight Southern Company's generating fleet and power delivery system, which performed exceedingly well through June's extremely hot weather. During what was the second hottest June in 50 years, we were able to maintain sufficient generating capacity reserves across daily peaks, including 6 days, which peaked over 40,000 megawatts, and an all-time peak load of 41,376 megawatts on June 15. Delivering these results requires effective long-term planning that is best facilitated in a vertically integrated, state-regulated markets, coupled with real-time coordination between our plants and our system operators. And I'd be remiss if I didn't recognize the performance of our covered workers who, once again, performed during these times of duress in an exemplary manner. I'm proud of our team's continued outstanding performance during times when our customers need us the most.  Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll get to our first question on the line is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : So just got two quick ones for you, Tom. Just on the IRP, obviously, a decision on the Bowen plant was pushed out to $25 million do you sort of think is kind of the most viable pathway forward there at 1,800 megawatts, it's sizable. Can you convert it to gas? Can you get firm transmission on the pipe -- or if you went with more renewables, can you just maybe remind us of the amount of transmission you've said you would be needed and the time it would take to build it to make solar an option there just given that the plants in the northern location? Thomas Fanning : Shar, you hit the nail on the head. My overarching comment here is that our long-term strategy as a system remains robust and strong commitment to net-zero by 2050 is in place. I think the beauty of how we work with the commission and the staff and, frankly, all of our stakeholders is something that allows us to respond to the kind of exogenous factors that really impact us from a tactical standpoint. Obviously, fuel markets have changed, inflation has changed, supply chains have changed. And so I think the wisdom of the commission in this case is perfectly warranted in pushing that decision forward.  I don't want to certainly prejudge what we don't know at this point. But I will say the 2 options you outlined are very reasonable. One, is to think about keeping generation in the northern part of our state. You know that our big load sync is Atlanta. And so the Bowen unit historically have played a really important part in kind of balancing the load between North and South.  Were we to continue to shut down those units, you would need to think about replacement. Obviously, gas is an option North. More renewables North could play a role. As you know, our big answer on renewables across the system is most likely solar, not wind, just we don't have the climate to do widespread wind. And maybe these tall turbines will come to fruition or not, who knows.  So failing that, putting more solar in the south part of the state with a much better terrain does make sense. In order to locate more generation in the state in order to balance the needs in the North, we'll need to build significant transmission. The beauty of our market structure here is we are allowed to iterate among and between generation and transmission as an optimal portfolio solution. The so-called organized markets have difficulty doing that. So this is a topic of conversation. I think we'll handle it in the future. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Got it. And then just lastly, on Vogtle with sort of 8 months left to hit your Unit 3 target, you have 4 ITAACs, the NRC letter, likely doesn't seem like it's a major hindrance and then you have fuel load expected in November. Can you just elaborate sort of on those interim steps that you think could be more complex post fuel load, which still gives you about a 4- or 5-month cushion to hit your Q1 target date? I mean, I hate to say this, but can the plant actually be ahead of schedule here? Thomas Fanning : Yes. I would hate to say that. You would love to say that. Shahriar Pourreza : I don't want to get everyone excited. Thomas Fanning : Yes, right, right. If we don't either. We're guiding you all to say that we feel comfortable within the range that we've laid out, I guess, 2 calls ago. Let's say the schedule calls for completion by end of March 23. Here's kind of where we are. We have 2 ITAACs remaining, not 4. And I believe we'll finish those in days, not weeks. I think these things are reasonably imminent. Then we'll file concurrently for the letter requesting the 103G, letter to be issued by the NRC. We think the NRC has plenty of capability to handle that within their time frame, which I think is we've laid out at a max of 17 days.  Really, I think the greater pacing factor to fuel load is now not ITAACs, it is the rest of the work we need to finish on our own to begin fuel load and then begin the initial operation of the plant. As I mentioned before, and Dan can help me here, too, there are 4 kind of big categories we're thinking about in terms of the scope of that work. One is demobilization. The second is testing and surveillance. The third is just finishing the work that we already have in place. And then the final one we've talked to you about is documentation, getting the paper right.  Simple examples of some of those things, demobilization is taking down things like scaffolding, and taking any of the spare parts that we have laying around the site and moving those off so that, at the end of the day, the work rooms and everything within Unit 3 will meet nuclear standards in terms of operations.  Dan, do you want to add anything else there? Daniel Tucker : Yes. I think that's a great example of demobilization and scaffolding, temporary lighting is a similar example. Testing and surveillance activities and documentation, I think those are pretty obvious part of the finishing work, really gets to what Tom alluded to, but it's doing coatings, it is getting particularly containment to this pristine condition to get ready for fuel load. So it's those activities that, frankly, have a logical sequence to them, and it just takes time to work through. Thomas Fanning : And now is the time to do that work. There's nothing unusual about the work ahead, we needed to finish the safety-related ITAAC, and now we finish that stuff. Look, the whole exciting transition we have here is moving this plant from transition to operations, and we have line of sight to that now. Operator : Our next question on the line from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Tom, good to hear you. So just kind of a last second question here just since we just got this potential new inflation reduction bill. Any thoughts on you've been very right about this not happening, and now certainly, there's a chance that it might. Just do you think this now can happen that Manchin is on board? And then just implications for Southern across different ways that would impact you or your customers good or bad? Thomas Fanning : Yes, sure. You bet. Let me give you the -- it's all good. Let me go back to what I said before. I never say it wouldn't happen. I said the deal physics were hard. And let's just kind of replay the cards as we've worked relentlessly on the hill, whether it's Congress or in the administration and, frankly, our stakeholder groups, environmental, et cetera, the deal physics were getting tough because we were entering this period of inflation. And I won't say senator Manchin had his eye on inflation a long time before a lot of other people did.  And so the idea of spending more money in light of inflation pressures, and I guess the latest announcement was 9% or so, is really something that is concerning. And so the way that you get to promote this kind of bill is to include within it, pay-fors that will offset whatever inflationary pressures may arise from the increased spending. And as you can see from the proposal right now, and let's leave it as a proposal, there's an additional, I don't know, $300 billion of pay-fors. So hopefully, it speaks to the need to not make this an additional log on the inflationary fire.  The second kind of interesting exogenous variable is a specter of a recession. And I think what has been concerning many people is that adding taxes at this time may be another domino to fall that may increase your likelihood of entering into a recession. Now we've just heard this morning that the United States is in technical recession that is 2 GDP quarters negative in growth. But if you look at our numbers, and I leave this to Dan or whatever, who kind of did a nice summary in the script, we're not seeing any indicators of recession right now. But certainly, the historic numbers that bring us up to date for the quarter are way better than what we expected.  Further, when you look at the data Dan referenced with respect to our headlights, if you will, our economic development activity, you're talking over 300% of job growth in the backlog, and you're talking nearly 700% of capital investment. And you're talking about things like Rivian and you're talking about more EV development, and you're talking about data centers. We don't see the specter of a recession right now. Now I'd like for Dan to comment a little bit. He does his economic roundtable, just got through with it. Other people are seeing some reasons to be cautious. And maybe that's cautious in the first part of 2023, Dan, why don't you give us a burst on the roundtable. Daniel Tucker : Yes. So just as a reminder for folks, we've done this for over a decade. And what we do a couple of times a year is bring in folks from regional universities, large financial institutions and then, frankly, a lot of representation from a cross sector -- or a cross-sector representation from our customer base. So we had railroads in the room. We had manufacturing companies, ones that get involved with housing. We had consumer goods across the board. And to Tom's point, there was this backdrop of, yes, a recession is looming, but a very clear acknowledgment that what you may find yourself in is a place where there's very clear geographic or regional differences as you enter into that period and endure it. So Tom is right. Everything we're seeing provides a lot of tailwinds for us. We're in terrific shape. Things could certainly change. But everything we see now every indication, and if you look at Slide 10 of our deck and how sales manifested during the quarter relative to what we expected. We're in terrific shape. Thomas Fanning : And even those industrial results, Dan, included 2 pretty big plant closures, one Olin Chemical and the other one was... Daniel Tucker : Resolute, a newspaper manufacturer that was in Georgia. Thomas Fanning : And so absent those guys, [indiscernible], I mean, it would have been certainly higher than 3.7%. The momentum numbers look good. So we just don't -- the data doesn't support a recession, all right? Now we raised the issue on the last call in light of the recession that there may be the likelihood of a national recession where the Southeast remains robust and growing. So we just don't see that right now.  Now, I will say, we do see inflation and particularly in the food and energy markets, and that hurts our customers. So this is not an environment without duress? And it's those factors, I would say, inflation and potential for recession and what the other exogenous variables may be? I mean, what is the future of Ukraine? And what is the unwinding of the supply chain from and how will that visit the United States in the future are all key variables. What has changed a bit has been this narrative of, are we really in a technical recession? Does that really reflect the strength of the economy? There's pretty good arguments on each side. I would argue that the Southeast, given our strong foundation, is going to be better able to weather this than many places else in the United States.  I think the conclusion of the people that have come up with this legislation is also that this is an inflationary by its structure and the tax increases, which don't impact us very much, and I'll speak to some of the pieces of this legislation and how in respect Southern, probably aren't going to be enough to tip very further into recessionary territory. They tend to believe more of the qualitative not the quantitative story.  With respect to Southern, good having -- this looks really good. When you look at the energy security and climate change pieces of the legislation, the $369 billion or so, it's very helpful to us. You know that the move from investment tax credit or production tax credits is very favorable. To us, our favorite kind of renewable over the years, we call it one time, we were the largest owner of solar in the United States. We've recycled some capital. I never particularly like having to live off the ITC characteristics. So moving to PTC is really a good thing.  And when you look at the Georgia IRP, solar plays an important part in our future. So that's really good start. Recall also our R&D for storage. We've already mentioned our importance of carbon capture science. So the 45Q credits are great.  Here's the big thing, though. If I had to write a headline on all of those benefits, I would say that this is really beneficial to our customers and should reduce the cost of the transition from the fleet today to the net-zero long-term strategy in the future. There are some other things in there that are kind of attractive. The tax credits in there for purchase of electric vehicles, whether they're used or new. There're some other things in there for hydrogen, a variety of other things.  So what about the negatives? What about the pay-fors? If you look at kind of the list of that leading the charts is this 15% corporate minimum book tax. I'll probably leave this for the guys in the boiler room after the call, but I am prepared, Steve, with examples that will show you that the difference between tax taxes and book taxes to us is almost nothing.  A company as big as ours with $23 billion of revenue and all that other stuff, the difference is in taxes paid is just really small like 0.5% kind of as an estimate. It's almost you can't see it, $5 million, $10 million. It's almost nothing. Now of course, as that travels over time depends on a host of factors. But to us, this alternative book tax just doesn't have a material impact to the company, okay?  It will be interesting to see what happens on the prescription drug pricing reform and some of these other things. I just don't have enough there. And everything I should say should be underscored with the admonition that we really haven't been through the 700-page document as thoroughly as we will. What we're giving you are our first thoughts on what it appears to be to us. Dan, do you want to say anything there? Daniel Tucker : No, I think we just see if Steve has any follow-ups. Steven Fleishman : Yes. I guess my one follow-up on this question would be, again, is your judgment, but you need every Democrat to support it to pass reconciliation just the likelihood that, I guess, particularly Sinema or the risk of someone falls off in terms of it getting done? Thomas Fanning : I think Sinema becomes a really important person now. I don't know how involved she has been so far on the creation of this agreement, frankly, between Manchin and Schumer. So her sense of this is going to be extremely important. And I know she's been very hawkish on raising taxes. So we'll see.  In the house, let's not even put that in the wind column just yet because I know that a lot of the House Democrats have had a lot of, I don't know, requests, desires for a change in tax policy, including things like a surtax on the wealthy, including SALT relief, the state and local tax relief. There's no additional taxes on small businesses. So there's a lot on the Democrat side in the house that's not in this bill, that still has to be negotiated. So we'll see how that goes. Operator : And we'll get to our next question on the line from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So if we can, just where the negotiations stand, the lawsuit filed by the co-owners playing into the timing of resolution here? I mean just you're previously pointing to the summer time broadly. I guess we're still in summer for resolution. But what's your expectation on that being extended, if you will, just to come back very squarely on this and sort of the parameters at this point? Thomas Fanning : Yes. Julian, I don't think we expect anything in the near term there. I think, as this plays out, I wouldn't be surprised to move to business court in Georgia, and the resolution could be second half of '23. I don't think we'll know anything in the near term. Daniel Tucker : Yes. The one near-term data point, Julian, is there is an August 27 date by which we'll know whether MEAG plans to tender their portion is what we've heard from [indiscernible] and MEAG still needs to work through their process and let us send one way or the other. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. That's more perfunctory. I understood. All right. Excellent. And then actually, -- let me ask you this. I mean, just how do you think about addressing the opportunity about owning renewables, whether through these RFP processes or just kind of stepping in at some point after RFPs have been awarded here to expand your ownership? And again, I get that you've got a certain allocation already in Southern Power, but is there any regulatory solution when you think about Georgia here that you could address or talk to a little bit? I think Shar was kind of alluding to it a moment ago. Thomas Fanning : Yes, man, certainly, going to the PTC, certainly makes it more competitive, more attractive for our operating companies to own this stuff. So that's really helpful. We're all in. And of course, Southern Power can compete for the new megawatts of particularly solar in the state. So on the margin, everything that we see in this potential settlement looks good for us. We're very happy with it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So perhaps the shift to really -- Go for it. Thomas Fanning : I would also say that we have been engaged in conversations in this. Like I say, I mean, with the administration, with any stakeholder, with Congress for months. So to the extent they arrived at a resolution, is it surprising? I don't know. I think it depends on how you view this inflation versus recession pressure issue. The pay fors certainly speak to the inflation. And I think the judgment on the ability of the United States economy to withstand the tax increases is really what's going to get us over the line. I just think, on the margin, this is good stuff for us. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And to be extra clear about this, the solar PTC sort of opens up the window of eligibility, especially given how punchy ITCs can be, not just for Southern Power, but more specifically here for Georgia Power. Thomas Fanning : It sure does. Daniel Tucker : Yes. For all of our regulated utilities, they're always going to make the economic choice for customers and what the PTC does is make cell phone that much more economic. So I think our competitiveness has definitely improved if this goes through. Operator : We turn the next question on the line is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I was wondering, just back on Vogtle, could you just talk a little bit about the labor backdrop maybe specifically on Unit 4? And if you're facing any labor tightness, any kind of turnover or churn issues there as you start to maybe ramp up and bring people back to that site and accelerate the work there? Thomas Fanning : In general, a lot of that goes to compensation. I think we're top decile. We measure ourselves all the time. And so the compensation issues are pretty well spoken for. I think you always have kind of a worry that as you finish conclusion of work that people will start leaving and go to other more sustained work. We're keeping our eye on that, and we think we have that spoken for. We measure our churn statistics virtually every day, report every week, and they're within our expectations right now. We are adding people to the site with relative ease.  I think the interesting issue there will be, you may remember us talking a lot about attracting electricians. We're able to do that now. I think the more important point for us is as we wrap up work on 3, it frees people from 3 to move to 4.  And it's not just folks that will do particularly these electrical termination. We're ramping that up in a big way. It's engineering and supervisory people that will make the increase in people on Unit 4 more efficient. Those are necessary to achieve the ramp-up schedule that we expect to see, oh, I don't know, over the next 10 to 12 weeks or so.  So that really is it. I think it's this idea of advancing on 3, freeing people up, moving those resources to 4 and increasing our productivity. David Arcaro : Got it. That's helpful. And I guess maybe any latest thoughts on a potential for a settlement around prudency or the time frame for when you might be able to start those discussions with other parties and intervenors here? Is getting closer to fuel load on Unit 3 is still the focus before that becomes maybe closer in time to being mixed up? Thomas Fanning : Settlement is always an option, but, boy, we don't want to get in front of that horse. We'll just let it go. As you may remember, the official schedule calls for prudence to begin on fuel load for Unit 4. And we kind of expect that in what summer next year.  So that's the official date to have a prudence hearing or begin that process. Yes, we could settle in advance of that, but I'm not going to front-run that issue here. Operator : And we'll get our next question on the line is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Good afternoon -- thanks for joining. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to touch on the guidance a little bit here, if I could. And just wanted to see any updated thoughts you have? I mean, just being so far ahead this past quarter, how do you see yourself positioned? Could the guidance raise be in the cards if things continue -- current trends continue? Daniel Tucker : Jeremy, this is Dan. So look, as we always do, we'll narrow down our year-end expectations during the third quarter call. It is clear that our year-to-date performance has positioned us really well to deliver strong results. But what it also does is position us really well to mitigate our operational and financial risk in future years.  So we're going to take every opportunity we have to fix the roof while the sun is shining, if you will. And if you look at our history of O&M spending in the electric business, there's almost never such a thing as a normal year. We build flexibility into our programs so that we can accelerate maintenance activities when we have higher-than-expected revenues from weather or customer growth or strong economic activity.  And then conversely, in those years, that inevitably happen where weather or economic activity are below our expectations or even recently a pandemic, we have the flexibility to curtail in those years knowing what we've done in years prior to get ready. Over time, this all balances out. And the system remains in great shape to serve customers, and our financial results are a lot less volatile than they might have otherwise been.  Additionally, and very importantly, many of our regulatory frameworks have backstops whereby better-than-expected results accrue to the benefits of our customers through the various rate or rebate mechanisms. So I would just say, stay tuned to the third quarter, but know that we're doing everything we can to improve and derisk future years. Jeremy Tonet : Yes. Got it. Sorry. Thomas Fanning : No, I mean just a little bit of clarity to that, too. It's inescapable. We're way ahead of where we thought we would be. I mean we, what, $0.37 up on the first 6 months. We're not going to be $0.37 over at the end of the year, right? That's what Dan is trying to say. I mean, I'd be disappointed if we weren't improved in the range or whatever. But we're just sticking with our practice of really giving you the firm guidance on our range in the next earnings call. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thomas Fanning : But the performance so far -- Yes, we're doing great. Jeremy Tonet : And then just one last one, if I could. And I realize that everything is new here. As you talk about the news last night out of D.C., but any thoughts with regards to regulated nuclear eligibility for PTC here that you might be willing to share with us? Thomas Fanning : Yes, it's slim. I think that language was designed to help plants under duress. Ours haven't been under duress. So I don't think it's a big deal. And recall that we already have production tax credits in place for Vogtle 3 and 4. So really, the application of Vogtle 1 and 2 fairly are hatch slim to none. That's our view right now. Operator : And our next question on the line from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Tom, Dan, a question for you. The McDonough discussion early in the call about blending hydrogen, Tom, can you just talk about both for hydrogen and your gas power plants, but also for RNG for your gas utilities, how should we think about what kind of the steps that have to happen, the big broad steps that have to happen for those to become decent-sized investment opportunities for the Southern family of companies? Thomas Fanning : Yes. You know what, but, I think that while some people have been breathlessly optimistic about hydrogen and I would argue we're doing the most research and the most kind of real money behind our words. We think hydrogen has a great place, particularly in blending with kind of methane fuels as we're demonstrating here in McIntosh. And then as we're looking at with the new plant that we may be building in Alabama to blend hydrogen, those are great applications, and we like them, okay? But I think the real issue in terms of near-term impact is going to be the classic chicken or the egg. Who's going to generate the hydrogen, and how do we move it?  Now we are doing also a lot of research on the gas side. So we're looking at, as we add safety-related pipeline replacement programs in Southern Gas, is it suitable to think about moving hydrogen through those facilities. We're certainly thinking about that. Michael Lapides : Got it. Daniel Tucker : Yes, I was going to say, Michael, just along the same lines as what we've been talking about on the call around renewables and what this agreement with Manchin and Schumer may -- how that may benefit renewables something similar may be needed for RNG since you asked about that, to make it equally affordable for customers. Michael Lapides : Yes. I was under the impression that there is an RNG ITC in this bill and -- but was just kind of curious for your thoughts about if there is some kind of tax credit for RNG, whether that's enough to make RNG really a material opportunity for the Southern Gas utility? Thomas Fanning : Dan, I don't know. We need to dive through the material. We're kind of looking at each other, going I don't know. Daniel Tucker : Yes. I mean when you said material, it's hard to see it being material in the near term. Thomas Fanning : Yes. I really think hydrogen is a good idea, but it's probably in the 30s. Operator : We can get to the next question on the line from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Nicholas Campanella : A lot of them been answered. I appreciate the updates. I guess just what's different about this quarter is you guys kind of moved off the ranges to target kind of specific quarters for in-service dates. So is that just kind of like the cadence of how you plan to kind of communicate ISD at this point? Or are you going to eventually kind of move back to a range on Unit 4? I think it's currently Q4 '23, if I'm not mistaken, for Unit 4 today? Thomas Fanning : We gave a lot of thought to that. We provided the guidance plus 3 months, plus 6 months. And as we look at the progress on 3, that has a lot to say about 4, okay? And let me give you an example. So as we begin fuel load and start-up of 3, the same kind of personnel that will be devoted to that activity will also be devoted to HFT in Unit 4. There can be overlap there, particularly, say, in the second half of start-up, maybe the last 25% of start-up. So let's just take a calendar. We've suggested that we could have fuel load before October. So that's -- and that would permit by March.  If the same personnel are starting to get freed up in the second half by February, by January, somewhere in there, that would suggest you could accelerate hot functional test on 4 from the calendar that we're showing you on Page 6. So all we're trying to say is the timing of 3 has a lot to do with the timing of 4. And to the extent we're successful on accelerating 3 prior to March, or have the people available at the end of startup of 3 prior to March, we can start hot functional testing sooner than the critical path we indicate on Page 6. That really is, I think, what is mostly behind our comments on schedule right now. Nicholas Campanella : Okay. Great. Yes. I just I wasn't sure if you just had like enough line of sight where you were kind of comfortable in like nailing down a quarter here. So... Thomas Fanning : Well, I mean I almost describe it this way. I think we got line of sight on 3. I think we have reasonable expectations on 4. We admit that there's lots of variables on 4. We'll certainly keep you abreast of those developments as they occur. Right now, we believe we're reasonably comfortable within the ranges. We are expecting an improvement in productivity on 4. So we'll be watching that in the very near term. We'll have more to say about that certainly next quarter. Nicholas Campanella : Okay. Got it. And then I guess when you gave these in-service date ranges, you also kind of talked about like $4 to $4.30 of EPS in 2024. Now that we're kind of at the end, does that guidance still hold here today? Daniel Tucker : Yes. Look, we are where we were, but the reason we put out a range, Nick, is because there's -- it was 3 years away, and there's a lot of moving parts. So, look, you see what's happening around inflation and interest rates. You see that we've got a significant regulatory calendar ahead of us. We recognized that there was a lot of uncertainty. And as those things get buttoned up, and we get closer to 2024, we'll narrow in on exactly where within that range we are. Thomas Fanning : Yes. But I think we're still within the range. The biggest change, I guess, Dan, that we see of interest rates, particularly cost of -- interest costs at the parent. But we'll certainly update that at our year-end earnings call. But I would say that it is a range, and Dan mentioned, we'll tell you where we are within the range. I don't see any reason to change it now. But within that expectation as a result of the Georgia rate case, anything to do with the economy, a recession, a host of variables. But everything we know right now, we're still within the range. Operator : And we'll get to our next question on the line is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : I wanted to go pick a brain just for a little bit more on the clean energy bill. So obviously, I mean, there's a lot to like here for utilities, generally speaking. But sort of when I compare this to sort of the build back better version of the plan, there's no direct pay for utilities, doesn't look like utilities are eligible for that. There's also no transmission investment tax credit as far as I can sort of see through the bill.  And then obviously, you have the 15% minimum tax, which you guys talked to is not a material impact for you, but EEI has visually kind of oppose that, if you will. So I'm just wondering that is there a chance for the industry or EEI broadly here to kind of influence certain piece of this legislation? Or is the process moving too quickly? Thomas Fanning : I think -- I'm giving you a complete judgment here, not fact, all right? My judgment would say that it's been so hard to get to this place. And there are still uncertainties out there, as I mentioned in response to Steven Fleishman's question. You don't have SALT relief in here. You don't have a surtax on the wealthy individuals in America.  There are things here that so many people wanted this thing -- and [indiscernible], there are still many unknowns as to whether we can get this across the finish line. This is a great thing for us, and I broadly would say for the industry. Adding something else at this point, I think, is a bridge too far, in my opinion.  And I think, the inside the beltway people are kind of talking to each other with the frame of mind that don't let the perfect get in the way of the good. This is pretty good, and we hope it crosses the finish line. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. And then just really quickly, can you just update us on the Georgia rate case filing? Just the milestones there, still expecting a final decision by year-end and kind of the key issues that investors now should be watching for? Daniel Tucker : Yes, Durgesh, again, we don't want to get ahead of any of the process. There is a calendar in the slide deck, Slide 25. So really, the process will start in earnest in mid-September with hearings. And yes, we still expect a decision by the September. I think the only other thing I would say is just as a reminder, this rate case is largely a continuation of all the elements of the 2019 rate case. It is carrying a lot of those same capital initiatives forward. It's not Vogtle. It's 2019, 3 years later. Thomas Fanning : What I'd add, reference the NERC report that warned the industry that half of the United States would be under duress with our energy future. And then you're stressed further by this unusual weather we're having, whether that's part of climate change, et cetera, the tails appear to be flatter, our system has performed beautifully. And I think, given our relative price position in the United States, given the resilience of our system, I think the decisions of the commission in the past and the company had been excellent in respect to benefiting customers long term here in the Southeast. And it's no secret why a lot of data centers in some of these big economic development projects, Rivian and others, are coming because of the price, because of the resilience, because of the long-term stability. Having this kind of constructive regulatory environment benefits long term the economic growth of the Southeast and that continues to look very robust. I don't see any reason why it would change at this point. Operator : And we'll get to our next question on the line from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : And I'm afraid I'm going to be following sort of Durgesh and Steve's approach here, just if possible. You made some comments about the new PTC and how you think it was -- it's designed for troubled nuclear plants? Did I -- could you elaborate a little bit on that? I mean I am unable to read all the legislative tech, but it looked to me like it was a little bit broader than that. And what you're saying makes logical sense. I just wanted to sort of get a better feeling to what you actually see happening there. Daniel Tucker : Yes. Again, so qualifying this, Paul, this is Dan. As it's 700 pages to get through and understand the details, and this is based on our high-level review of similar provisions in BBB. The legislation essentially sets an economic floor for nuclear plants. And so when you have a regulated nuclear plant that operates in a constructive jurisdiction and is recovering its costs on a regular basis, it's unlikely to truly benefit from something that's intended for troubled financially nuclear units. Paul Patterson : Okay. That makes logical sense. I just wanted to get a better idea. And then also just in terms of the mechanics, the 15%, I assume that, that applies to all corporations within that large category or what have you. And I'm just wondering, when did that be -- or am I missing something -- could that be a political problem for the legislation, or am I missing something there? I mean, you mentioned the SALT and all those other things that people -- I am sorry, go ahead. Thomas Fanning : No, I mean, I think you're absolutely making a good point. I'm telling you it's good for us. There will certainly be people in America that don't like this. I think NAM has already come out and said that this really hurt some of the people in manufacturing in the industry and you kind of expect this. Well, if it's good for us, who isn't it good for, and they certainly will weigh in.  And we'll see what impact that has. It is -- it must be at least a zero-sum game in order to be positive to the scorecard in Congress. So we're not hurt by it, other people are. I fully expect that it will provide headwinds to getting it done. We'll see if it's enough to sway some votes. I don't know. Operator : Thank you. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Thomas Fanning : Yes. This is an exciting time, isn't it? We've had a wonderful quarter. We've made great progress on the ITAAC. My sense is these, next 2 will be done in a matter of days, not months or weeks. And son of a gun, we're poised to turn this thing over to operations and look forward to fuel and so forth, that will remove a great deal of risk, I think, from our portfolio going away. But that does not mean that risk is done. We still have to complete the work necessary to fuel load. We still have to improve particularly our performance in electrical, particularly in the terminations area. We believe we have reason to expect that performance to actually happen. We'll know reasonably soon whether that's true or not.  So look, I think we're as well poised as we can be. Dan mentioned the blessing of the good performance that we've had to date, $0.27 over versus our own estimate, gives us the flexibility to deal with problems in the future, including rate pressure. So I like our cards here. I like the cards that are shown by the robust performance of the Southeast economy relative to the national economy. I know you all have to make your bets, and we have to do the same in terms of allocating capital. I think the allocation of capital from our own sense to our business model and going forward in this manner is really attractive.  So thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Look forward to our next call in October. See you soon. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Scott, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please, go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we'll provide non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter financial results continue to support our full year earnings objectives. And the economies within our service territories remain strong, including customer growth and economic activity that has outpaced our expectations. Given our financial performance through the third quarter, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share near the top of our earnings guidance range. Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I'd first like to provide an update on the recent progress at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion timeline and capital cost forecast for both units remain consistent with what we outlined last quarter. Since our last call, the site team has continued to make substantial progress on Unit 3, highlighted by the successful achievement of several major milestones, including submitting the all ITAAC complete letter, receiving the 103(g) finding from the NRC, which signifies that license acceptance criteria for Unit 3 have been met, and successfully completing the safe transfer of all 157 fuel assemblies from Unit 3 spent fuel pool to the reactor core early last week. Fuel load marked another historic and pivotal milestone towards startup and commercial operations. The focus over the next couple of months turns to final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electric power production side of the plant and achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for start-up activities. The next major milestone for Unit 3 is initial criticality or the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction, which is projected in January. Once this important milestone is achieved, plant operators can begin the prescribed testing sequence, which includes a series of power ascensions and reductions, various sustained power output plateaus and multiple forced trips to test the unit's safety systems. This rigorous process is intended to demonstrate the performance of the unit under a variety of conditions and its readiness to be included in reliable dispatch and to be placed in service for the benefit of customers. We continue to project Unit 3 will be placed in service by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Turning to Unit 4. Open vessel testing was completed in August and direct construction is now approximately 97% complete. Electrical production, in particular, electrical terminations remains a key area of focus. To support our projected December 2023 in-service date, recent electrical production levels must be sustained for several more weeks. Testing is expected to become the critical path as the project team progresses towards future milestones of cold hydro testing and the start of hot functional testing, which is projected by the end of the first quarter 2023. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you. Dan Tucker : Thanks, Tom and good afternoon everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share, $0.08 higher than the third quarter of 2021. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher revenues associated with increased usage and retail pricing at our regulated utilities. These revenue effects were partially offset by higher nonfuel O&M expenses consistent with the rising cost environment and our long-term commitments to reliability and resiliency, along with higher interest and share dilution from the mandatory conversion of our equity units. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to retail electricity sales in the economy. In the third quarter 2022 weather-normal retail sales were 1.8% higher than in the third quarter of 2021. This increase reflects stronger sales across all three customer classes, as we've continued to see expansion across our Southeast electric service territories. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of 11,000 residential electric customers and 8,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. We are encouraged by these trends and continue to monitor the potential impacts of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. Within our electric service territories, economic development announcements through the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, reflect a 170% increase in job additions and a 237% increase in business investment. Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2022. With adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.35, we expect to achieve adjusted full year earnings near the top end of our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. Our adjusted earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.23 per share. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you. Tom Fanning : Thanks Dan. We remain encouraged by the sustained level of economic development activity within our service territories as we continue a long legacy of partnering with each of our states to attract new business. In recognition of these efforts, Alabama Power and Georgia Power were once again named to Site Selection Magazine's top 20 utilities in economic development out of approximately 3,330 utilities across the United States based on capital investment and job creation activity. We are honored by this recognition and look forward to continuing our commitment to helping our states and communities attract and grow businesses to further strengthen the economies within our service territories for years to come. In closing, I would like to take a moment to highlight a significant safety milestone at the Vogtle project achieved this month, when the site successfully completed its 68 millionth job hour lost -- I mean, without a lost time incident, but 68 millionth job hour without a lost time incident. At Southern Company, safety represents a key tenet of our uncompromising values and this milestone is a testament to the project team's focus on creating a safety-first culture. I'd like to recognize Sean McGarvey from the North American Building Trades and Lonnie Stephenson from the IBEW, along with all of the thousands of individuals that they represent for their tremendous ongoing support at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. These groups have been terrific business partners for us, and the recent achievement of several major milestones is a tribute to the dedication of thousands of men and women committed to bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free resource for the next 60 to 80 years. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Tom Fanning : Hey, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Tom, I think you just got the fastest reward for the quickest prepared remarks. So that was good. Tom Fanning : Just got made by Vice President, give him all the credit. Shar Pourreza : There you go. Just quickly on the Georgia GRC, I guess, how are discussions going with intervenors? I mean, so the staff recommending both the 9.45% ROE as well as a reduction in the equity layer when Vogtle is fully in service seems somewhat counter to what we're seeing with capital market conditions and kind of the risks that are out there. I guess, what are your thoughts around a settlement and narrowing that bid ask, or do you think this case will likely go to litigated route? Tom Fanning : Well, you do know that this is an accounting order, is what it's been since 1995, which means it's not technically kind of a litigated kind of thing. You know that this process has been in place since 1995 and that it really is, I think, a process that has been proven, tried and true, to let every party have their say and have a constructive outcome. And I think we've proven that time and time again. Us commenting on any particular part of anybody's testimony at this point really isn't constructive. Let the process run and I'm sure we'll be treated in a constructive way at the end of it. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. Thanks. And then just on Vogtle, where do things now stand with the other co-owners in terms of resolving any sort of outstanding cost cap or contribution concerns? And I guess, what that ultimately means for your ownership of the projects and so on? Tom Fanning : I'll turn this over to Dan here in just some more details. But effectively, among and between Oglethorpe and Dalton and MEAG, we have reached an agreement, a settlement with MEAG. My sense is, Dan, you're not going to know anything else about the rest of these likely until the end of next year. Dan Tucker : Yes, that's right. And so the settlement with MEAG, you might see in the materials a slight cost revision for Georgia Power's ownership. And that's really reflective of that settlement. Our assumptions previously assumed, as many of you know, this notion of a tender or a put of ownership from any of the co-owners. And since that was not part of the resolution, we reached the kind of our estimate of the impact of the settlement is less than our previous estimate. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just lastly, I know you guys have previously talked about Georgia Power just not really being super competitive against third-party developers in terms of winning the solar RFPs. Sort of with the tax credit changes with transferability, solar PTCs, et cetera, that came with the IRA, could Georgia Power now potentially be able to compete and win a portion of the solar RFPs we're looking at that Georgia is going to be running? And then how do we sort of think about that versus what you assume in the current guide? Thanks. Tom Fanning : Credit to your question, is exactly right. Any differences we had were related to tax treatment flow through versus some sort of normalized treatment on the part of Georgia Power. It's interesting. I think during one of the early rounds in other years, we had developers take positions and then Southern Power actually came in and took them out of those positions. So, we could compete another way. My sense is the IRA is really going to be helpful to all regulated utilities that otherwise use normalized accounting. And it does put us much closer on an equal footing to those folks. The other thing that we always have to take into account, particularly with renewables that have distributed sites across our service territory is that Southern is reasonably well known for thinking about our expansion plan on a portfolio basis. Of course, each company reaches its own conclusion within that portfolio. But those kinds of considerations have to be met, especially when you consider wrapping into that, the closure of certain coal plants over time. So, we'll see how it goes. But I think overall, the IRA is really helpful. Dan, do you want to add? Dan Tucker : Yes. Shar it's important to think about this in terms of the planning horizon, right? So this is a longer-term dynamic. So, you're not going to see very much on the front end of the five-year plan. Those decisions have already been made. Those RFPs have already been executed for resources. So, you're really talking about the back half or even the last couple of years of our five-year forecast where this opportunity may manifest itself as potentially rate base assets. The other thing that is a new dynamic that's entering into the equation, certainly, affordability of kind of a low-cost profile is what this -- these tax benefits change. Other considerations will begin to factor in to some of these resources, location, how much the controllability of them and so, it's kind of the difference between the notion of lease cost versus best costs, where there's locational dynamics and other things at play. Tom Fanning : And every bit of the IRA to us, just serves to reduce the transition cost of our current position to a Net Zero future, all for the benefit of our customers. We don't make money off tax benefits. We typically flow them through for the benefit of customers. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific, guys. Thanks so much and see you in a couple of weeks. Appreciate it. Tom Fanning : You bet. Look forward to it. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Fowler with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open. Tom Fanning : Hey, Rob. How are you? Ross Fowler : Good. How are you? So just a couple of questions. One, election day is two weeks away, but we're not going to have a Georgia Commission election on that day. So can you just remind us what the process is from here around redistricting and how that actually works, whether it's a statewide or district election and how that would sort of proceed? Tom Fanning : Not figured it out yet. This is work ahead for the legislature to undertake, most likely through next year. Our sense is, this is not going to be something that's going to reach a conclusion anytime quickly. There's going to be a lot of debate and a lot of thoughtful consideration about how to put this into play. So really can't guess on it right now, and I really don't have an estimate on any time frame. Except my sense is, it's going to take some time. I don't think we're going to get a result anytime soon. Dan Tucker : And some of that time, maybe, because it becomes a bit of an iterative process between the legislature and the court. Ross Fowler : All right. Thanks, Dan. And then -- so the current commission would sit until that process was complete. Is that a correct a understanding? Tom Fanning : That's right. Ross Fowler : Okay. And then just maybe remind us as we're -- and congratulations on the fuel load, that's a big step. As we get to putting Unit 3, Unit 4 into service, how does the ROE penalties roll off over time and sort of, if Unit 4 is done on December 2023, then they're all -- there are no more penalties in 2024, if I'm thinking about it correct? Dan Tucker : Sure, Ross. So, again, as a reminder, all of our outlook assumes a total cost for Vogtle that goes into rates of $7.3 billion. And so the way that will break down in terms of rolling into base rates and thus, earnings or to power full allowed ROE, there's $2.1 billion that will go into rate base, the month after Unit 3 goes into service. And then the remainder, following prudence proceeding next year, would go into rates the month after Unit 4 goes into service. And so based on the current schedule, you'd be at Georgia Power's full allowed ROE on $7.3 billion for the full year 2024. Ross Fowler : And Dan, the penalties now pretty much put you into cost of debt, right, with the timing of how it's worked, right? Dan Tucker : The passage of time and increase in the cost of debt, we're essentially there. Ross Fowler : Okay. And then, the prudency process you mentioned, that starts on fuel loaded Unit 4? Dan Tucker : Correct. Fuel load. Tom Fanning : Summer of 2020. Ross Fowler : Of 2023 in the current schedule. All right. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Dan. Tom Fanning : Always good having you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. Tom Fanning : Hey Jeremy, how are you? Jeremy Tonet : Good. Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. You touched a bit on it before, but as it relates to IRA, just wondering, are there any other aspects to the bill that impact Southern that you could share with us at this point that you've determined. Clearly, benefits for the customer is very important here for other types of tax cuts beyond renewables. Would that impact Southern or minimum tax? Just wondering if you could share thoughts on the bill more broadly and its impact on Southern. Tom Fanning : The minimum tax thing really ended up not making much of a difference, particularly with the latest change they made. That doesn't impact us, hardly at all. This sounds like a policy response, but look, longer term, helping with 45Q and research and development and hydrogen, those are all good things that help us get from say we've already hit our 50% reduction goal. We put it in place in 2030. We hit it a decade early in 2020. Getting from 50% to 80%, we think we know how to do that, too. Getting from 80% to 100% is where these things that relate to innovation and research and development will be helpful. Obviously, those expenditures will happen before they're put into place. In particular, some of the things that we're interested in are this trade you make in the 30s and 40s between nuclear and combined cycle with carbon capture and sequestration. And certainly, in respect of the cost of adding more renewables is something we're focused on. All of those provisions as they're addressed in the build are helpful. Dan Tucker : Yes. And Jeremy, I'd say the other things that we're kind of exploring and trying to better understand and certainly waiting for IRS guidance is the normalization opt out for storage. That's something we're certainly evaluating how that impacts customer rates the transferability of these tax credits is particularly interesting, especially within Southern Power, where historically, we might have used tax equity. This creates a new, perhaps better dynamic in that regard. There's been a lot of discussion about the nuclear PTC. But we -- right now, as we sit here, based on our interpretation, I don't see that having any meaningful impact for us. But again, we'll wait for guidance on that and see how that turns out. Tom Fanning : Yes. And in general, what we really like about the idea of this bill is the structure that the credits are effectively technology neutral. And therefore, let the market work to show what is best in place for our customers over time. Dan Tucker : And the certainty that these are there for the next 10 years provides a lot of flexibility and planning and the way we think about our business. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's all very helpful. I just want to pick up with the part that you talked about nuclear there and saw during the quarter, there was a key milestone with Southern Company and Terra Power as it relates to their molten chloride pass reactor. And I was just wondering if you could provide us your thoughts as far as when you think that type of technology could come into play for utility scale proven up? What type of timeframe there and having the ability to ramp up and down quickly there, I guess, the benefits that could provide as part of the generation of fact? Tom Fanning : Yes. Yes. I would argue that the new nuclear future of America will likely start with SMRs. We hear a lot about people discussing putting small modular reactors into effect. I mean, that could happen last half of this decade certainly. The larger Gen 4 reactors that you're referencing to me are kind of mid-30s and beyond. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : We have a question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Arcaro : Hey, thanks so much for the time. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color around just the updates on Unit 4. The time frame didn't shift. Just wondering for additional color around how productivity has been relative to recent targets based on just eyeballing the green line and the red line. It looks like maybe even a little bit ahead over the last two months. And has there been increasing clarity with the progress that you've made on Unit 3 also as you look to Unit 4? Tom Fanning : Well, Dan, you and I should tag team this one as well. I'll start. We're gratified with the progress on electrical terminations. We've always called that one out as a risk factor. And so long as we sustain our recent performance on the site, through, say, November, then we're on track on that issue. So we're watching it very closely. We're gratified with the progress we've made. We just need to continue that progress. Obviously, as you've seen with Unit 3, our performance on these tests are particularly important. We believe that we've learned a lot from the test on Unit 3. And where we had some delays due to equipment issues or system issues, we think we've learned a lot, and we don't expect to repeat some of the issues that we saw in Unit 3 on Unit 4. So our schedule reflects that as well. Dan? Dan Tucker : Look, I think you hit the big issues. The testing will become critical path here for Unit 4 in the near term. And it is certainly predicated on those lessons learned and being a smooth process. And right now, the focus is getting the right people focused on Unit 4 in that regard where they've been tied up on Unit 3 completing that work. Tom Fanning : And all these discussions that Dan and I are referencing occur in a completely open and transparent environment. We have our co-owners with us. We have representives from DOE, NRC, the public commission staff, et cetera. I mean, everybody gets to hear all this information the same way. And I just think we're gratified with the progress we've made, and we see our way through to remaining comfortable with the time frames we're laying out. David Arcaro : Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then a separate topic. I was just wondering if you could touch on how you're managing interest rate headwinds right now with debt issuances coming next year, any ways to hedge against that proactively or other ways that you're looking to manage potential EPS headwinds there? Tom Fanning : Well, I will say this, old dog doesn't learn new tricks. Maybe that's not the right line here. But I'm an old finance guy, and I really like this stuff. I like liability management. And I can remember back when Drew Evans was CFO and we were in the low interest rate environment. We were very intentional about reducing, what I call, our level of risk capital. That's short-term debt, debt within one year, putable debt, all that sort of thing. So we shortened our risk capital. We lengthened the duration of our assets. And I would argue if we do this plot, I think it's in your package, but Southern Company debt portfolio when you look at kind of total enterprise value of a corporation is a really valuable asset. It's 18 years long on the average and has a really cheap coupon rate, 3.5% or whatever. These guys have done a really nice job managing it. Dan? Dan Tucker : Yes. So to Tom's point, we're starting from a great place in that regard. We've done things this year to take risk off the table, accelerating or upsizing some of our issuances, taking some of the variability out of the portfolio here in the short-term. We'll continue to do those things. And then look, already in 2022, interest rates certainly are having an impact on our results, and we've been able to offset that. We've got levers within the business to do that, and we'll continue to focus on those as we move forward. Like with anyone, I mean, we were fairly conservative about our assumptions over the long term. And like everyone, I'm sure our assumptions in the short-term were pretty far off, but we're managing through that. Tom Fanning : It's just another issue that we deal with. David Arcaro : Yeah. Great. No, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. Dan Tucker : You bet. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : We have a question from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dan Tucker : Hey, Nick. Hope you are doing great? Nick Campanella : I am. Thank you and hope everyone else doing good as well. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just to follow-up on the interest rate kind of commentary and I'm really just kind of thinking about through next year and the drivers of 2023. Not to get ahead of it, but could you just give us any kind of comments on how you're thinking about the growth rate into 2023? I know you've had this 4.15% marker out there for 2024. I think on previous calls, you kind of talked about bridging the gap to that 4.15, but you have the ROE penalty, maybe some potential higher financing costs. Your sales commentary seems pretty strong, and you also have new rates at Georgia Power. So just any other considerations to be thinking of? Tom Fanning : Yes. And not to pick at your question, but all we've ever said about 2024 is $4 to $4.30. I think you were just picking the midpoint. Our range has always been $4 to $4. 30. We put that in place some years ago. Dan? Dan Tucker : Yes. And Nick, we're not going to change course here. We always provide our annual guidance on our fourth quarter call. So we'll do that again here in February and put our 2023 number out there for the first time. And what we are also likely to do in February is we will narrow that $4 to $4.30 based on what we see at the time. One of the important factors and uncertainties that existed three years ago when we put that in place, was knowing we'd have another Georgia Power rate case, and then, of course, everything else that has transpired in those three years. So once we get past that, we'll be positioned to narrow that down. Nick Campanella : That's helpful. And yes, I was just picking the midpoint, but understood for the $4.30. I guess just on the sales growth, your kind of commentary on the economy and your current footprint was notable and just we've seen some of your peers starting to revise longer-term sales load higher. Just how are you kind of thinking about that as we prepare for more of a longer-term update in the fourth quarter call? Tom Fanning : Yes. I don't know whether you saw my saying on CNBC this morning on Squad Box. But it is a consistent refrain, and we're actually surprised that a we bit. Our growth so far has been much higher than what we thought. And it's pretty comprehensive. A summary, though, is kind of notable. I was looking through all of our material, we are essentially back to pre-COVID levels on commercial and industrial sales. Our residential sales number is a little over 5% improved. I think that's probably a reflection of a number of things, but including kind of workforce America's reaction to this new hybrid work environment we're finding. The other thing Dan mentioned is the economic development data, which continues to be strong. We don't see much of a reduction a slowing in those numbers. I have a background with the Fed. And so I always get into the nerdy economic details. But one of the things that our head economist here, kind of Shiver does is look at particular industrial segment. So we take our top 10 industrial segments, which represent, I think, about 80% of our sales for the industrial segment. And we do look at not only kind of period-over-period results, which still show really positive growth, everything looking pretty good. We go to the trouble of going to the first derivative, and I would call that a momentum statistic. That would show that even though we still show really good growth, that the amount of growth is moderating. And we just need to kind of think about that as we look going forward. I know a lot of my peers around the country and the economists and the Fed and all the pundits are talking about potentially a mild recession sometime first, second, third quarters of 2023. We see no data for the Southeast that indicates that would be here. So when you hear recession data, just know that, generally speaking, it is national broad brush kind of statistic. The Southeast region is \u2013 appears to be, by the data we have, much more resilient and much less prone to such a downturn. Nick Campanella : Helpful commentary, really appreciate it. We will see you soon. Tom Fanning : You bet. Operator : We have a question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Fanning : Julien, great to\u2026. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, thanks for taking the time. I appreciate it. Good to see you off late Buzzer chat [ph]. Hey, listen, Tom, I wanted to ask you a question specifically. I mean, we saw some headlines in the quarter here about perhaps your eventual retirement here. Can you talk a little bit about succession planning? And just where we stand in that process? And Tom, specifically, how long are you thinking about staying vis-\u00e0-vis the in-service of the units here, just to prep the street around your thought process? Tom Fanning : Yeah. There's been a lot of written about that. I'm feeling like for mathusalem for heaven's sakes. Look, I am 65.5. So that's a fact. Somebody saw it fit to read an article about that. The fact is Southern Company's Board has made no assessment of that one way or the other. There is no timetable for me leaving. I certainly have an interest in progressing the Vogtle units. That's for sure. You should know also one of my comments to that reporter, I think, got misconstrued or I don't know. He asked me, are you looking for a successor. And I said, look, it's every CEO's job, first day they get there to have a succession plan in place. That got turned into, I'm actively looking for a successor. Here's the truth of it. And you all know this, I think, when you look at our brothers and sisters around the United States, Southern Company has been a terrific place to grow talent. We have several subsidiaries where we can give people experiential opportunities beyond just growing within a silo of functions within their experience at the company. And it is our intention to do that. Somebody is successful in a certain area, we put them into a place where maybe they don't know as much, maybe they're not as comfortable and they've got to build new constituents in order to succeed.  We have a very rigorous process. We have had a rigorous process for 20, 25 years of growing talent and moving them around. The latest example, Robin Boren, who has been Treasurer at Southern Company is now, I guess, effective November 1, going to become CEO of Southern Power. This is just another example of how we move people around that show us that they have the capability to grow into senior, senior positions inside the company. So we'll continue with that. The great news is that there's good talent all over this industry. There's exceptional talent inside Southern. And I'm very, very happy with the bench, the Southern Company management council and beyond. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you for providing that -- clearing the air as you say, on some of the articles out there. If I can just follow up on Nick's last question a little bit. You all have a track record, especially through COVID of finding offsets and reductions and just dealing with difficult context. To the extent in which that we're dealing with inflation today, whether that manifests itself in the form of liability management and interest expense or just generally elevated labor costs at Vogtle and elsewhere, how are you thinking about providing a comprehensive update on that front as well? I know that you talked about narrowing 2024 here. But can you talk a little bit more specifically about your efforts to manage inflation and offsets on that front as well? Dan Tucker : As with just about anything, Julien, it's all of the above approach, right? So -- and it always has been for us. So we have managed both in the short term and more importantly, in the long term, around all of these kind of issues, and we'll continue to do that. So to a degree that will be changing the way we operate, becoming more efficient. It will be looking for ways to deploy capital that thus reduces O&M. It will be looking for ways to grow the business more to help offset what might otherwise be headwinds elsewhere. And then importantly, along the way, while we're focused on all of that, we'll also, as we always are, be focused on clean, safe, reliable and importantly, affordable energy as we navigate this with our regulators and strike the right balance there. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Fair enough. It will be embedded in whatever you guys update on 2024 at the end of the day, I take it. Dan Tucker : Yes, sir. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Good luck and I will speak to you then. Tom Fanning : Thank you my friend. Operator : We have a question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hi. Thank you, guys. Hi, Tom, thank you and Dan for taking my questions. First one, a number of your peers have built up pretty sizable deferred fuel balances that may take a couple of years to recover, just given the spike in power and gas prices. Just curious whether you're seeing the same thing across your larger subsidiaries. And in your conversations with stakeholders, how you're thinking about the time line to recover those different fuel balances? Dan Tucker : Yeah, Michael, this is Dan. So we are certainly having discussions with our regulators. We've been very transparent and proactive about making sure that they understand and appreciate this macro dynamic that has occurred, particularly with natural gas costs and to an extent, coal prices as well. And so yeah, we, like you mentioned, Michael, like many peers, have accumulated a pretty sizable under recovered balance as of the end of the third quarter in total, it's about $2.2 billion. The vast majority of that is at Georgia Power, which is about $1.7 billion. So with each of our jurisdictions, the process is a little different. Some are a little more regular in their cadence. Some are a little more discretionary. I think the plan for that largest balance in Georgia will be addressed that early next year. And again, we'll work very closely with the regulators to make sure that's done in a way that is the least impactful for customers as possible. Tom Fanning : And Michael, I could just add as a comment on dogma. As apart from the so-called organized markets, the integrated regulated markets provide us a mechanism to pass-through fuel costs. So there is no profit incentive for us. In other words, it's always incentive for us to keep prices as low as possible. And so we have done that. We've had programs in place that have helped us keep those costs low. This year, we've hedged 34% of our fuel prices, gas prices at about $3 and 22%, next year, 32% at $4.73. Certainly, those are below the spot prices for natural gas right now. Nobody can predict the future. But certainly, those programs, which have been put in place with the conjunction of the public service commissions have been awfully helpful to reduce the pressure on that issue. Dan Tucker : And one last thing. So just in addition to that continuous proactive dialogue with regulators, we've been having similar conversations with the rating agencies, making sure that they're keenly aware of us likely having to carry a little incremental debt to see this through. But all of our subsidiaries, George Power, in particular, Alabama Power, Mississippi Power, have the financial strength to be able to weather that. Tom Fanning : One last comment I just wanted to do it. But on a going-forward basis, once Vogtle 3 and 4 go in service, the equivalent energy price coming out of that plant is going to be effectively about $1 per million BTU. It's going to be an awfully attractive asset that will run 24/7, 365. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then a follow-up question, a little bit unrelated. I mean, Vogele CapEx should step down materially next year, and then done in 2024, except for maintenance. And there's -- Dan, you made the comment of if there's new generation additions coming in the capital plan, it's in the back end of the plan. How are you thinking about the potential for incremental capital allocation, not necessarily in 2023, because you're still spending on Vogtle, but in 2024, 2025 timeframe? Dan Tucker : Yeah. Look, it's not unchanged from where we were early this year. I mean, our capital plan is designed to support our growth rate of 5% to 7%. I think we highlighted in the fourth quarter call the history of our planning process and how opportunities emerge further out in the forecast you get as we roll the forecast forward. The numbers continue to increase as we get clarity on things, as we bet things with regulators, as new regulations emerge, as new technologies emerge. And I think that will continue to happen. And then, we've got an allocation that we set aside for Southern Power, that's been a little quiet here in recent days, because of the uncertainty that existed before IRA passed, I think you'll see that continue to ramp up. We've got a plan today, Michael, that doesn't require us to issue any equity to finance it. And to the extent we find more opportunities that are able to earn either our regulated returns, or the returns that we require out of the projects in Southern Power, we'll adjust our financing plan, but I'm happy to turn our equity plans on to finance more regulated growth. Michael Lapides : Yeah. And Dan, please correct me, if I misstate this. But I think you guys have done, you and your team, have done a great job illustrating to the investment community how we develop a CapEx estimate. And I'm being more direct than you were. The outer years are always underestimated. When you go through time, we end up spending more money than we estimate in the outer years. And if I had to estimate that in the current five-year plan, aren't we estimating something like $41 billion over five years. And if we kind of adjust it for what may happen, a more reasonable number maybe as much as $45 billion. Dan Tucker : Yeah, I don't think that's unfair. And importantly, the $41 billion, the starting point is what supports our 5% to 7% growth rate. And so as more opportunities to invest are identified, it simply increases the durability of that growth rate either in the short term or over the long-term. Tom Fanning : And you should know, all of you on the phone should know that some companies put a bunch of plug estimates in there. We don't. We do sensitivities to indicate what may happen with higher CapEx, assuming we get appropriate recovery, which we think we would, but that's the way we are. We have a conservative plan. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Operator : We have a question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Fanning : Hey Durgesh. Great to have you with us. Durgesh Chopra : Hey Tom. Thanks for giving me the time. Just one -- I have one housekeeping question and then just a follow-up. In terms of the -- and forgive me if I missed this, and I think you discussed this as part of the last Q&A, but the 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth target, is that -- is that still sort of where you are projecting long-term earnings growth? Tom Fanning : Yeah, we establish that once a year. And we'll come back to you with a new five-year plan. I guess it's in February, but yeah, that's us. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just can you comment on -- there was some discussion of it, just bill increases, what should we expect here in the near-term, excuse me, given the fuel price increases, what are what are we looking at over the next few months in terms of customer bill increases? And how could you potentially offset some of that? Tom Fanning : Yeah. Hey Durgesh, we have a policy. You followed us for some time never front-running a regulatory process. We're not going to start now. So that's going to be a question, I let alone for now. When we see results, then we'll be able to speak to this specifically. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thank you, again. Tom Fanning : You bet. Thank you. Operator : We have a question from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Fanning : Angie, how are you? Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. So just a couple of questions about the Vogtle 4. So is there an agreement between the co-owners as to the in-service date and how the companies are showing it, I almost feel like -- I think I'm referring here to Oglethorpe. It seems like they're showing first quarter 24 as a COD for Vogtle 4 and I'm just wondering if this is basically what the whisper date is or is that it's up to them to actually make a call on the start of commercial operations? Tom Fanning : Angie, it's a wonderful question. Look, our performance to date indicates that we are in the reasonable expectation of achieving a year-end '23 in-service date. You'll have to ask Ogtlethorpe why they may depart from that. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then secondly, just tracking the ITAAC for that unit. And I remember that they were very lumpy with Unit 3. So it's again, I mean, it seems like you need very many of them to start fuel load. So again, is there any pattern in those ITAAC that we should be worried about, or again, they're just as lumpy as they were with Unit 3? Dan Tucker : Yes, there's about 240 or a little above that remaining on Unit 4, Angie. And yes, there's not a normal cadence, if you will and there's also a lot of things that are tied to particular milestone tests. So hot functional testing as an example. There will be a lot that either come as a result of that or after that and that's where we really started focusing on them for Unit 3 and kind of laying out the remaining schedule. But I would not expect any sort of linear progression there, it will be lumpy. Tom Fanning : Well, in fact, your memory is absolutely spot on. It is lumpy and the reason it's lumpy is when we finish systems, then we are able to submit the ITAAC. And recall a problem we had, I guess it was earlier this year, right around the end of the year into January, finishing up all of the paper. We think we put in place controls, processes, which will speak to that. We should not repeat that problem. So as we finish system completions associated with the big milestone, so ultimately, hot functional test you'll see a big ramp up, a lumpy look in ramp-up of submittal of ITAAC. Angie Storozynski : Great. And just one follow-up, and I appreciate that you have limited visibility as to the way the elections are going to be run for the GRC \u2013 for the commission. Now when I think about the prudence review and the elections that may happen between now and then, how many of the commissioners will have been replaced? Again, I know that it depends when the elections actually happen, but just theoretically? Tom Fanning : I couldn't even hazard a guess at that. It really depends on when they come up -- when the legislature comes up with this new process. I have no idea when that will be or what the outcome will be and therefore, it's hard to answer your question. I'm sorry. Dan Tucker : But based on the current terms, Angie, there were only 2 appropriations this year, and there were none scheduled for next year. And so just Again, if this gets resolved quickly, it will be the election, there's another commissioner of reelection in 2024. Angie Storozynski : Very good. Okay. That\u2019s all I need. Thank you. Tom Fanning : Election, yeah. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Fanning : Hello, Paul. Paul Fremont : Hey. How is it going? Congratulations on good quarter. Tom Fanning : Thank you. Appreciate it. Paul Fremont : Can you update us on the construction work that's left on Unit 3? I think you had indicated that you were doing construction after you got the 103G letter up until fuel load. Is all of that construction completed or how many hours of construction are remaining there? Tom Fanning : Tiny amount. And I wouldn't almost refer to it as construction at this point. It's really finishing the finest tuning, if you can imagine, in order to go critical. For example, we've loaded the fuel. We have to put the top on the reactor vessel and ratchet down the enormous bolt structures that will tighten that top down. We have to finish what they call coating. So this would be areas like walls that just need to be painted, that weren't required on a safety-related basis. It is finally -- so in the reactor vessel in order for us to load fuel, it had to be pristine, cleanliness and actually putting the top on the reactor vessel preserves that condition. We want to finish all of the minute cleaning procedures that will be necessary for us to run that plant. It's stuff like that. Paul Fremont : And is this -- I mean, is it days, weeks, months? Tom Fanning : Well, what I would say, Paul is the next milestone we're guiding you to is, Paul Fremont : Criticality? Tom Fanning : It's criticality and that's January. Paul Fremont : So you would finish then the construction between now and then or whatever additional work there is between now and January? Tom Fanning : Yes, right. I'm not sure, I would call that construction, but yes. That's right. Paul Fremont : And then, can you discuss the secondary steam systems in the plant? Do we need to wait until after criticality when you go through that testing phase to make sure that, that system is working the way that you wanted to work or can you address that earlier? Tom Fanning : So here's the thing. There is a prescribed process and it's a great graph, but nobody let me put it out there. But it's a really interesting looking graph that shows a prescribed process of taking the plant up in power and then taking it down. For example, within, I think, the first week or so, 10 days, we'll get to 25% power, then they take it down. And then we'll go to 50% and take it down. Then we'll go to 75% and take it down, then 90% and then 100%. They do all sorts of trips and bells and whistles along the way. And what they're trying to do is what may be a condition that could exist once the plant goes in service, to make sure that everything works as it is supposed to. If you want more details on that, we filed the VCM here recently. And there's a good bit of background in that VCM report that we filed that can give you more here if you want to see it. Paul Fremont : Great. And then, last question for me. I'll take a shot at what somebody asked is an earlier question, but do you -- would you expect to settle the general rate case, or do you think the parties are too far apart? Tom Fanning : No, it's not -- whether we settle or not has no bearing on too far apart or, at least, hasn't in the years past. Paul, I mean, you've followed us forever, it seems like. And we have had this process in place since 1995. And every three years, we go through this. And typically, we reach an agreement just before the holidays. I would expect that to occur again. There's a lot of value. It's almost therapeutic, if you will, to let everybody's views come out in the open and have a good fair debate. We've been treated fairly every other time, my sense is, we'll be treated fairly again. Paul Fremont : Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Tom Fanning : Always appreciate you joining us. Operator : And we have a question from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. Travis Miller : Hello. Thanks for taking my question. The customer growth, to the extent that, that continues above the forecast, what does that mean for mix of CapEx spending in terms of distribution versus potentially even transmission, but certainly, distribution versus generation, where does that stand? Tom Fanning : If I remember correctly, Dan, again, correct me if I'm wrong. In the old days, we spent about $1 billion a year on T&D kind of every year. I would argue that maybe amped up a little in recent years, because of, what I would call, hardening or resilience expenditures. You remember Hurricane Yuri. Hurricane, gee, it was Winter Storm Uri that went through Texas. One of the things we did in a proactive way was to look at our kind of planning margin system average temperature, and we reduced that temperature to give us more margin on extreme weather. Those are the kinds of things that we are spending more money on T&D for, I would argue. As well, there is some T&D expenditures that will be intertwined with ultimately our generation location decisions. And I think we've been over this a lot with you guys, but if you look at North Georgia, what's the final disposition and when at plant Bowen. Whether we locate more generation in the north, or let more generation be located in the South and add the transmission necessary to get that generation to the load center. Those are the kind of decisions that we'll cover in the next, I don't know, three to five years. Travis Miller : Okay. That's helpful. And then, real quick back on the capital allocation, I know you can't talk about what the Board is going to do, but what are general thoughts on the dividend to the extent that you get to that post Vogtle $4 to $4.30. Obviously, that suggests a significant jump. What are your thoughts on that side? Dan Tucker : Yes, Travis, this is Dan. So we've talked about this in an earlier call. There is -- if you look in our slide deck, slide 21 kind of represents the uplift from the completion of Vogtle from a cash flow perspective. We're really thinking about that uplift supporting three things. One is an improvement in our overall financial profile, in particular, our credit profile. Then two is, it continues to fund our growth. And then thing three is the dividend. We have increased the dividend every year for over two decades now, going back 75 years. We've never cut the dividend. It's an incredibly important part of our overall value proposition. As we get to 2024, given the improvement in our profile and given a durable growth rate, we think the Board will certainly have the opportunity to reevaluate the pace of growth and perhaps better align the growth in the dividend with growth in earnings. Travis Miller : Okay. That\u2019s great. I understand. Thanks so much. Scott Gammill : Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any other closing remarks? End of Q&A: Tom Fanning : No, I'm just reminded, maybe age is getting to me, but I can remember one time, I don't know, five, six years ago, where somebody was pleading with me to have a boring earnings call. The old mantra of regular, predictable, sustainable starts to reenter our dialogue now, as we finish these major milestones on Vogtle and we look towards the future. I wouldn't say this was a boring call at all, but it certainly has less volatility in it, given the performance that this company has been able to achieve. Here's hoping for the future. We feel confident, and we look forward to finishing the year strong and looking forward to a new year next year. Thank you all for joining us, and we appreciate it. See you soon. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Southern Company had another exceptional year in 2022. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share consistent with the very top of our guidance range. These results were due in no small part to the culmination of the hard work of thousands of people throughout our company to put in day in and day out to provide customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy. Our operations team, generation fleet and power delivery system worked exceedingly well in 2022 which included meeting an all-time peak load of over 41,000 megawatts in June and navigating well in extreme winter cold event over the Christmas weekend that pushed electric demand to a system peak load of nearly 38,000 megawatts, a December record. Our success with these events is a testament to the value of our vertically integrated state regulated business model delivers to our customers and the communities we are privileged to serve. A great example of the benefits which come from our state's long-term integrated planning processes is the 26% winter reserve margin factored into the capacity planning process. This winter reserve margin, which is significantly higher than typical summer reserve margin inherently recognizes that peak demand in the winter occurs during the dark early morning hours when solar resources are diminished and cold temperatures can have unintended adverse effects on generation and fuel supply equipment. Such thoughtful planning assumptions, along with robust winterization programs and a continuous focus on resilience investments are top of mind across all of our state-regulated utilities. Let's turn now to an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Since our last call, the site team at Unit 3 has turned to testing and start-up process in support of the unit's next major milestone, initial criticality. During this process, as disclosed in January, we identified vibrations associated with certain piping within the passive cooling system, which required additional time to remediate. The site team cooled down the unit and successfully remediated the vibrations, allowing them to resume the testing, which precedes initial criticality. During this work, we identified a few additional issues to address, consistent with our focus on optimal long-term performance and getting it right. We've added some additional time to the Unit 3 schedule to address these items and to reduce the risks associated with other potential issues emerging. We now project placing Unit 3 in service in May or June of 2023. Turning now to Unit 4. Substantial progress continued throughout the last quarter. We successfully completed cold hydro testing in early December. Electrical production and terminations through year-end were sustained at levels supportive of our year-end 2023 in-service objective. All required systems necessary to start hot functional testing on Unit 4 have been completed and turned over to the initial test program. Component and system testing activities are steadily increasing and are now critical path in support of the next major milestones for Unit 4, hot functional testing and fuel load. We have seen a marked improvement in testing results for Unit 4 compared to the Unit 3 process, which reflects the increased focus on first-time construction quality and timely documentation. Even with the improved results, somewhat slower than planned testing productivity has consumed margin in our schedule. The sites working Vogtle continues to reflect a couple of months of remaining margin for a 2023 in-service date. After careful consideration and given our experience on Unit 3 and the degree of critical work ahead of us, we are further risk adjusting our Unit 4 schedule to reflect a range of the projected in-service date between late 4th quarter of 2023 and the end of the first quarter of 2024. Turning now to cost. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast reflects a projected increase of $201 million to fund the extension of Unit 3 and Unit 4 projected in-service dates to the end of the second quarter 2023 and to the end of the first quarter 2024, respectively, plus modest increases in the projected cost of resources to complete the remaining work and testing on Unit 4. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $150 million during the quarter. We've included project schedules for the next major milestones for each unit, including initial criticality for Unit 3 and and the start of hot functional testing for Unit 4 in the materials provided for this call. Our priority remains bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We will continue to take the time needed to get it right and will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet schedule. Dan, I'll turn the call over to you. Dan Tucker : Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had strong financial results for the year with adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, $0.19 higher than 2021. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher revenues associated with retail pricing, warmer weather, primarily in the second quarter of 2022, customer growth, increased usage and investment on our regulated utilities. These revenue effects were partially offset by higher non-fuel O&M expenses and higher interest expenses. The increase in non-fuel O&M reflects long-term commitments to our regulated utilities to reliability and resiliency, along with efforts to advance maintenance activities in light of emerging cost pressures. Additional shares from the mandatory conversion of our equity units in August '22 are also reflected in 2022 EPS results. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and 2022 and back above pre-pandemic levels, we continue to see robust residential growth with the addition of nearly 50,000 residential electric customers and over 30,000 residential gas customers throughout the year. Residential customer usage also continued to outpace our expectations, reflecting sustained hybrid work practices across our service territories. Additionally, commercial sales for 2022 beat our forecast by nearly 2%, reflecting a reversion to pre-pandemic trends as the economy shifts from consuming goods to services. Industrial sales for 2022 were lower than forecast by 1.5%, driven by a chemical facility closure and weakening industrial sales momentum during the second half of the year. With interest rates rising, we have seen slowing in construction and housing-related sectors, such as lumber, stone, clay and glass and textiles. In the fourth quarter of 2022, eight of our top 10 industrial segments experienced slower sales growth as compared to the prior quarter. Included in our 2023 guidance is an assumption of retail electric sales growth of 0% to 1%. And as in prior quarters, we continue to monitor the potential implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflationary pressures on our outlook. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. 2022 economic development announcements in our Southeast service territories saw an increase in expected job creation and capital investment of 135% and 257%, respectively, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The pipeline of potential projects grew significantly compared to recent years with new corporate announcements and expansions representing a broad cross-section of industries, including automotive, technology, e-fulfillment and distribution, health care and bioscience. In addition to the traditional factors that have historically drawn businesses to our service territory like transportation networks, lower cost of living and business-friendly state and local policies. Another emerging trend that continues to drive momentum in both economic development wins and the size of the potential pipeline is the diversified workforce, especially technology workers and the diverse university systems in our territories, which prominently feature several HBCUs. We're proud to have been on the forefront of helping develop this workforce through our significant investment along with Apple in the Propel Center in Atlanta. More and more, as other companies strive to have their workforce reflect the diverse global customers they serve, our Southeast service territories have become a top choice for relocation or expansion. We are proud of the significant role that our subsidiaries play in attracting new businesses to our service territories. And in 2022, Site Selection Magazine named Alabama Power and Georgia Power, Top U.S. utilities for economic development for the fourth consecutive year and recognize the state of Georgia as the second best business climate in the country. Strong economic development activity continues to differentiate our Southeast service territories from other areas of the country. Turning now to our expectations for 2023. Our adjusted earnings guidance range for the year is $3.55 to $3.65 per share. Expected drivers for 2023 versus 2022, our continued growth in our state-regulated subsidiaries, including the contribution related to Vogtle Unit 3 going into service, offset by higher parent company interest expense including financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with costs in excess of $7.3 billion seemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC and share dilution, reflecting the full year impact of the mandatory conversion of our equity units in August 2022. We estimate adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share for the first quarter. Additionally, we are narrowing our 2024 adjusted guidance range of $4 to $4.30 which was established in early 2021. In order to acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in providing guidance three years in advance, the original 2024 range was wider than our typical annual EPS guidance ranges. Since this range was introduced in February 2021, our state-regulated outcomes have been largely consistent with our assumptions. Several upside opportunities inherent in the top end of our original range, like renewable and storage investment opportunities at both our state-regulated electric companies and Southern Power have been deferred to later years largely due to adverse market conditions, including more challenging, contracting requirements and global supply chain constraints. Financing costs, particularly parent company interest rates are a significant headwind relative to our forecast in early 2021. Rates on variable and short-term debt are significantly higher than expected, and as securities in our low-cost debt portfolio mature, new issuances, no matter the tenor, are significantly more expensive. Compounding these negative parent company interest rate effects are the growth in our state-regulated capital plans relative to early 2021 and the increased cost for Georgia Power share of Vogtle 3 and 4 which has grown by nearly $1.9 billion since early 2021. Collectively, these factors would narrow our $4 to $4.30 range, adjusted for 2024 to $4.10. Adding the potential for Vogtle 4 to be completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 which would have a negative $0.05 per share impact solely in 2024, we are providing an adjusted 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share. We plan to further narrow this range during our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call early next year. We continue to see our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with our updated 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range. This projected growth is supported by a $43 billion capital plan with 97% of total projected capital deployment over the next five years at our state-regulated utilities. Additionally, our history of constructive regulation, strong credit ratings and disciplined O&M spending served to strengthen our outlook. Our robust capital investment program continues to be driven by significant investment in our state-regulated utility businesses, our total base capital investment plan of approximately $43 billion which excludes the capital required to complete Vogtle Units 3 and 4 reflects a $2 billion increase in state-regulated utility investments relative to our previous five-year forecast. These increases in our forecast are the result of greater visibility into infrastructure required to serve major customer additions and expansions, further improve our grid and protect our technology infrastructure, as well as investments related to the transformation of our generation fleet. We have continued to maintain our disciplined approach to capital forecasting within our state regulated utility businesses. Consistent with past practice, we don't include placeholders, and we don't include capital that isn't expected to earn or allowed regulated returns. The result of this approach is that our capital expenditure forecasts tend to grow especially in the later years as our visibility into customer growth increases as regulatory processes unfold as compliance obligations evolved and as our long-term system planning is refined. We fully expect this trend to continue. Additionally, we continue to believe Southern Power has a significant opportunity to continue growing through investments that facilitate fleet transitions and the growth of clean energy infrastructure across the United States. Southern Power's business model has been distinctive since its beginnings in the early 2000s, focusing on long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties and a risk-adjusted return profile that aligns well with our overall value proposition. We've allocated up to $3.5 billion over the five-year plan with approximately $500 million in 2023 and $750 million annually for the remainder of the forecast period. These allocations of capital are not included in our base capital forecast. Our financial plan is anchored to our base capital forecast of $43 billion. As I have already suggested, we believe upside potential exists in our state-regulated subsidiary forecast and our Southern Power allocation, which, if realized, would result in total spend of over $46 billion. We also continue to believe many of the same drivers for additional potential investment over the next five years could translate to investment opportunities beyond 2027, as we continue our journey to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions. We've included a three year financing plan in the appendix to today's slide deck. This plan, which is consistent with our updated capital investment plan and the potential capital investment opportunities that we have highlighted continues to assume no equity need over our five-year planning horizon. As always, we will maintain our discipline and the flexibility to use all the financing tools at our disposal to drive value for shareholders. Credit quality and strong investment-grade credit ratings remain a top priority and we continue to believe that to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must maintain a strong credit profile. As we complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, we believe the expected reduction in construction risk and the projected improvement in FFO to debt metrics further position us to support our credit quality objectives. Tom, I will now turn the call back over to you. Tom Fanning : Thank you, Dan. Southern Company strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder returns, and I believe the plan we've laid out will support that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, our growing investment in our state-regulated utility franchises, the priority we place on credit quality and our action towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions all contribute to making Southern Company a premier sustainable investment. Our remarkable dividend track record remains a vital component to our value proposition. For three quarters of a century, we have paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter, including sustained dividend increases for more than 20 years. In closing, I'm sure that most of you are well aware of the recent announcement of Chris Womack to succeed me as President and Chief Executive Officer in the coming months. I will remain as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. In conjunction with this announcement, where a number of other senior leadership changes, which highlighted the depth of talent we've worked hard to develop at Southern Company. I expect each of these leaders will flourish in their new roles, further strengthen the Company's deep bench and bring a fresh perspective to each of our businesses. With Chris Womack and his team leading us, the future of Southern Company is in great hands as we continue to strive to make the communities that we have the privilege to serve better off because we're there. And as we continue our relentless pursuit to provide customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack for a few brief remarks before we get to Q&A. Chris Womack : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I cannot be more excited to have the privilege to lead Southern Company in the months and years ahead. It is an important time in our industry as the energy landscape continues to evolve and customers' needs continue to change. Southern Company is at the forefront of that evolution, and we are building the future of energy. It is an honor to lead teams that are dedicated to innovating and delivering world-class customer service and reliability to customers while also moving boldly forward in our journey to continuously represent our values and improve the communities we serve. Tom and his predecessors along with the thousands of team members across the enterprise Tom mentioned earlier have built a solid foundation for Southern Company. And we've got a lot of important work ahead of us to continue to build upon their legacy. Thank you all again for joining us this afternoon. I look forward to getting the opportunity to get out and interact more closely with each of you in the investment community during the weeks and months ahead. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Tom Fanning : Shar, how are you? James Ward : Tom, Shar is actually on the road traveling at West. It's James Ward here on for him. Thank you. Very much appreciated. Glad to be here. I just wanted to first congratulate Chris, on your new role and Tom, on your planned transition and the evolution of your role in the Company. So congrats to you both. So I have a few questions here. Quick one off the bat. I just had a few inbound questions from people. To clarify, the 5 to 7 base remains the 2024 midpoint, but now it's the midpoint of $3.95 to $4.10, is that correct? Or is there another way to think about the base for that 5 to 7 going forward post-Vogtle? Dan Tucker : Yes. James, this is Dan. So look, we were very intentional in choosing the words consistent with our adjusted guidance range. Those words were really acknowledging of two things. Thing one is just like we did with the $4 to $4.30, will further narrow this range as we get line of sight on Unit 4 and have our fourth quarter earnings call next year. Thing two, that it acknowledges is that the $0.05 impact for Vogtle 4 potentially going into the first quarter of 2024 is a one-year effect and so the growth rate will be off of that narrowed range when we get to 2024. Tom Fanning : The other thing is the $0.05 reflects a full charge, assuming you go in at the end of the quarter. I'm really I would be a little disappointed if that's where we end up. Right now, as we stand, adding that extra quarter, we got five months of margin on Unit 4. Hopefully, we can do better than that. James Ward : That's very clear and that's great. Okay. So it'd be a higher base than what some people might have been reading it out. That's good to hear. Looking at your new capital plan and then assuming that some or all of the CapEx beyond the base plans are able to be added. Could you give us a bit more color on how much of that $3 billion could potentially end up at the regulated utilities versus Southern Power? And then as a follow-up, in the slides, you show the 11 different categories there, the examples of where that incremental investment could be renewables, transmission, et cetera. In your view, which of these categories are most likely to end up in the plan? What's kind of low-hanging fruit, if there is such a thing or just what is most probable and in sort of what years if we were to be building kind of an upside scenario versus a base scenario that we're trying to look at what would make the most sense to kind of prioritize there? Tom Fanning : Yes. If it was me, do you include the graphs you've done in the past about how the CapEx shows? We have yes, there you go. Was that Page 21 is what I'm looking at. I do know what you guys see. We have a history of always undershooting, especially our outward year forecast. And on the average, I would say that taken over the five years, we undershoot another $3 billion, just round numbers. So if you look over the entire five-year period and an upside case, may include $3 billion of additional franchise related rate base looking CapEx investments. Whether Southern Power hits its $3 billion or not, remains to be seen about market conditions, supply chain constraints and a variety of other things. We've been very clear in past calls to call out what I think have been challenging market conditions. Shorter terms, we like bilateral contracts, no fuel risk, creditworthy counterparties, et cetera. The contract conditions have gotten tougher. And we're very disciplined. We generally expect about 150 basis points premium for us to go down the bilateral contract out via Southern Power as compared to our franchise utilities. Now whether we're able to duplicate that or not, we'll see. If they don't show up, we won't invest. If you want to include more upside, I would include some portion of that $3-plus billion for Southern Power over the five-year period. I would also kind of tilt those investments towards the back end. One last comment I will make, we said it in the script, but I think it's important. When you look at additional CapEx available outside the five-year period, I think you really do start picking up some of the generation transition kind of capital that may be available. Recall, we will have a high bias towards more gas, more renewables, particularly solar in our region. Dan, do you want to add to that? Dan Tucker : Look, I think you covered it really well. The other thing I'd just reinforce, James, is that the 5% to 7% growth rate is based on our $43 billion capital plan opportunity to deploy more than that simply strengthens our position in that regard or potentially lengthens our position in that regard. And just going back to what Tom said about the longer term. Just recall, a lot of our coal retirement plans happen at the very end or the year after our five-year plan, and that really is where a lot of incremental opportunities also get unlocked. Tom Fanning : I mean, for example, a big slug of retirements are in '29. So as Dan said, that's outside the fact. James Ward : Got you. That's extremely helpful and especially the color on upside there. Very much appreciated. Yes, that helps a lot. The final question for us is in the slides, you mentioned that you expect robust customer growth across your service territories will then also, of course, only expecting flat to slightly increasing retail electric sales, building on the details that you shared in the prepared remarks. Could you give us just a bit more granularity given that these are broad rather than just regionally focused on one particular area? On these broad trends, what's driving the divergence there? Or are you just taking a more conservative approach going forward to help us understand a bit more how to look at it? Tom Fanning : Yes. It is kind of a conservative approach. But here's the thing. We have in front of us kind of data that supports a couple of different scenarios. On CNBC this morning, I talked about the potential for a soft or no landing. In other words, when you look at growth year-over-year, we have kind of a negative mixed bag of things going on in industrial. They're not all negative. There are some positives. But when you look at the momentum statistics, that is the first derivative of growth, they're all negative. In other words, even if you grew year-over-year, the growth rate was smaller. So that would seem to indicate that at least within the industrial sector, that things are slowing a bit. Now they have been way better than what they thought we would be, but still slowing, okay? On the other hand, what we're seeing out of our economic development statistics, increase in job announcements of 130% increase in capital investment a little over 250%. That says that economic development projects generally show up in the two to three to perhaps more time frame. So what it says is we may see a wee bit of a downturn of slowing in the economy in -- in 2023, but we don't see this thing dipping into recession levels, and we see recovery. Certainly, I think the Southeast is demonstrated that capability in the past. A couple more economic data that's important. We tend to grow about 1% a year projected for the next, I don't know, five years. Everybody is able to get jobs for the most part right now. We have historically low unemployment levels. So you add the kind of steady drumbeat of population growth to the Southeast as Dan said before, a business-friendly climate. I think we can see maybe some slowing in '23, but recovering in '24. Dan Tucker : And then James, just connect that back to your previous question. Look, this growth is certainly exceeding our expectations in terms of the economic development activity, and that could very well translate to the need to invest more to serve that load that was not anticipated. So we think over the next three to five years, that will all begin to be very transparent to the market. Tom Fanning : One last point. The -- it looks like the work environment on employees, we call it hybrid now, but it looks like it's settling down. So we're seeing residential higher than what we thought commercial is certainly higher than what we thought. We'll see how that works out in the future. There's probably still some variance there. James Ward : Very helpful all around, especially in framing potential upside scenarios there, which it looks like you guys might be very well positioned to head into depending on how the macro environment works out. Either way, looking forward to having Vogtle done this year, as I'm sure you and everyone else are and being able to move on to everything you've just been talking about. So it looks like great things ahead. Thanks again for taking the question. Appreciate it. Operator : We have a question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Fanning : Steve, thanks for joining us. Steven Fleishman : Yes, so just on -- and by the way, congrats to both Tom and Chris and Tim and team. So -- the -- on the Vogtle 3, could you please elaborate on the few additional issues that are comment of reducing risk of other issues? Can we get color on all that? Tom Fanning : Yes, sure. There were kind of three things. There were many other tests in the three things we identified. So -- you should know that we successfully evaluated a lot of things going up to criticality. So the three though that we point to that caused delays, at least the first two on their own weren't big, but they required us as we started to heat the plant up and pressurize it, we saw the vibrations. There was some conversation about whether we should start the critical test and fix it later and we said, no, let's do it right. So we brought the plant down. We inserted a couple of metal plates, to be honest with you. It's to some trucks that connect to the pipe and fix the vibration. I mean it was pretty straightforward, it just took time to heat up, pressurize, take heat down, depressurized. The second thing we saw was a valve that was connected to some pipes that effectively had two DRIPs per minute. We wanted to eliminate all DRIPs. And we identified that there was a repositioning of a flange associated with this valve that we ultimately are -- I think we're just about fixed with it today, but I got a report from Pete Sena, our President of Nuclear. And I think that's done today. That's completed. The last issue is not completed, but it has to do with flow through the reactor coolant pumps. And we're just now making sure that we know what the issue is. It could be a physical issue, it could be a calibration issue. In fact, the flow may be good, but we need to recalibrate the measurements around it. So we're all about kind of looking at that today. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then in terms of the comment about doing these to reduce the risk of other issues, is that -- are you saying there that kind of by doing these things? Do you think the chance of other things coming up at this point is going to be lower or something after you started up or the opposite? Tom Fanning : I would think so. Yes, Steve, I would think so. I mean, that's -- when we go in to fix the vibration on the pipe, we saw this other set we said, yes, let's not push it, let's fix it. All of that takes time. It's just phrase we use, but we really do act on it and get it right. We'd rather have this thing, get into criticality. Once you go nuclear and go critical, things become much tougher. So anything we know about let's deal with it now. And you should know that anything we find now we go over to Unit 4 and check that, for example, and we think the issue on pipe vibrations is spoken for now on Unit 4. We won't see that. So anyway, that really is the answer. We're trying to get as much as we can. Once you get go critical, it's a much more challenging environment than it is before you go critical. Just trying to get everything we can see right now. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And I guess is the fact that you found these things kind of a concern that you're going to find more? Or is it really more the opposite that you found these things, this is just part of a big plant starting up, and hopefully, there's less of a risk from here? Tom Fanning : Yes. But that is why we test, right? I mean you should view the power ascension once you go critical as a series of tests that involve a whole variety of different conditions of the plant, taking it up, bringing it down, throwing emergency stops in there, all kinds of things. The purpose of the initial voyage, if they will, the test voyage is to find problems. And we allow for that within the schedule. And now, in fact, we have more time to allow the schedule calls for, I guess, on the original schedule, something like two months of testing, the prescribed start-up in is two months. And there's roughly a month of slack time to fix things, okay? We now have, I think, another month that we've added into our projection into the second quarter. But for sure, Steve, we'll find some\u2026 Operator : Our next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Arcaro : Extend my congratulations as well. I was just wondering, a follow-up on that question. Is NRC approval? Has that been needed for any of the remediation work on these couple of issues that you found at Unit 3? Tom Fanning : We've been in constant contact with the NRC. And we did have, I think, with connection of the vibration two license amendments, but we got those in a matter of days. This was not a protracted process. And like I say, I think that we continue to work hand in glove with those guys. They were also aware of the valve leak and they're happy, I think, with the process that we're following there. You should understand that the working relationship with all of the external parties, whether it's the NRC or whether it's the state commission or DOE, anybody. We all sit in the same meetings. We all see the same stuff. We have and complete transparency and everything we do on that side. David Arcaro : That makes sense. Understood. And are these issues that at this point now, you could potentially avoid for Unit 4 bring learnings from the start-up process on Unit 3 and potentially make Unit 4 smoother such that it's not a kind of a one-for-one delay here equals a delay later? Tom Fanning : Amen, brother. That's exactly what we're trying to do. And in fact, the process, I think it's been noted by many have shown that Unit 4 is going a lot smoother than Unit 3 just because of learnings of Unit 3. I think the process we went through in Unit 3 at times was somewhat painful, but I think it was certainly instructive. If you may remember, as we started, we went into HFT for Unit 3, we were turning over systems like the day before we went to HFT. For example, all systems necessary to undertake HFT have been completed. The long pole in the 10 on HFT at Unit 4 is our ITP, our integrated test plan. David Arcaro : Yes. Got you. Got you. And then a separate topic, but the decline in natural gas prices is a nice tailwind for customer builds. I was wondering when would customers -- could you just remind us when they might see lower prices flow through into rates? And how does that interact this year with your plans for the deferred fuel collections? Dan Tucker : David, this is Dan. So certainly, lower prices are going to benefit customers. And Georgia Power, in particular, who has the largest unrecovered balance ended the year at about $2.1 billion. They'll file at the end of February for those rates. So I certainly don't want to front-run that process. But if to the extent forecast continue to look the way they do today or further come down, the impact on customer bills will be greatly mitigated. The -- our other electric jurisdictions have already initially addressed the under recovery that was happening. And so these lower prices are simply going to accelerate that recovery. Operator : And we have a question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Tom Fanning : Thanks for joining us. Durgesh Chopra : Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. I think, Dan, this is in your view house. Maybe just -- I apologize if I missed this, but can you give us your sort of your CFO to debt or FFO to debt as of year-end 2022? And where that is tracking versus the -- your targeted credit metrics? And then when in your planning horizon, do you expect to get to your targeted credit metrics? Dan Tucker : Yes, Durgesh, thanks for the question, and happy to share that. And as you know, all the agencies calculate those metrics at a slightly different way. But I think there's certainly a lot of focus on Moody's and S&P. So I'll hit on those, in particular. Moody's, we were about 12% for 2022 and S&P about 15%. And as you'd expect, those were pretty significantly impacted by the under-recovered fuel dynamics, particularly the Moody's metric in the way that they calculate that. A portion of it is the debt and a portion of it for us is also the impact that under recovering that fuel had on our tax appetite and our ability to monetize tax benefits, you combine those factors overall, really about a 400 basis point impact to the Moody's metric in 2022. As we look ahead, and we've talked about this a lot in the past, Vogtle certainly on its own, has a significant impact on improving the overall financial profile of the Company as we begin to recover our investment on that in the future. As we get out to 2024, once it's in service, our metrics are closer to 17%, 18%, which are well above our targets and provide us that kind of buffer against adversity that we prefer to have in our profile. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. That's super helpful then. So just to be clear, like you would be outside of the fuel balance, you would be close to like 16% on Moody's basis as of the end of 2022, if you exclude the fuel balance that's on the balance sheet? Dan Tucker : That's right. And as I give you that 17% to 18% projection in the future, that includes an assumption that we might still have an unrecovered balance that we continue to collect, but that it's certainly been worked down and Vogtle has kind of overlaid that to improve the overall profile. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Got it. And just one hopefully, a quick one. In 2023 EPS guidance range, can you just remind us like what is your assumption for earnings from the Unit 3? Dan Tucker : So, it's about $0.04 or so that it contributes in 2023 relative to 2022. So that's essentially the assumption of a little more than half the year in service and then there's -- that's offset slightly by the fact that there's some of the rate base that won't actually earn its full return until Unit 4 is also in service. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. And congratulations, Chris and Tom, I much appreciate the time today. Operator : Our next question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Fanning : Angie, how are you? Agnie Storozynski : Good, good. But I will star it up a little bit. So can we talk about management succession? So, we're really glad to see the updates and congratulations to you and Chris, but I'm just wondering how the Chris' appointment reconciles with the the age policy that Southern used to have at least? That's one. And then two is, we've had some negative headlines around Alabama Power. There's been a change in CEO. And I'm just basically asking if there's any link in those management changes at that subsidiary and those media headlines? Tom Fanning : Yes, sure. The 65 thing is it's kind of a policy. It's not a rule, I don't guess. The Board and I had lots of discussions about staying on beyond 65. One of my personal interest has been to help see Vogtle through. And I'm still young physically and young at heart, I guess, and when we kind of cross that threshold, we looked at people like, Wow, Mac, who is, I guess, you're what, a year younger than me. And if you've been around Chris at all, you would know that he still acts like a 25-year-old. So it was very easy to see him continue in the role, and he has fire in his belly and he's done a great job wherever he's been most notably at Georgia Power, successfully working with our constituents on the three-year triennial rate case that we do. So it was easy for us to kind of say, look, 65 is just a number, so long as we're able to contribute in a robust way, that's great. And that's how we did that. There really wasn't any connection with Mark Crossley, to be honest with you. He had -- I don't know, I want to go into all that, but he had some issues he wanted to deal with. It was reasonably clear that he wasn't a contender as a successor here, and I think he decided to retire. That was kind of his choice at the end of the day. Agnie Storozynski : Okay. So just one follow-up on Chris. So we should expect that Chris is going to stay in the current spot for the next couple of years, even crosses that 65-year old threshold? Tom Fanning : Yes. I'll go ahead with. Chris was asked directly. He's committed to 70. Agnie Storozynski : Okay. Good for you. Okay. So moving on to Southern Power. So I hear your comments and I see, obviously, the reduction and growth CapEx of that subsidiary. But is it -- I mean, are you trying to conserve in a sense of financing? Is that the constraint? I mean, I obviously hear issues with profitability of additional contract-based renewables and some constraints about equipment availability. But I'm just wondering if the -- if you were just trying to plan your spending for Southern Power within the capital structure that you currently have? Tom Fanning : No, Angie. It has nothing to do with that. It really is two things. So Dan is a conservative soul and he likes to build his plan without considering upside. So as we've done for years, the way before Dan got here, we don't put in place holders. We think about them and think about what effect they could have. Further, we don't add anything from Southern Power. And you should think about contributions from Southern Power as upside to the base case. It really isn't a constraint of capital structure or balance sheet. Operator : We have a question from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nick Campanella : Congrats to all management changes. I guess just hot functional for Unit 4. You have this nice slide here, Slide 8, looks like end of March to, call it, late June on HFT. Just going back to kind of the conservatism comments like where do you kind of see yourself tracking towards now with the system turnovers and the line of sight? Tom Fanning : The site working plan has HFT in March. We know that things can happen between now and then, but that's what it shows. Nick Campanella : Okay. And then can you just update us on the time line for the prudency review just with the latest kind of update to the COD data? Tom Fanning : It's fuel load on Unit 4. Chris, do you want to say anything more? Chris Womack : We're scheduled to end a prudence on fuel load of 4 -- so that's the schedule and that's the path we'll take, and that's the agreement arrangement we have with the Georgia Public Service Commission. Nick Campanella : Okay. So mid-summer here. All right. Thank you so much. Operator : We have a question from [Paul Fremont] with Ladenburg. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Fanning : Hello, Paul, I always glad to have you with us. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. Going back to -- going back to Unit 3. The flow-through on the reactor or cooling comps, is that a valve issue as well? Or is that something else? Tom Fanning : Still kind of running it down. It could be a calibration issue. It could just be the way we measure the flow going through. So we're trying to guess what it is at this point. It is really not practical. They're doing all the work necessary to get to the bottom of that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And the valve issue that you talked about with the DRIP, that's completely resolved? Tom Fanning : Thanks. Yes, I talked to Pete Sena, gosh, 11:30 today and he thought it was taken care of. We'll see. Unidentified Analyst : And then how many ITAAC approvals do you think you need to move forward and actually do hot functional testing? Tom Fanning : Zero. We're good. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, because I thought on Unit 3, there were a certain number of ITAACs that you thought were nuclear-related where you didn't feel comfortable doing the hot functional testing without having those in hand. Tom Fanning : No. I think you're remembering fuel load there, we're in awfully good shape. And if you look at where we are on four as compared to three in relation to HFT, we are light years better. Mean we're ready to go. All we got to do is finish the required tests before we get the heat going and run the plant. That really is the critical path at this point. Unidentified Analyst : And then last question for me. If you were to do the additional CapEx beyond the base, does that also not require equity? Or does equity come with that? Dan Tucker : Based on our current projections, we would still not project any equity. And that's where when I talked about having that cushion in our credit metrics, that plays a big part of that. Operator : And we have a question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Fanning : Anthony, how are you? Anthony Crowdell : Not bad, Tom, how are you doing? Tom Fanning : Fantastic, my friend. Anthony Crowdell : Congrats to all and I just have one quick follow-up from Durgesh's question on the credit side of the world. Just with the units going in service, do you think the credit agencies lower the downgrade threshold because of the, I guess, reduced business risk? Dan Tucker : Yes. Look, Anthony, I never want to speak for the agencies. I would look like us that aren't currently building nuclear units, many of them have lower thresholds. So I think there's certainly a strong argument for that to potentially take place. I won't speak for, but they should. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Tom Fanning : Yes. Really appreciate you guys joining us. It's an exciting year 2023 is going to be an exciting year. John, we have our annual meeting where I turn over President and CEO, I guess I've already turned over President, but CEO to Chris. Wouldn't it be great Chris to have Unit 3 under our belt by then. You guys are going to love Womack funny story I tell everybody when I first got this job, I have always been friends of his but admired his wisdom, intelligence, his work ethic, his can-do attitude. And the very first thing I did when I got the job was move his office from down the hall right next to mine. And I can tell you that Chris has been a thought leader and a partner of mine throughout my tenure. He'll be ready to go day one to carry this company forward, and when you look at people like Kim Greene and Stan Connally and Jim Carr and all the -- and Jeff people and all the other people that are in these positions. I think it's an awfully strong team. It's the envy of our industry an embarrassment of riches in some respects. And I think Southern, especially post-Vogtle, is going to be a bit like a rocket ship, if I could say that. We're going to be doing great. So thank you all. It's been a pleasure knowing you all and working with you, and we'll see you soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Kathy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 27, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, President of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack. Christopher Womack : Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am delighted to be joining you today on my first earnings call as President of Southern Company. I've enjoyed given the opportunity to interact with many of you over the last couple of months and look forward to meeting with many more of you in the months ahead. I am incredibly excited about the future of Southern Company, the energy industry and the valuable work that we're doing to serve our customers and communities. I am excited about the opportunities ahead of us and proud to be a part of a team that is making such a significant impact in building the future of energy. As you've watched us reposition our deep talented bench across the system, our mission remains unchanged, provide our customers and communities with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy, while continuing to keep our customers at the center of everything we do. Also unchanged is our goal to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return. And I believe our financial plan supports that objective. The strength of our value proposition is a function of our customer and community, focused business model, the robust economic growth in our service territories and the constructive regulatory frameworks in our states. It is also a function of our discipline as we remain committed to our objectives of strong investment-grade credit ratings with a regular, predictable and sustainable dividend policy. Along with our focus on long-term execution and value accretion, we are executing on our plans as we -- and believe we're well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2023.  Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for our financial update. Daniel Tucker : Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted EPS was $0.79 per share, $0.18 lower than the first quarter of 2022 and $0.09 above our estimate. The major driver for the variance to last year was milder-than-normal weather as the first quarter of 2023 was the warmest on record in the Southeast. Higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense also impacted earnings for the first quarter compared to last year and were somewhat offset by constructive state regulatory actions. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. When looking at adjusted EPS impact compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers were a strong start for our state regulated natural gas utilities and continued strong electric and gas customer growth. Given the mid-February timing of our last earnings call, we were able to factor milder than normal January and February weather into our estimate for the quarter, so weather was not a major driver of our performance versus our estimate. You may recall that our adjusted earnings in the first half of 2022 were significantly better than projected due to weather and other market-driven factors. Our early 2022 outperformance supported our full year adjusted EPS performance and enabled us to accelerate maintenance activities in several areas of the business. Those initiatives had us well positioned with additional spending flexibility entering 2023, such that we expect the significant weather impact we experienced in January and February should be manageable over the remainder of the year, assuming a return to more normal weather throughout the balance of the year. Turning now to retail sales in the economy. In the first quarter, weather-normal electric retail sales were 0.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022. This increase reflects stronger residential and commercial sales from continued robust net in migration to our service territories, a strong labor market and a return to more normal business trends. Industrial sales for the quarter were down 1.6% as we are beginning to see weakness in housing-related sectors, such as stone clay and glass, lumber and textiles due to inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. Half of the industrial variance for the quarter compared to last year can be attributed to the closure of a caustic soda manufacturing facility in Alabama. Excluding the impact of this single customer, industrial sales were down approximately 0.8%. In a trend that continues to differentiate our Southeast service territories from many other areas of the country, we once again saw record levels of economic development activity with job creation and capital investment announcements at all-time highs in the first quarter. We are beginning to see supplier announcements related to the Rivian and Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing facilities in Georgia, with 6 supplier announcements made during the quarter, totaling over 4,200 jobs and nearly $2 billion in capital investment. We expect additional automotive supplier announcements in the coming months. Beyond the automotive industry, QCells recently announced a new $2 billion solar panel and component manufacturing facility in Georgia, which is expected to create 2,000 jobs. Additionally, the Port of Savannah continues to set records, posting its highest national market share ever and second busiest February on record. The port continues to expand capacity, including the recent announcement of the addition of 55 electric cranes, which are expected to eliminate 500,000 gallons of diesel consumption and related emissions per year. Before I turn the call back over to Chris, I'd like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.80 per share. This action marks our 22nd consecutive annual increase and for 76 consecutive years, dating all the way back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record supports Southern Company's value proposition. And lastly for me, our adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter is $0.75 per share. Chris, I'll turn it back over to you. Christopher Womack : Thank you, Dan. Before taking your questions, I'd like to first provide an update on recent progress on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion time line and capital cost forecast for both units are unchanged from the updates that we provided last quarter. Since that time, we've seen sustained progress consistent with our expectations for each unit. At Unit 3, we've achieved initial criticality in March and successfully synced to the grid earlier this month. We continue to work through final startup testing and commissioning and are currently performing testing at the 50% thermal power plateau. This testing is expected to continue in the coming weeks with extensions to higher power plateaus and force trips to test the unit's safety systems. Following completion of this final testing sequencing, and consistent with our long-term plans, we expect Unit 3 to enter into a brief maintenance outage window before returning to full power. After the successful completion of all appropriate preoperational and power extension testing, as well as any necessary fine-tuning, Unit 3 will be ready for commercial operations. We continue to project placing Unit 3 in service in May or June of 2023. Turning now to Unit 4. Substantial progress continued throughout the last quarter, with hot functional testing commencing in March, with lessons learned from Unit 3 continuing to benefit our execution on Unit 4, hot functional testing is approximately 80% complete. We have already achieved peak planned output of the test and are currently in the process of cooling the unit back down with progress throughout the test that has been consistent with our plan. We project to complete hot functional testing in the coming weeks to be followed by planned inspections and surveillance, along with the middle of our final ITAAC's receipt of the 103(g) finding from the NRC and fuel load later this year. Only 6 systems remain for turnover to testing for Unit 4, and we continue to project an in-service date between late fourth quarter of 2023 and end of the first quarter 2024. We look forward to sharing our exciting progress in the weeks and months ahead as we bring these units online to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to the benefit of our customers in the State of Georgia for decades to come. In closing, I'd like to highlight that Southern Company was named the top utility on Forbes Magazine Best Large Employers in America 2023 rankings. We ranked nearly 100 places higher than the next industry peer and the top 15 of the 500 large employers ranked for the second consecutive year. Being recognized amongst the best in the nation once again is an honor. This accolade is particularly gratifying because it is directly based on employee feedback. We are committed to creating a workplace where all groups are well represented, included and fairly treated with all -- within all levels of the organization and that everyone feels welcome, valued and respected. At Southern Company, we aspire to be a leader in our industry. As such, we will continue to strive to create the best workplace possible for our thousands of team members who work tirelessly each and every day to provide world-class service to the customers that we have the privilege to serve.  Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research. Steve Fleishman : Hey, good afternoon, Chris. Congrats on your first call in a new role. And hi to Tom out there, I'm sure he's listening. But the -- just on -- could you just remind us for the prudency filing in Georgia, when that would -- when that comes and roughly when that's going to be scheduled this year? Christopher Womack : It is scheduled to come as we enter fuel load on Unit 4. Right now, we're looking to -- for unit -- for fuel load to occur in the July time frame. So we're working -- we'll work with the commission and the staff on moving through that process. But it will get started as we enter fuel load on Unit 4. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And take like -- I think most things take 6 months pretty much in Georgia? Christopher Womack : We expect yes, 6 months. It's the time frame we expect today. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then I think -- I know you mentioned the remaining process for Unit 3 start-up, but just the testing so far -- I mean, obviously, you kept the time line, but so far in the testing, is it fair to say everything's gone as planned? Are there any issues that have come up? Just any color there. Christopher Womack : And Steve, I think as you've seen before, things do come up. I would say testing has gone very well. We've experienced some trips and the systems operated as they should, but we worked our way through it. And -- but we continue to proceed and move ahead. So, so far, so good, but we know there's -- first time start-up, there's always issues. This is why we test, and we're focused on the secondary side. But I'd say so far, so good, but we continue to -- testing is always a process that we'll go through to make sure we're ready for commercial operation. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Chris, you guys recently just around the '24 guidance, you kind of lowered it on the back of ongoing inflation and interest rates. I guess how are you seeing things develop now? And do you see kind of opportunities to manage your exposure like we saw with the prior convertible note you issued in February got a bit of a better sales outlook today. I guess what are some of the pushes and takes since you revised that '23 guide? It seems like there's some incremental tailwinds here. Christopher Womack : Shar, you asked is about '23 or '24. Shar Pourreza : '24. Christopher Womack : Okay. So I'm going to -- let me start, and then I'll kick it to Dan. We moved the lower end of our band down because as we pushed out I expected start-up of commercial on Unit 4. We moved that. We lowered the range down to [3.95]. So that was based on the push on the schedule Unit 4. Dan, do you want to comment on any other aspects of guidance? Daniel Tucker : Yes. And just following on to what Chris said, once we have clarity, which again will be the end of this year, early next year on Unit 4, we'll narrow that 2024 guidance down to something that's more akin to what we typically do, around a $0.10 range or so based on the actual in-service date. All the other moving parts you mentioned, Shar, I mean, we kind of are where we were -- we are executing in a way to make sure that we're managing where we need to. We'll continue to be creative and thoughtful around how we're financing, particularly at the parent company. I think the convertible deal was a tremendous success. We'll see what other opportunities we have, not necessarily that specific instrument, but just to be opportunistic in the way we do that. And then from a cost perspective, everyone is seeing pressures, and we are no different. But we've got a lot of efforts underway to make sure that we're running the business as efficiently as we can in a way that continues to support that guidance range. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then just, Chris, I'm kind of curious maybe just your overall thoughts on the cost side because Southern doesn't really have a stated cost-cutting target like some of your peers despite obviously you guys managing O&M fairly well. I guess, looking at things kind of from a fresh lens, are you seeing opportunities to cut cost incremental to your current plan maybe at the holdco level like shared services or even at the opcos? I mean, I guess, is there any opportunities you see as a new CEO that could be additive to plan as we're thinking about maybe further streamlining the business? Christopher Womack : Yes. And Shar, I would say it's a wonderful question I'd build on what Dan has said. I mean, we will continue to look at how we can run this business more efficiently. I mean there are opportunities to create shared service opportunity to find efficiencies in places, we will do that. As you know, there's a lot of conversation and interest in, and we take it very soon to the issue of affordability. And so we will continue to find ways to put downward pressure on our pricing, find ways to look at the interest rate and inflation implications, but look to find ways to make sure, from O&M perspective, that is either flat or declining over our forecast period. So we will continue to do that and pursue those kind of opportunities. And we've done it in the past, and we'll continue to do it in the future. Daniel Tucker : And I'd say, in addition to the -- particularly the shared service opportunities, as Chris mentioned, 1 of the other great opportunities we have, which you'd hope we would have is to really optimize how our internal resources are deployed between operating expenses and capital investments. So we're certainly doing everything we can to optimize the way they're deployed to focus on our capital spend and reduce costs at the same time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ross Fowler with UBS. Ross Fowler : So Dan, I just want to go through the seasonality again, you kind of brought it up in your prepared remarks, but I just want to make sure I fully understand your drivers there. You hear about -- you had a little over $2 in the first half of '22, and you've got a little over $1.50 in the first half of '23. So if I heard you correctly, you said that, that outperformance in '22 allowed you to pull a lot of O&M forward into the year, so that's part of it. But there's other pieces here, too, I think 1 would be a reduction in part of the Vogtle penalty once Unit 3 goes in. And then I think there was some sharing outside the band in Q4 of last year. So other than those 3 pieces, is there anything I'm missing around sort of getting back into the guidance range with a better second half number this year versus last? Daniel Tucker : Yes, not in terms of getting back, but just in terms of making those comparisons year-over-year, Ross, I think the other important moving part that we saw in the first half of last year that really helped us get up to that strong start was earnings that were really driven by where energy prices were. So not only on our regulated side, we had some commercial industrial pricing that benefited from that, but also on the Southern Power side got off to a great start just because of where market energy prices where and it allowed us to do a lot of those things. So when you're doing a year-over-year comparison, that will be a difference. Big thing that you brought up that's just not as obvious always looking at this is the kind of rebates or refunds back to customers' notion. That was a significant element of the second half of last year if you combine all of our jurisdictions in terms of either what was accrued to refund back to customers or what was put into regulatory reserves, so we have the reliability reserves in some of our jurisdictions. That was $0.33 just in the fourth quarter. And so that's a pretty significant year-over-year reconciling item that will necessarily be there this year, but we'll still be able to support that $3.60 as a midpoint. Ross Fowler : And then on the industrial sales decline, you mentioned about half of that was sort of a one-off item due to the caustic soda facility, and the rest was kind of like seen in lateral housing-related sectors. Maybe ex-housing, what are you seeing for the economic backdrop currently in that context? Daniel Tucker : Yes. Still, and I want Chris to kind of add on to this. But just from an overall sales perspective, still seeing year-over-year growth in a lot of sectors. There is a bit of slowing going on, but the overall strength here in the Southeast continues to show itself. Chris, do you want to add anything there? Christopher Womack : Yes. And so we look at the economic development pipeline here in the Southeast, which remains to be robust, I mean I look at first quarter of '23 versus the first quarter of '22 and announced projects expect like 10,000 -- 10-plus thousand jobs and some $4 billion of investment here in Georgia and in Alabama also sees increases around EV and battery supply chain. And the pipeline continues to be very full. So we continue to be excited about the economic activity, the economic development pipeline from population growth, in migration to the customer growth, we saw somewhere 11,000 on the electric side, some 6,000 on the gas side. So we continue to see very positive factors that -- some people say there may be a recession, but we think here in our territory maybe lessen because of this ongoing continuing economic strength and economic activity that we continue to see. Ross Fowler : That's great, Chris. And maybe this is an unfair question, but I'm going to pose it anyway. How do you think about -- I mean, you've seen in the press this week an EPA power plant rule potentially coming around natural gas and emissions reductions. How do you think about that in terms of sustainability achievement versus affordability and reliability because natural gas is definitely needed for both of those things as we walk through the energy transition? What are the risks and opportunities around that type of regulation? Christopher Womack : Yes. And let me break that up in two parts. I mean I think in terms of the proposal using the process before, and that will go through a number of different iterations. And when there is a final rule, we'll assess it in understanding and figure out what it means to us. I mean, we have been pursuing our fleet transition, our focus on sustainability and with a real commitment of balancing affordability with sustainability and moving toward to our net zero. I mean -- and we'll continue to do that as we go through this fleet transition. So our path will continue. And so whenever a new rule comes out, we'll take a look at it. I mean, I would also say I think for the economy, natural gas is very important. Natural gas is important to this country and to the economy to a lot of regions that cannot, from an affordability standpoint, make a transition to all electric. And so I think, from a national energy policy standpoint, I think it's important to recognize the importance of natural gas as we go forward. So that would be my response to that question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Congrats, again. So with that said, look, I want to pivot back to the credit conversation. As we kind of pivot out of the U3, U4, you look at the time lines getting a little bit narrower here. What are you guys thinking today about the prospects of credit improvement? What kind of metrics would you want to target? Obviously, you've seen some gyrations there through the course of construction -- how far do you want to go on that improvement side? What does that mean in terms of the targeted broad metrics? Again, I get that the rating agencies have different metrics they target? And then ultimately, what does that translate to in terms of target FFO for you guys? And the time line they're in, right, as you look at this in service? Daniel Tucker : Yes, Julien, it's Dan. So look, with -- once Unit 3 and 4 is in service, reflected in rates from a cash flow perspective, and we've talked about this before, it's about a $700 million improvement in our operating cash flow and thus improvement in FFO from an FFO to debt perspective, what that means is given the rest of our business, combined with that improvement, we should be comfortably in a let's just call it, 7-ish zone from an FFO to debt. It could be as high as 18 in years, could be in the high 16s, but comfortably above certainly current rating thresholds. And what I've continued to articulate as an objective to have all of our regulated utilities in the A category and our parent company at BBB+. And I think we can achieve that without having to do anything but execute. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Right. But that a further improvement in terms of the underlying metrics per se? Daniel Tucker : Absolutely. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Okay. And then, sorry, if I can pivot 1 more subject here. Just to touch on Georgia and Georgia Power, specifically around solar opportunities. I know that IRA has unlocked certain opportunities. I know that this isn't in flight in the process of maybe not necessarily right. But prospects for investing on that front. Obviously, you've had the Southern Power placeholder, but I'm focused more specifically on solar at Georgia Power and/or any of the other opcos today post IRA. And given the RFP? Christopher Womack : Yes. And Julien, as you know, we have opportunity as a result of the 2022 integrated resource plan, but also with the, inflation reduction act, we think as a level of the playing fields between -- from tax policy, it offers us the opportunity to own renewables ourselves. And so our teams are looking at the opportunities, and we'll be working with the commissions to pursue those opportunities for us to build and own more renewables as we go forward, taking advantage of the opportunities that the inflation Reduction Act affords us. And the opportunity we have is not just looking at the lease cost, but also -- but who's the best cost owner of these projects going forward. So it's a wonderful opportunity for us. But also, I think, as you mentioned, there're also opportunities for Southern Power as we go forward. So there are wonderful opportunities for us as we go forward, and we're looking forward to fully investigating and executing around them. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. But maybe in the next quarter or so, we'll get a little bit more detail there? Christopher Womack : We'll keep you posted. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : A couple of quick questions on the Vogtle units. I was wondering when would we expect Unit 3 to be running at full capacity? We've seen it ramping up and down, getting to 50% power. Wondering when we might see it at full capacity. And then just on that Unit 2, have the -- I think you touched on this before, but has the testing and running so far been going smoothly enough to not push out any like incremental delays within the May to June time frame? Christopher Womack : No. And so David, we're not announcing any schedule or cost estimate increases. 100% power sometime in May. I mean, we're working through the process. We're doing all the testing and we're ramping up. I would say, look for some time in May to get to 100% power. David Arcaro : Okay. Got you. And then on Unit 4, just during hot functional, I guess, similar question. Have you seen any issues pop up during that testing phase that would add incremental time even within the 4Q to 1Q 2024 window? Christopher Womack : And I think as we said, we're about 80% complete on hot functional on Unit 4. And I think it is clear that we have taken lessons learned from our Unit 3 experience, and there are no issues to note. And so I'd say, so far, so good. And I mean, if you recall, you may recall, Unit 3 took us about 94 days. And so we're now 80% complete. And if we stay on schedule, sometime in early May we will conclude hot functional testing and then look toward critical path items of ITAAC's and testing and looking toward fuel load sometime in July. So, so far, so good. So that's kind of just -- that's where we are. But we've -- I mean the lessons learned from Unit 3, Unit 4, I think, are clearly reflecting in showing up as we go through hot functional testing on Unit 4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Q - Durgesh Chopra  Just first, Chris, you talked about the maintenance outage at Unit 3. I just want to confirm that's just standard process, right? That's not an added step based on... Christopher Womack : Yes, it's -- go ahead, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : No, that's it. Please go ahead. Christopher Womack : Yes. No, you're right. I mean it's a standard outage. I mean, there's some testing equipment that has to be removed and some things that we have learned. And so we'll fine-tune some things, maybe some remediation that will occur probably about a 10-day maintenance outage. But yes, I mean, it's standard and what's expected. Durgesh Chopra : Perfect. Thank you for clarifying that. And then maybe I can just pivot to the Georgia Power under-recovered fuel filing. I believe you made that in February. Just any initial stakeholder feedback there I know in the last call, we talked about perhaps offsetting some of that balance with lower gas prices going forward as we see it. Just anything you can share with us on that front would be great. Christopher Womack : As you may know, we reached a stipulation with the staff, and we're looking at about a 12% price increase on retail rates over 3-year period to recover that under-recovered fuel balance, and that would take effect in June. And that is lower than what our initial request was and 30% less than what we expected. And I think as we look at this outcome, this stipulation, it reflects kind of our sensitivity and our interest in paying attention to affordability and recognizing that we must recover this under-recovered fuel balance, but how do we do it in a manner that minimizes the impact on customers. And so that's kind of where we are. More hearings and consideration to take place, but the rates will take effect starting in June. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Sophie Karp : Most of my questions have been answered actually. Let me just maybe throw this 1 at you guys. With Vogtle moving towards the completion Unit 3 and Unit 4 and remain on track to be completed in the direct line of vision. Would you take some time in the medium term to have another look at the businesses that you own and maybe figure out which ones could be recycled capital wise and optimize the business mix? Or are you quite happy with what you guys right now? Christopher Womack : I mean, I think you kind of speak to it. But as we have success on Vogtle 3 and 4, it does give us the opportunity to unlock the fuel value of this company and kind of regain our premium valuation. And I mean, we will look at our business, and we'll look at all parts of it in terms of from a buyer and seller perspective. And the thing about it is, I say, we've got -- and we will always look our handover. We feel real good about the cards that we have. I mean we'll always do our homework, and we look at what others have extracted in the marketplace. But we'll also look and see some things we can do better. We don't have any equity needs. I mean we're in a very, very good spot. And so I just think it's an opportunity for us to really unlock full value and the full potential of this company as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Agnieszka Storozynski : So I'll ask a bit for question. So we actually be willing to acquire some assets now that you have seemingly a clean slate. You mentioned you have no equity needs. You have a strongly improving cash flow, and there are assets available for sale. For now, the way we look at you guys, you've basically sold for roughly the sector average earnings growth, which I cannot believe that you would be happy with. Christopher Womack : Angie, I'll tell you, and I think I said it on the last answer to the last question. We are excited about the progress we're making through on these Vogtle units. And we're looking forward to bringing both units online and getting those units completed. Once we do that, I mean, we're really going to focus on really making sure that we are unlocking the full potential and the full opportunities for this business that we have, and we are large enough to do this as a stand-alone. At the same time, we're continuing to always look at our -- look at the market, look over our hand, as I said, from both a buyer and seller perspective. We'll always continue to do our homework. But we feel good about where we are. 5 to 7 is good enough for us to be the best risk-adjusted return in the industry, and we feel good about where we are. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Ashar Khan : Congratulations. My questions have been answered. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Christopher Womack : Guys, we thank you for being with us today. and we look forward to speaking with you in the future. But otherwise, operator, thank you very much for the call. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, August 3rd, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please, go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Tommy. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris Womack. Chris Womack : Thank you, Scott and good afternoon and thank you for joining us for what is such a pivotal and exciting time for our company. As many of you know, on Monday, we announced that Plant Vogtle Unit 3 successfully achieved commercial operation. While work remains to bring Unit 4 online, this incredible milestone is something to be celebrated. This decade-plus journey which involved development in global supply chain, managing through a global pandemic, tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers and millions of labor hours, combined with a group of committed co-owners and regulators that had the courage to support new nuclear power as an option when others didn't prove that we can accomplish monumental things when we share a common vision. Vogtle Unit 3 is now serving Georgia customers with over 1,100 megawatts, a 24-hour, seven-day a week carbon-free electricity. Turning now to Unit 4. Since our last call, the project team continues to make substantial progress as highlighted by completion of hot functional testing, receipt of all 157 fuel assemblies, so middle of all iTAC and most recently, receipt of the 103G finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission signifies acceptance criteria for Unit 4 have been met. The project team's current focus is working through final testing and system turnover to operations that when complete, will allow fuel load for Unit 4. Recall, as we contemplated in the VCM 17 order, Georgia Power can file his prudence request with the Public Service Commission following fuel load on Unit 4. Following fuel load, the project team will conduct final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electrical power production side of the plant. And achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for start-up activities and initial criticality. Importantly, the project capital cost forecast is unchanged since last quarter. and we continue to project Unit 4 will be placed in service between late fourth quarter 2023 and end of the first quarter 2024. The successful completion of this important project critical for George's and our nation's energy future. We look forward to these units providing reliable, carbon-free energy to customers for decades to come. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Dan Tucker : Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. For the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted earnings were $0.79 per share $0.04 higher than our estimate and $0.28 lower than last year. The primary drivers of our performance compared to last year were milder than normal weather conditions, higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense and changes in rates and pricing, somewhat offset by lower income taxes and O&M expenses. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2022 and is included in today's release and earnings package. Weather in our electric service territories during the first half of 2023 has been the mildest on record with the fewest aggregate degree days in the 129-year history of climate data reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more commonly known as NOA. The negative $0.16 per share EPS impact relative to our weather normal EPS guidance range is our largest ever negative weather-driven variance for the first six months of a year which is a significant headwind for the full year. While 2022 was a year in which we were able to fix the roof while the sun is shining and position the company well coming into 2023. We have been and will remain keenly focused on cost management, along with our constant focus on safety, reliability and customer satisfaction in the second half of this year. Our adjusted earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2023 is $1.30 per share. Turning now to retail sales in the economy. Year-to-date 2023, Weather-normal retail sales were in line with sales levels for the first half of 2022. We've seen positive residential and commercial growth and strong commercial usage offset by lower industrial sales. Year-to-date, we've added nearly 24,000 electric customers and 13,000 natural gas customers, trends which continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Chris Womack : Thank you, Dan. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that Southern Company was recently awarded the number nine overall spot on Forbes ranking of America's best employers for women. The highest ranking within our industry. We are honored to be selected to this list once again. Workforce and leadership diversity is a tenant of ours and ensures we have the variety of experiences and perspectives to better serve our customers. We will continue to emphasize a culture where all employees feel valued, respected and able to accomplish their professional goals. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you very much. And we'll proceed with our first question on the line is from Shahriar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Chris Womack : Shar good afternoon. Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning. Chris, that was the world record for the fastest prepared remarks. So, congrats here on that one. Chris Womack : Thanks. Always appreciate your comments and your analysis. And your perspective. Shahriar Pourreza : Just starting on George's economic backdrop. And obviously, you guys have seen a step change in the pace that major industrial customers have been announcing new capacity needs. How many, I guess, new gigawatts are you seeing now in Georgia versus the prior update with the state? What is the prior IRP embed? How should we sort of think about any updates to capacity needs, including the viability of the remaining coal assets as you're thinking about this incremental demand. So could we see a drastically different IRP being filed? Thanks. Chris Womack : And Shar, we're working through that analysis now. I think we have said to you before, and we've commented about all the wonderful conic development activity that we've seen across the state of Georgia over the past couple of years. Some 250-plus projects, $20-plus billion of investment, some 60,000 jobs that I know the governor has reported. So, I think we've talked about the impressive activity that seen. We've not turned that into the capacity needs at this time. That's some work that we're doing. And I'm sure forthcoming, we'll work with the commission on what all that means and then figure out what it means for us in terms of capacity needs going forward. But I think it's a little bit premature. Dan Tucker : Look, again, we're kind of going through the analysis, but it's fair to say what we've seen from economic development announcement perspective in the past is hundreds of megawatts at a maximum in a given year. And now we're having instances where it's thousands potentially in terms of the announcements. And so just the pace has accelerated. And you mentioned industrial, there's certainly a lot of large industrials involved with that, particularly around the electric transportation sector. but it's also data centers. It's a story that's playing out in a lot of places. Just as an example for ours. I mean, as we sit here today, data centers are roughly 2.5% of our overall electric load Five years from now, that will be well into the double digits in terms of percentage of our load. That's the pace of growth we're seeing. Chris Womack : We're very excited about it. I think it's a real positive contribution, positive factor that we're excited about here in the state. Shahriar Pourreza : Do you have a sense, Chris, on when you and Cam and Dan and the team could update us around that potential opportunity. I know it's really early in the process, but we're obviously seeing the amount of customers that are moving to Texas, and it's very material. So, I mean, to Georgia, which is really material. So, I'm just kind of curious on what the time? Chris Womack : Yes. Sure. I think it's a little bit premature. But as soon as we get to that point, and we figure out and have a conversation with the commission. I'm sure we'll share that with you share that with the industry. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. And then lastly, Chris, we're obviously approaching the prudency case once we see Unit 4 fuel load. Anything you can provide and how we should be thinking about a potential settlement, or should we be thinking about like a rate case? And whether the potential for like a special election could impact the process, if at all, especially if fuel load takes long to the plan. Chris Womack : Yes. Shar, I think there are a couple of questions. You embedded there together. First, around proven, we have to get the fuel load. Once we get the feel, we'll figure out what happens having transparency in the process is very important. But right now, once we get to fuel load, then we'll figure that out. We'll work with the commission and the staff on that process. I think the you made reference to the makeup of the commission, I mean, I -- the sense is that we'll get through prudence with the current commission. We have no idea what will happen in the Rose case, so we're still waiting for that order for that decision by the courts. But there's nothing more I can say about that decision at this point in time. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. Thank you, Chris and Dan. Very helpful. I appreciate it and congrats. Chris Womack : Thank you. Operator : And we'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Chris Womack : Carly how are you? Carly Davenport : Doing well. Thanks so much for taking the questions today. I appreciate it. Maybe just starting in terms of what we saw during the quarter for weather-normalized demand a little bit weaker on the industrial side, but commercial still looks quite strong. Can you just talk about how things are evolving relative to your forecast and kind of how you could see that evolving as we continue to move through the year? Dan Tucker : Yes, absolutely, Carly. And we saw this earlier this year as well. From an industrial perspective, we're seeing -- two different dynamics play out that are negatively impacting growth. And those -- one is the housing sector. So, when it comes to things like lumber, stone clean glass to a degree textiles, particularly where it involves carpet, just given the broader trends in the housing industry, we're seeing that impact some of our usage in the short-term. And then the other thing is chemicals from a an industrial perspective. So we've had one particular facility in Alabama that has slowed pretty significantly. Again, some of that was anticipated very early in the year, and so it's just playing out as we anticipated, just wasn't anticipated when we kind of put our forecast together right before the end of the year. What we're really encouraged by what we're seeing on the commercial and residential side. I spoke to the customer growth that we're seeing from a residential perspective, again, we've seen sustained levels well above what we were seeing pre-pandemic. And from a commercial perspective, just a lot of different stories playing out in that regard. Some of its economic development, some of it is this data center dynamic that I mentioned. And certainly, a lot of it is just commercial naturally following the residential growth. As it pertains to how it's impacting our results, what's important to remember is kind of the revenue contribution of these two classes on a relative basis. A 1% change in industrial sales is only about $20 million of impact here as a 1% change in residential and commercial is more like $40 million to $50 million. So in terms of a net implication for us, we're getting the benefit of the residential commercial more than offsetting what we're seeing on industrial. Carly Davenport : Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just on the financing front in the context of the current rate environment. Just you've got some financing kind of still outstanding for the rest of this year. Just how are you thinking about execution of the plan that you have as we move through 2023? Dan Tucker : Yes, Carly. Look, we're always going to kind of keep our options open, the flexibility. You've seen us do the convertible debt instrument early this year. We typically lean on an ongoing basis towards just senior unsecured stuff at the parent. Lot of different instruments we've used across the utility franchises. I wouldn't characterize anything in our plans as out of the ordinary. We're going to be monitoring the market and making sure we're being thoughtful about as we always are maturities about the mix between fixed and variable and like everyone is doing, monitoring the rates as actively as we can to make sure we're getting to the market when it makes sense. Carly Davenport : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Dan Tucker : You bet Carly. Thank you. Operator : And we'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America. Go right ahead. Chris Womack : Julien, how are you doing? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the time. Great. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it. Hey look, just coming back to the other subject here on procurement and renewables -- on the renewables front. I know we talked about this last quarter here. Curious to hear your latest thoughts, both on the utility side and ownership think that had always been kind of back half of this year. How is that looking on that front in Georgia? And then separately, I think, Dan, last time we connected here, you were talking about the Southern Power effort looking like it was a tad more competitive in this environment. in terms of your ability to actually win and accrue projects from that side of the house. Do you want to talk about some of the progress and maybe the evolution just with the rate environment where it is? Chris Womack : Yes, Julien, let me start with on the renewables front. As you know, in the 22 IRP, Georgia had another 2,100 megawatts of renewables approved doing that proceeding. The first IRP will begin later this year, targeting some 1,300 megawatts of renewable resources with operation dates between 2026 and 2027. I think you may have also seen Alabama Power guidance renewable generation certification modified some 2,400 megawatts over a six-year period. So I think that will also be later this year. So, we're proceeding and we're looking forward to opportunities for us to own some renewables. Clearly, we'll take advantage of the normalization of tax treatment between PTCs and ITCs and pursuing it from a best cost perspective. And we think we've got support from our commissions to for us to own more renewables. So, we're looking forward to those processes as they proceed later this year. I think your other question, Dan, you want to talk about pricing? Dan Tucker : Well, I think the other question was around Southern Power and yes, Julian, the same continues to hold true. The radar screen of active, viable opportunities for Southern Power is as strong as it's ever been. And look, we fully expect to be able to continue to deploy capital in the right way there. We'll keep the same discipline we've always had in terms of the hurdles we look for, the risk profile, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparty, but I think my short message there on Southern Power would just be stay tuned. There's good things happening. Chris Womack : So bottom line, Julien, I think we're very optimistic on the regulated side of what the future holds for renewables. And we'll see how that plays out -- begin to play out later this year? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then just as you think about the generation needs that the prior questioners have been really kind of poking at here, aligned with, as you alluded to a second ago, the added ability to own some of this renewable generation through utility tax credit optimization, if you will. Can you talk about that opportunity coming together and maybe specifically the time line that you could see that starting to play itself out? I know we just alluded to the prior IRP cycle, but getting the CapEx proposals, RFPs and ultimately just seeing that load forecast updated? Chris Womack : Yes, Julien, once again, I think it's a little premature in that regard. Clearly, as I spoke to earlier, about the renewable process and the RFPs, we see that forthcoming later this year. Clearly, we've got some more work to do as we -- as we analyze the implications of the second night development activity and what is meaningful for loads. And so we simply right now need to let the RFP process play out. over the next few months and next few years. But we'll keep you updated as we move through the process. Dan Tucker : Yes. As we've said before, consistent with what Chris just said, this will come together from a plan and capital deployment perspective in the latter part of our forecast horizon. So it was not a 2023 thing in terms of capital deployment might but probably not a meaningful 2024 -- but beyond that is where the real opportunity exists. And the other thing that's coming together to help drive this. And I think you mentioned the economic development aspect, Julian, as all these customers are choosing to locate in our service territories, they are increasingly demanding to be served with renewable generation, and that's just helping support everything we're trying to do. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I hear you. Wish you guys best block and I hope to see you guys soon. All right. Take care. Chris Womack : All right, Julian. Operator : Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Go right ahead. Chris Womack : Hey Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good afternoon. Just want to see, I guess, with start-off Vogtle here, some of the issues at the finish line gear, just wondering what learnings you take away from that? And do you see the same type of issues materializing for Unit 4 or there weren't here that can kind of head off any issues like that? Chris Womack : And Jeremy, one of the things we've commented for -- we set a prior for a few years now that there would be lessons learned as we transfer over from unit 3 to unit 4. Let me just give you some examples of how that is playing out. On Unit 3 hot functional testing took 94 days on Unit 4. It took 88 days. It move forward from 94 -- took 42 days. Hot functional testing to complete to 103G was 371 days on Unit 3, 88 days on Unit 4. And from coal hydro, to hot functional test start was 191 days on Unit 3 to 103 days on Unit 4. So, I think you're seeing clear examples of how lessons are being learned from Unit 3 over Unit 4. And that that work -- those lessons learned will continue, I think, to show itself as we move through Unit 4. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And -- just kind of pivoting here. I think you saw that the D.C. core overruled for its approval of the Southeast Energy exchange market, just what do you make up this year? And what's the path forward? Chris Womack : Yes. I mean, it remanded it back to FERC to clarify a couple of issues around the power pool, and there are some questions about who is who could participate in and seeing that it has to be interconnections. So I think they're simply remanded back for clarification of a couple of issues, but nothing big there. I mean seeing continues to operate and performed very well. Everybody is very pleased with the results we've seen. So, it will be -- it's going to be remanded back to FERC, like I said, with a couple of issues that they'll clarify for seen going forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And just last one, if I could. What are you expecting on hydrogen reg from treasury? And what do you think Southern Power's potential to participate could be with Vogtle and the potential for green hydrogen? Chris Womack : Let me say something quickly about hydrogen, and I'll let Dan touch on any rules from treasury. We're participating in a number of processes DOE has with hydrogen hub. So we're excited about that. As you may recall, we did a 20% blend at our Platt McDonough Gas site. So we're excited about all the technology activity and the considerations that are going on around hydrogen. We look forward to seeing if we can develop this market and get the pricing right, get the transportation of the product right and then we can find off-takers. I mean, so we're thrilled by the possibility and how Vogtle can continue to serve customers in Georgia. So there are a lot of aspects of hydrogen that we get really excited about. Clearly, there's a lot of work that's got to be -- that we've got to work through to get to that point to make it viably commercial -- commercially viable. A \u2013 Daniel Tucker : Yes. And Jeremy, in terms of the treasury rig, certainly, like most in the industry, I think for us, it makes sense that those are as broad as possible going in to help kind of drive the deployment of the technology. Otherwise, it just may be cost prohibitive for a lot of people to get it out there. And whether that's a permanent broadness or it's a temporary broadness that transitions to something more specific, I think that's going to be in the hands of the Treasury Group. In terms of Southern Power's opportunity to play there, certainly, Southern Power's wheelhouse is providing utility scale, renewable generation to counterparties. And to the extent that we find opportunities in this space to serve an electrolyzer or another entity with a long-term contract, and it's a creditworthy counterparty, and it meets all of the same criteria. It certainly expands our universe of opportunities. Q \u2013 Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. I leave it there. Thanks. A \u2013 Daniel Tucker : Thank you. Operator : And we'll get to our next question on the line is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. A \u2013 Christopher Womack : Hey, Dave. A \u2013 Daniel Tucker : How are you, David? David Arcaro : Hey, good. Thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you might be able to touch a little bit on Forum Energy [ph]. You had an agreement reached to Georgia Power this quarter. I was wondering how you're thinking long duration energy storage might play a role in your system over time? . A \u2013 Christopher Womack : Once again, we're excited about the relationship that we've established with Forum. We have utilized the kind of 4- to 6-hour batteries we think a 100-megawatt -- 100-hour loan duration storage battery on 15 megawatts has got to be a part of the mix and it's got to be a part of the system and the grid going forward. So -- we're excited about what Forum is doing. We were at their ground breaking ribbon cutting up in West Virginia a month or so ago. So we are excited about Forum and looking forward to their development as we go forward. But we think this has got to be a part of the technology mix as we go forward, and we're hoping they're going to be successful. As you know, we pay a lot of attention to research and development. And we think as we look at a lot of solutions, whether it's submissions control or just making sure we maintain a reliable and resilient grid, we think technology advancement is very, very critical. And so -- we're excited about the work that form is doing, and we're glad to partner with them. Q \u2013 David Arcaro : Great. That makes sense. And then secondly, obviously, a big weather headwind that you're working through. And could you touch on the cost control -- just your confidence level in being able to manage and find flex in your O&M budget for this year? And where are the key areas that you're looking at in terms of offsetting the headwind so far? A \u2013 Christopher Womack : Yes. I think -- and Dan said it in the conversation earlier that we'll remain keenly focused on cost management. And so we've got to correspond with that with similar focus on cost management. And so there are a number of efforts going on across the company to make sure that we are executing around cost management controls. And right now, we feel good about where we are, but we know we've got a lot more work to do as we go forward through the rest of the year. David Arcaro : Okay. Understood. Congratulations on Vogtle Unit 3. And thanks again. I appreciate it. Chris Womack : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll get our next question on the line. It is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good afternoon guys. 7 minutes and 58 seconds of prepared remarks. I'll keep it real brief, hopefully. Just following up on David's question. So this quarter, we had $0.04 of unfavorable weather versus normal, but you actually delivered $0.04 higher than your estimates. Is that all just cost cuts, or are there other things that we should think about onetime or and other things? Dan Tucker : Yeah. It's primarily cost reductions, Durgesh. I mean there's always some little puts and takes here and there that are a little different than our forecast. But overall, it's just the fruit of our labor. And going back to Dave's original question in terms of where, frankly, be doing a disservice to highlight any particular area of the business where we're doing that because we're doing it everywhere. This is a significant lift, and we're doing everything we need to do and pulling out all the stops to deliver. Durgesh Chopra : Okay, solid. And then just maybe if you can, otherwise, I'll just follow up with Scott. Just any initial takes on July weather? Dan Tucker : It hasn't looked like the first half. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you very much. We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line. It\u2019s from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Go ahead. Nick Campanella : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Hope you're doing well, and congrats on the Unit 3 news. Chris Womack : Thanks Nick. Nick Campanella : Yes, absolutely. So just looking forward to Unit 4 soon and then knowing that we're getting closer to that $700 million uplift that you detailed in slides here on the CFO. Dan, maybe you can just remind us your preferred use of those cash flows as you roll forward your plan in the fourth quarter. And I know we talked about improving balance sheet in the past, but I'm also cognizant you're talking up a lot of different CapEx opportunities in your region? Dan Tucker : Yeah. Nick, and thanks for that question. It really is kind of all of the above strategy, if you will, in terms of the opportunity to use this cash. And the three things that we're primarily focused on, you said one, which is to fund the capital plan, right? So we'll be positioned as we had been historically kind of pre-penalty ROEs and heavy construction on BOGO 3 and 4, where our operating cash flow represents over three times the size of our common dividend. And so that leaves an awful lot of cash flow to deploy against this capital plan that we expect to continue to grow that\u2019s thing one, the number one priority of the things we're focused on, you also mentioned this is credit quality. And what this does is provide an uplift to our credit metrics such that we're more in the 17, 17-plus range for FFO to debt. And the opportunity there is not raise at these levels well-above our thresholds and then use that as some sort of currency to do things, that's the opportunity to just once again get back to being a premium credit utility and maintaining that position for the foreseeable future. So that's thing too. And then the third thing that we've talked a lot about is the opportunity that we'll have as our payout ratio gets, kind of, sustainably at or maybe a little below 70%, so called that maybe 2024, but more likely 2025, an opportunity to go to our Board and for Chris and I to make a recommendation to increase the rate of the dividend growth to be more aligned with our earnings growth. So it's, again, all of the above, but really important things that this enables us to do. Nick Campanella : All right. Thanks for that. That\u2019s it from me today. Appreciate it. Chris Womack : Thanks, Nick. Nick Campanella : Thank you. Operator : And we'll get to our next question on the line is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Go ahead. Chris Womack : Hi, Angie. Angie, how are you? Angie Storozynski : Very good. Thanks. So just -- you guys have been in this combat mode for the last for a decade or it feels like. And I know that there's still the prudence review ahead of you. But I'm just trying to picture southern -- and back to basics mode. So I mean, what does it even look like? So that's one. And number two is, I mean, you clearly -- the stock has re-rated somewhat. What is it that you think you can do? Well, besides just putting Unit 4 online to further re-rate the stock from here? Chris Womack : And Angie, let me start with the first part of your question in terms of being in combat mode doing this vogtle period. I'd say we're going to stay in combat mode in terms of execution. Yes, hopefully, we're going to be a little boring. We think boring is beautiful. But we're going to be incredibly aggressively focused on customers being at the center of everything that we do focus on the circle of life, making sure we're maintaining a constructive regulatory environment providing world-class service and using your language of in combat mode, but doing that in a very aggressive way that make sure we're giving customers what they need from a reliability, but also a resilient perspective, but also making sure we're paying attention to issues around portability. So we have a lot of work to do. And so we're going to be very singly focused on execution. And I think that's going to be very important as we also make the case that we deserve that premium valuation and returning back to the days of old Southern classic. Dan Tucker : It is no mistake and no accident that the first page of our deck has a circle of life one. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then just maybe a smaller point, but you guys have, just like everybody else, more violent and impact storms going through your service territory. Is there anything from one investment perspective to regulatory setup that could help you, you know, hardening the grid and also assure timely recovery of any costs associated with those would the climate change basically? Chris Womack : And I would say, I mean, if you look at our capital budget today and getting pass but with there are no really large projects, but it's a lot of blocking and tackling transmission distribution with grid improvement programs, with undergrounding, with changing out circuits and improving technology scale systems a lot of that work to enhance and improve reliability, but also improve resiliency so that storms are more different paying attention to more extreme weather, so doing the basic work to prepare for these kind of conditions and help us to maintain our focus on reliability and the resiliency of our system. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Chris Womack : Once again, let me thank everybody for your calls today. It's a wonderful time for Southern Company as we brought Unit 3 commercial and with the progress that we're making on unit and we'll continue to press ahead and move forward. But again, thank everybody for joining us today. Thank you very much, and everybody, be safe. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company second quarter 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect, and have a great rest of the day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded November 2, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Dina. Good afternoon, and welcome to The Southern Company's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Chris Womack : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us this afternoon. Our premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities and Southern Power continued to perform well during the third quarter. Plant Vogtle Unit 3 has continued to operate at 100% react to power since being declared in service July 31, and we expect to deliver on our adjusted financial targets for 2023. Before Dan provides an overview of our financial results, I'd like to provide an update on several announcements since our last call. First, we continue to see economic growth across our Southeast service territories. We are excited about the important role our utilities play and attracted new jobs and investment to our states and communities and are proud of the recent recognition for those efforts as Alabama Power and Georgia Power will each named a top utility for economic development by Site Selection magazine. With Georgia Power's recognition representing the 25th consecutive year for this honor. Last Friday, Georgia Power filed an update to its integrated resource plan. Economic development in Georgia has accelerated over the past couple of years and is contributing to extraordinary projected electricity usage growth, which is significantly larger than historic levels. Electric transportation, manufacturing and its supporting supplier base have been major contributors to the state's success along with new data centers to support increased computing power needs and the growing digital economy. With this 2023 IRP update, Georgia Power is proposing additional investments into Georgia's energy future to provide economical energy solutions that should benefit our customers and communities for generations to come. Building upon the plan approved in Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, the 2023 IRP update seeks to continue the utilization of a diversified approach to help ensure resilience, reliability and flexibility on behalf of customers, and Georgia Power has requested that the Georgia Public Service Commission evaluate this update by the end of April 2024. In late September, Southern Power announced the acquisition of the 150-megawatt South Cheyenne Solar facility in Wyoming and the 200-megawatt Millers Branch solar facility in Texas. Commercial operation of the facilities is expected in 2024 and 2025, respectively. These projects represent Southern Power's 29th and 30th solar facilities, which are the newest additions to a portfolio of 5,500 megawatts of carbon-free generating capacity. Consistent with the project in Southern Power's existing portfolio, these new projects include long-term contracts and counterparties with strong credit support. Additionally, Alabama Power's Barry Unit 8 was successfully placed in service yesterday on schedule and on budget. This 720-megawatt combined cycle unit is expected to be one of the most efficient natural gas plants in the country. Consistent with the proposed resource plan in Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update, we believe we are well positioned to continue applying our expertise and experience in constructing new natural gas and renewable generating units to serve our region's growing needs. Last week, we announced a memorandum of understanding between Southern Company and the U.S. General Services Administration to develop carbon-free electricity solutions for federal facilities across our Southeast service territory. The agreement documents our intent to collaborate on development of a road map that when executed will lead to federal agencies buying more carbon-free electricity in the region. We view this exciting partnership as another important contribution towards Southern Company's goal of reaching net zero by 2050. And finally, last Wednesday, we issued our annual sustainability summary highlighting the great progress that we made as we continue to advance clean energy, lead through innovation, invest in our people and serve and elevate the communities that we have the privilege to serve. We have worked with our states, customer groups, communities, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders to develop strategic solutions to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to serve our growing economies. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Dan Tucker : Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of 2023, our adjusted earnings were $1.42 per share, $0.12 higher than our estimate -- $0.11 higher than last year. The primary drivers of our performance compared to last year were warmer than normal weather conditions, changes in rates and pricing and lower income taxes and O&M expenses, somewhat offset by higher depreciation and amortization. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our adjusted earnings per share were $3.01 compared to adjusted earnings per share of $3.35 for the same period in 2022. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, adjusted earnings per share are $0.34 below the same period a year ago, with the extremely mild weather conditions we experienced in the Southeast during the first six months of 2023, representing a major factor in how this year has developed. While weather conditions continue to present risk to our fourth quarter results, we project to achieve our full year adjusted earnings near the middle of our guidance range of $3.55 to $3.65 per share. Our adjusted estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.59 per share, which implies an estimated full year result of $3.60 on an adjusted basis. Turning now to electricity sales in the economy, year-to-date 2023 weather-normal retail electricity sales were approximately 0.5% lower than sales levels for the first nine months of 2022. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 35,000 electric customers and 19,000 gas customers, trends which continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels. Strong commercial usage was offset by a return to office dynamic and residential sales as the relationship between these two customer groups appears to have largely reached pre-pandemic status. Lower industrial sales continued to be driven by weakness in the chemical, paper and housing-related sectors. More broadly, our service territories are in a period of industrial transition particularly as it pertains to manufacturing. Historically, significant industries such as paper and chemicals are making way for the manufacturing of solar panels, batteries, airplanes and electric automobiles. As Chris mentioned earlier, during 2023, we have continued to see an extraordinary level of economic development activity within our service territories. While we will provide formal updates to our outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we did want to highlight the magnitude of potential change we are seeing in electricity sales growth. Recall, our previous forecast assumed annual electricity sales growth of 0% to 1%. Factoring in the power needs of these new, highly data-centric businesses and manufacturing facilities, electricity sales are likely to have an annual growth rate closer to a mid- to high single-digit range over the next five years. While there is likely to be significant incremental capital investment required to serve this level of economic development activity, we expect both existing and new customers to recognize economic benefits from this growth. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Chris Womack : Thank you, Dan. Before taking your questions, I'd first like to provide a brief update on our progress at Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Since successfully achieving commercial operations at the end of July, Unit 3 has performed well, delivering nearly 2.5 million megawatt hours of reliable carbon-free energy to the citizens of Georgia. On Unit 4, following fuel load and during start-up and preoperational testing, we discovered a motor fault in one of the four reactor coolant pumps, necessitating a full replacement of the pump with one from our spare parts inventory. We have successfully cleared the path in which the existing reactor coolant pump will be removed and expect to begin that activity in the coming days. Many preoperational activities continue along a parallel path with the pump replacement, including coatings, insight containment and preparation of the turbine for power ascension testing. After successful installation of the spare pump, we will recommence with start-up in preoperational testing with a projected in-service date during the first quarter of 2024. Also, in late August as part of the Vogtle 3 and 4 prudence process, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia Public Service Commission to adjust rates to include reasonable and prudent Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 cost. Related to this application, the Georgia Public Service Commission public interest advocacy staff filed a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power and several other intervenors, which is intended to constructively resolve all issues regarding reasonableness, prudence and cost recovery for the remaining Vogtle 3 and 4 costs, not already in base rates. The Georgia Public Service Commission is expected to vote on this matter on December 19. Again, thank you all for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Carly Davenport : Maybe just to start to pick up on your comments on Vogtle. I guess, first, just any expectations at this point in terms of the actual process of replacing the reactor coolant pump when you'd expect to get that wrapped? And kind of talk a little bit about maybe what gives you confidence still in that 1Q 2024 time line. And any factors that you're watching that could accelerate or decelerate that time line? Chris Womack : Carly, again, thanks for your questions. We look at the pumps at Unit 3, I mean, the four pumps are running as designed. And as we've seen this from Sanmen in China, so we've seen this experience in terms of replacement. So, we think we have a good path to replacing the pump. And so, we just feel good about the process that we've identified that is in place for removal and then replacing the spare pump. So, we feel very confident about the process and where we are with the pump replacement process at this time. Carly Davenport : Great. And then maybe just shifting to sort of some of the capital opportunities that Daniel alluded to facilitate this load growth that you're expecting to see across your territory, I guess, in the context of the interest rate environment, how are you thinking about managing financing the CapEx required to support that growth? And how you'd expect to balance between debt and equity going forward. Dan Tucker : Yes, Carly, it's a great question. And look, just order of magnitude, we'll provide specific guidance in February. But I think as we sit here today on the very front end of this IRP update process, we do see pretty substantial potential increases. And potentially, we're talking billions of dollars where our current five-year plan for capital is $43 billion. I think we easily see a plan that translates to something north of $45 billion, and it's really a question of how much higher than $45 billion once we get to February and kind of lay that out. And I say all that continuing to be conservative about including any owned renewables. We absolutely across all of our electric service territories expect to own renewables over the forecast horizon. But we're going to wait until there's better line of sight on those individual projects to include those. So getting to your question in terms of financing, we've been very clear about our credit objectives. And I think our profile is positioned to be differentiated, and it's our objective over the long term to preserve that differentiated profile. And so that will mean the potential for maybe turning on our equity plans. We're fortunate to have one of the largest, if not the largest drips in the industry. We can generate between $350 million and $400 million a year just through those. And then we always keep on the shelf and at the market program just to have flexibility. So, we will absolutely do what we need to do to preserve the credit profile in terms of the balance of how that's financed. I think it's still a fraction of any incremental capital that translates to equity. Again, I mentioned billions of capital and hundreds of millions of potential equity through the drip. I think that will be sufficient to maintain where we want to be. Carly Davenport : Great. If I could just sneak one follow-up on that point, Dan. Do you have any -- are there any targets that you have on the level of parent debt that you'd like to hold going forward? Dan Tucker : I think where we sit today, Carly, just kind of on an unadjusted basis, if you will, so not trying to factor in equity credit or content for any particular securities. We're a little south just of 30% overall. I think as the business grows, we don't really intend to grow that percentage. So, the absolute quantum of debt may increase over time, but the proportion of parent debt to the rest of our debt will remain about the same, I think. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Just a quick follow-up from the prior question. I guess, the opportunity set is pretty material, Dan, you're obviously highlighting it could be in the billions. I guess, how do we think about that opportunity set in relation to your 5% to 7%? So is this a scenario where it's accretive to growth or could be accretive to growth? Or is this sort of an extended runway scenario? Dan Tucker : Yes. Look, Shar, it's a great question. It's the right question. But Chris and I have been out speaking to the investment community for months well in advance of this filing with the Georgia Commission coming together and acknowledging that whether it's owned renewables, whether it's the kind of economic development growth that we -- and activity we've been seeing, potential for more capital has been lingering out there. But what we've both been very clear about is it's not our objective to raise the growth rate as a result of that. What this opportunity presents itself as is an opportunity to strengthen the profile of the growth rate to potentially sustain it longer term. And again, the important governor on all of this is really two factors : One, we're focused on the long term here. We're not trying to have some temporarily higher growth rate in the short term. And more importantly, number two, is customer affordability, making sure that we maintain a profile from a customer perspective that preserves the constructive regulatory environments, we're fortunate to have. The other great benefit of everything that we're seeing and the fundamentals that Chris and I are so excited about is this level of sales growth. That, in and of itself, will provide an opportunity to mitigate the affordability equation. Chris Womack : And Shar, one thing I'd add. I mean, you know us very well, you know our process. I mean we will kind of give you that '24 guidance in February of next year. I mean, so now we are looking at the headwinds, the tailwinds kind of where we are in terms of -- I mean, the cards that we have and what's in front of us, and we'll update and give you that guidance in '24. But I'd tell you, I mean, on the iconic development front, there are just a lot of exciting opportunities. We've got headwinds of interest rates, but we look forward to giving you that update in our call in '24 in February. Shar Pourreza : Just, Chris, thanks for kind of bringing that up a little bit just on -- just, I guess, on the parent level maturities, it's somewhat sizable over the next few years. So maybe can you just provide a little bit of the interest rate sensitivities, and I guess, how to manage those pressures, especially as we're thinking about '24 and I think you prior guided to right around that 395 to 415 range. So how do you manage that if you have a sensitivity there you can provide? Dan Tucker : Yes. Look, Shar, just like we did this year, we're going to kind of be thoughtful, creative, somewhat aggressive in terms of how we manage that. You saw us do the convert earlier this year that really mitigated the interest impact. We'll do everything kind of at our disposal to execute in a way that keeps rates as low as possible. I think what everyone is likely stepping back in the industry and saying is, look, we all knew interest rates were higher, and this sense of higher for longer as you sit here today, it's probably the longer piece that we all thought was perhaps not as long as what we're seeing as we sit here. But I think it's all consistent. And for us, kind of mitigated by this tremendous windfall of economic development activity we have. In terms of sensitivities, look, if you think about kind of a 50 basis point sensitivity around interest rates as we move forward, think with every incremental year, it's basically another an incremental penny of potential EPS plus or minus for that 50 basis points of interest rate sensitivity. And we're not interest rate forecasters. We're just basically using kind of public forecasts that are out there in terms of our planning. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. That was all I had. I appreciate it. Thanks for the color and see you about in a week. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Arcaro : Maybe starting on the load growth side of things first. When do you think you'll start to see that coming through in the quarter? I guess, the actual weather-normal sales were down over the last 12 months kind of a similar experience. So when do you think that inflection kind of comes to start to point the underlying electric load growth getting towards that upper single-digit level? Chris Womack : I think as we lay out the plan and what the needs are, probably in the '26 time frame, I think, we'll see some of this play out could be as late as '25. I mean as plants begin and they've got to be constructed. They've got to go online. So yes, we look at late '25, the early '26 time frame. I think before you will see this kind of show up in those increased sales? Dan Tucker : Yes. When you hear us talk about economic development activity and announcements, Dave, typically, that is three, four, five years from announcement time for facilities to get built, to get staffed to get trained and operating at a capacity that's meaningful to our load. David Arcaro : Yes, got it. That's helpful color and context there. And then -- was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on the pump issue on Unit 4. Does this look -- are there any indications that it could be a design issue with the pumps has this happened at other AP1000 units? Or does this look like it could just be a one-off here? Chris Womack : I think it's a little premature to say. I mean once we get it out, I mean, we'll get it back to the manufacturer to see actually what happened and we'll learn from that. But right now, our focus is on removal of the pump and then replacing it with a spare and then moving toward the process of putting the unit in service. So -- but yes, I mean, we'll take a hard look at, I mean what happened to the pump and we'll repair it and move forward. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Indeed, likewise, Chris. Look, let's talk about the upside CapEx just a little bit further here, if you don't mind. I keep bothering you on this here. Let's talk about first Alabama. To what extent is that going to be ripe for 4Q? And just also, how do you think about the ownership angle there as you think going forward, 2.6 gigs, I think that's over six years, not trivial there as well. When you were talking about billions of upside, was that inclusive of that LMM opportunity? Or is that upside to the upside if you want to use that service? Dan Tucker : It's upside to the upside, Julien. So again, and I mentioned this earlier, we're going to continue to be conservative on owned renewables that we absolutely have an expectation that will become part of the mix we're not going to forecast it until we have better line of sight on individual projects. And in Alabama, those will largely be tied to individual customer stories. When it comes to this economic development activity, while I think kind of the tip of the spear sit here today is what's happening in Georgia, there's a lot of momentum across the rest of our electric service territory for opportunities like this. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And just to clarify that, Alabama, that would be to the extent of which they're more directly negotiated here with customers that would be presumably entirely an ownership opportunity and then just to clarify Carly's question a little bit further, the FFO to debt piece of this, you're thinking about targeting like a flat level here, even pro forma for the DRIP. It's not like you're leaning into the balance sheet by only turning on the DRIP. It's that inclusive of that incremental capital, you'll still hit a fairly flat level, if you will? Dan Tucker : Yes. So on the first part, Julien, in terms of the mix of ownership -- and this is going to be true for all of our electric service territories. It will be a mix. We expect to own a meaningful amount, but there is likely to be third-party PPAs in the mix here, just like there has historically. So, that's the reason we're not including anything forecast. We don't want to be presumptuous as to exactly what that mix is. We just know or we have an expectation it will be meaningful. On the -- I'm sorry, what was the second question again, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Just in response to Carly's question, and you said something about sort of reengaging on the DRIP here, hundreds of millions of equity. When you think about that ratio of equity versus CapEx, are you thinking that you can keep the metrics relatively flat with that? Or are you kind of expecting that to use, if you will, some of the balance sheet capacity? Dan Tucker : Yes. I would call it flat, Julian. So, it's flat over the long term. Our credit quality is a buffer against adversity that we have no desire to consume nor do we have -- or are we positioned where we've got to kind of over equitize incremental growth. It is a flat long-term objective. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right, guys. I'll leave it there. Best of luck. I see you soon. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Evercore : Dan, just -- I don't want to jump the gun on '24 here, but just wanted to sort of last year EEI, you were clearly sort of -- you guys were articulating headwinds from rates and I think the '24 numbers were subsequentially brought down. How do you think about sort of '24 year again? Just qualitatively, obviously, there's headwinds from rates that keep going higher, but then you're showing a stronger load forecast prospectively. So, the puts and takes, how would you kind of articulate where '24 is shaking right now versus your expectations at the beginning of the year? Chris Womack : Let me start by saying I mean, I think we -- as I said earlier, I mean, that is the things you've mentioned, that's part of the process we're in the middle of now that will lead us to February when we give you our '24 guidance, but assessing the tailwinds that we are really excited about from economic development activities to the headwinds of interest rates. I mean that will all go into the calculus to the process of us kind of coming forth in February with our guidance for '24. But I think it's just a tab bit premature. And you've seen us in terms of how we do this. But we don't give you any kind of indication or guidance at this point in time. We'll do that in February of '24. Dan Tucker : Yes. And I guess it's just a matter of discipline for us. This is you could go back to every third quarter transcript, script ever, and you're going to hear the same answer. But I think it's fair to say where we are. Chris and I are really excited about. Our value proposition I would stack up against anybody else's right now. Durgesh Evercore : Okay. I tried it at least. Chris Womack : It was a good try. Durgesh Evercore : Just maybe then just shifting back to discussion to the CapEx upside. How much -- so obviously, billions of dollars, would you think of customer bill impacts. I guess where I'm going with this is there's a pretty sizable load growth forecast that you were suggesting mid- to high single digits what percentage of that CapEx you think would go towards or the return would be satisfied by the slowed forecast versus increasing rates, if you could talk to that a bit. Dan Tucker : Sure. Look, there's a lot of moving parts here, as you can imagine. And I don't want to get ahead of the regulatory process and things that will be evaluated in terms of the ultimate resource plan that's decided on. But stepping back at a really high level, everything that we see from a load growth perspective relative to the resources needed to serve this growing peak load, and that's key, right. You invest to make sure you can meet the peak loads, but the customers that you're adding aren't just using electricity at the peak, and it just so happens, the customers that we're adding are expected to use electricity oftentimes 24/7. And so that kind of profile will provide more than sufficient revenue at the rate structures that exist today that is needed to pay for that capital. That is where the economic benefits for other customers have the opportunity to really help with this affordability equation. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Andrew, Okay. So first, it's a quick one. Third quarter was obviously well ahead of the estimate. I know part of that is weather, but you're still pulling to the midpoint of the full year range rather than something higher. Forgive me if I missed it, but what are the offsets relative to your outlook three months ago? Dan Tucker : So, we didn't really update the year-end three months ago. Again, just as that same discipline, we only address year-end on our third quarter call. And so it's the first time we're really refining it. It's really about the first half of the year. Yes, we had a better-than-expected third quarter, but the headwinds of weather in the first half were pretty substantial. And that's why we're $0.34 below last year on a year-to-date basis. And so that's the biggest driver of kind of the middle of guidance expectations at the end of the year. Now I say all that, Andrew, I mean, again, we put out quarterly estimates all the time, and I kind of challenge you to go back and find a time where we didn't exceed that. So that should help with where our expectations are. Andrew Weisel : Yes, definitely. Okay. Got it. So you're back on track now, I guess, I could say. Next question is on Georgia, IRP. I know it's off cycle. The typical cadence would have been to wait until 2025. How receptive are the regulators to this? I assume you've had conversations with the key intervenors. Is there any reluctance to breaking that three-year pattern? And as a follow-up, is there any thought to postponing some plant retirements? I know you talked about what you're going to add and maybe sign contracts for existing assets, but any thoughts on postponing some of your retirements? Chris Womack : Let me take a shot at a couple of things. And first of all, we never get ahead of our regulators. Secondly, I'd say as we were going through the '22 IRP process, we did socialize and bring forth to the commission the activity that we saw occurring that there was a likelihood that there would need to be some update filing in between the three-year cycle. So this is not necessarily a surprise. We did mention that this would, in fact, be forthcoming. But yes, so we will go through the process, and hopefully, we'll get a decision sometime by April of '24 with this updated IRP. And what was the second part of your question? Andrew Weisel : Potential to postpone plant retirements. Chris Womack : As you look at this need that is there, that there is the likelihood that we would need some traditional units a little longer. Meaning, I think as we look at units that may have been scheduled to retire in '28, we may look to take them into the 30s. So that is a possibility as we look to respond to this growing demand for our customers. Dan Tucker : And while that's an assumption in this IRP update, I think that will be a decision to be made in a future IRP proceeding in terms of those existing coal units. Andrew Weisel : Okay. And just to clarify that you're requesting a decision in April. Does that mean the CapEx update in February will not reflect anything related to this that will wait until February of 2025 ? Dan Tucker : We'll do our best to assess where we are. There may be some degree of uncertainty, but I think we'll be able to reflect a good bit of it. Chris Womack : Yes. And the scheduling order has not been established but we expect a similar process to the traditional integrated resource planning process. And so that would align with a decision sometime in the April time frame of '24. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : For those of us out of state, I was just hoping you could provide some in-state perspective with regards to Georgia and elections and the latest and what's happening there with regards to litigation and potential for these elections. What are the next steps forward here? When could these materialize? Just any thoughts on that and any implications that could mean for Southern down the road? Chris Womack : Yes. There's a lot of activity around redistricting and lines from congressional seats. But in terms of the issue in Georgia regarding the Public Service Commission, the Rose case, that matter is still pending before the 11th Circuit quarter appeals. And there has not been a decision there. So the other matters that may go before the Georgia legislature you for redistricting. Those processes does not include matters consumed in the Rose case. So we are still waiting for a decision from the 11th Circuit on that matter. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. I mean would you expect those two elections to be held in '24 or just can't really tell too much at this point. Chris Womack : I think you answered your question. We can't really tell us this time. Jeremy Tonet : Fair enough. Fair enough. And then switching gears here, natural gas clearly a key component to the energy mix, as you talked about earlier. Just wondering, it's not as easy to build a natural gas pipeline as it was at points in the past to supply into the state. I'm just wondering where nat gas that you see incremental supply coming from? Is this MVP? Is this other sources? Or just how do you see that dynamic at this point? Chris Womack : A couple of things, I mean there are different lines and different processes that we're in the middle of in terms of trying to expand pipeline capacity. And so we are working with existing companies; one, expanding on existing infrastructure where possible, but also working to find ways to, in fact, increase pipeline capacity and pipelines themselves all across our territory. So that's all I can speak about that at this time. Yes, we know there are challenges there, but we think it is essential and important to support us being able to serve our customers with the reliability they demand and they need. And so, we are continuing to pursue various host of alternatives and options to make sure we have the supply that we need. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Fair enough. And one last one, if I could. Just be it related to Vogtle or otherwise, just wondering how could green hydrogen play into the IRP and your view? Any plans to test that out as a power plant fuel? Chris Womack : And we have. I mean we've done one of the largest blends, and we're looking at other opportunities. As you know, we participated in the hydrogen hub in the Midwest. We were not successful with the hydrogen hub that we participated in here in the Southeast, but we continue to have conversations and discussions with number of customers. And I think we're all interested in finding ways to get the price of hydrogen down and thus also create the infrastructure to move hydrogen around. So yes, I mean, we're still all arrows in the quiver, we're looking at every option for renewable resources to meet the needs of our customers and hydrogen is a big consideration for us. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : So just two things. One, a small one, Southern Power, I mean, I was kind of surprised to see the announcement about the solar project acquisitions. You have struggled to find any projects that actually makes sense from an economic perspective. Now we're in a meaningfully high interest rate environment and now you're going after these projects. So I'm just wondering if there's something specific about these two projects? Or is it just that you are managing your FFO using some of the solar benefit and on the back of the IRA? Dan Tucker : Yes. Great question, Angie, because it had been a while since we've done anything at Southern Power and really what changed was the IRA. So, we had stopped doing solar projects kind of middle of the last decade. We did a lot through 2015 through 2016 and then didn't do any sense because we didn't like the profile of investment tax credits for solar projects. The PTC is something that matches much better our regular, predictable, sustainable earnings profile and that the IRA kind of unlocked a lot of development activity on the solar front. And so the opportunity set was really big, and we narrowed it down to a couple of projects here recently that fit the kind of criteria we look for. Look, again, just to reiterate for everyone what we do at Southern Power, it's long-term contracts, it's creditworthy counterparties. It's returns that are better overall from an equity perspective than our regulated business, and it fits our overall profile. Southern Power is balance sheet financed, right? In of itself is a BBB+ company, and it's an important. If you think about the bulk of Southern Power, the rest of it, the natural gas fleet you think about what's happening with capacity needs in the Southeast, that business has become something of a crown jewel in the Southeast because it is one of the best providers of reliable, dispatchable capacity in the Southeast. So it's a business that's important to us, and these were two great opportunities to grow it. Angie Storozynski : But again, it's not again, when I think about Vogtle and the improvement in cash flow on the back of the COD of those units, you should be probably the very last or one of the very last utilities that needs to manage FFO using those PACS credits. So this is not\u2026 Dan Tucker : This is not a credit play, Angie, that 0%. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then secondly, a different note. I saw that there was another management change of Alabama Power yesterday. Again, if I'm not mistaken, that's the third one this year. Just caught my attention, if there is again, if it's just the coincidence that we've had these three management changes at Alabama Power? Or is there something more to it? Chris Womack : No, Angie, I wouldn't read anything more than that. I mean you've had a number of individual leadership there who have put 40 years of service in that have chosen to retire, and then the opportunity to bring in and bring in some new talent. I think that helps the overall team. But as you know, we pay a lot of attention to succession planning. And we do a lot of work internally in terms of growing our teams. But I think we're also wise enough to know when we can also go invest in some talent from the outside to bring in to our team and makes our overall team better. So I wouldn't read anything more to it than just the reality of a couple of individuals deciding to retire and us moving some people around. Dan Tucker : Yes. You didn't hear that 40 years and then we're back. Operator : And our last question for today is coming from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Hello, you answered almost all my questions on the capital financing and even used where I was going to use creative, but I'll throw out their nontraditional. Anything we've seen several other utilities who needed to raise financing, use some non-traditional mean divestitures, minority interest sale. Is that something in the toolbox for you? Or can we just rule that type of stuff out? Dan Tucker : Yes. Look, there's always a toolbox. I would argue our toolbox is a lot smaller than it used to be when it comes to alternative sources of capital. We did a lot of work over the last several years to kind of hone this portfolio of companies to something that really fits and that we feel really good about. So are there some small opportunities? Yes. But do we have any for sale sign sitting out there right now? No? Travis Miller : Okay, makes sense and then a quick follow-up. The dividends, what do you think the Board is looking for to get off that $0.08 or lift growth rate to 4%, 5%, 6%? What are your thoughts around that? Dan Tucker : Yes. I think it's primarily just working our way down to a sustainable payout ratio, right? So if you think about where our guidance sits here in 2023, our payout is going to be something like 77% for 2023. That's not a sustainable payout ratio for a growing company. Now that's largely a function of the ROEs we've been earning at Georgia Power during construction of Vogtle 3 and 4. As that rolls off, that payout ratio will begin to come down, but we just need to get it somewhere comfortably into something that probably starts with a six in order to start evaluating a higher growth rate. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Chris Womack : Again, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We really appreciate your interest in Southern Company. And we look forward to seeing many of you very, very soon. In the meantime, if you have questions, please give us a call. But again, thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company third quarter 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, February 15, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Malika. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent securities filings. In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn it over to Chris. Chris Womack : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 was an exceptional year for Southern Company, a year in which we proved once again that we can do extraordinary things, including delivering strong financial results in the face of unprecedented headwinds and the successful completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, the first newly constructed nuclear unit in the United States in over three decades. Since its July 30th in-service date, Unit 3's performance has exceeded our expectations, delivering over 5 million megawatt hours of safe, reliable, carbon-free energy across Georgia. Other noteworthy items for 2023 included, constructive resolution of the Vogtle 3 and 4 prudence process, resolving all issues of reasonableness, prudence and cost recovery; successfully completed construction and commissioning for a brand new 720-megawatt combined cycle plant on schedule and on time at Alabama Power's plant Barry; acquired two new solar projects at Southern Power, which once construction is complete, will add an additional 350-megawatts of carbon-free generation to its portfolio of fully contracted renewable generation; continued progress toward our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, including our interim goal of a 50% reduction versus 2007 levels by 2030; achieving a 49% reduction in 2023; earned a National Accounts Award for outstanding customer engagement by the Edison Electric Institute and top honors from J.D. Power for residential and business customer satisfaction. And just last week, Southern Company was ranked as the number one most admired electric and gas utility in Fortune magazine's World's Most Admired Companies list for 2024. These achievements reflect our team's steadfast commitment to keep the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve at the center of everything we do. Throughout 2023, our electric and gas franchises continue to excel at the fundamentals and started this year strong as evidenced through our preparations and execution during January's winter storm, Heather, when electricity demands reach all the time winter peaks and Southern Company gas system continue to reliably serving customers throughout severe weather conditions across its four-state territory. Our ability to navigate through such severe weather events further demonstrates how our customers benefit from the combination of outstanding operational performance by each of our utilities and the value of our vertically integrated state-regulated business model. Our state's long-term integrated planning processes, which include adoption of important planning assumptions like a 26% winter reserve margin for our electric utilities benefit our customers by providing a reliable and resilient mix of energy resources. Before turning the call over to Dan for a financial update, I'd like to provide an update on Vogtle Unit 4. We continue to make meaningful progress toward the completion of Unit 4 with initial criticality achieved yesterday. Initial criticality represents a key step during startup whereby operators for the first time safely begin the self-sustaining nuclear reaction to create heat for steam production. As we approach the initial sync with the grid, Unit 4 continues with the remaining start-up and preoperational testing activities that perceive the declaration of in service, which is projected in the second quarter of 2024. Our 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance range, which Dan will detail, shortly assumes Unit 4 achieves commercial operation in April. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you. Dan Tucker : Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share of $3.65 for 2023, which was the very top of our 2023 guidance range. The primary drivers of our performance compared to 2022 are higher utility revenues and lower non-fuel O&M expenses and income taxes, somewhat offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses. Mild weather was also a significant headwind with 2023 marking the mildest year in our history for our electric service territories. Our ability to deliver 2023 adjusted results at the very top of guidance is a great testament to our team and to the resilience and strength of our portfolio of companies. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared back to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to electricity sales in the economy. Weather-adjusted retail electric sales were down 0.4% for 2023 compared to 2022. Strong usage drove commercial sales growth of 1.3% for the year, which was partially offset by lower residential usage with both commercial and residential sales impacted by the return to the office dynamic. We continue to see robust residential customer growth with the addition of over 46,000 residential electric customers and nearly 27,000 residential gas customers. Since 2020, we've added over 200,000 residential electric customers, which represents the highest four-year total in decades. Industrial sales finished down for the year nearly 2%, largely due to continued slowing in housing and construction-related sectors as well as lower sales to chemical companies due to outages and long planned plant closures. Consistent with the drivers detailed in Georgia Power's recently filed 2023 Integrated Resource Plan update, economic development in our Southeast service territory remains incredibly strong. Several years of extraordinary success in attracting new and expanding businesses to our states, underpins our long-term electricity sales forecast. While electricity sales growth is projected to remain around 1% to 2% for 2024 and 2025, growth from 2025 to 2028 is projected to accelerate to an average of approximately 6% annually, with Georgia Power's total retail electric sales growth projected to be approximately 9% annually over this same period. The magnitude and velocity of this growth are significant drivers for the increased capital investments reflected in our current outlook. This projected growth also represents a tremendous opportunity to de-risk our outlook and benefit customers as a substantial projected growth in kilowatt hour sales from new manufacturing facilities and data centers has the potential to put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. Turning now to our earnings projections for 2024 and beyond. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2024 is $3.95 to $4.05, and our projected long-term adjusted EPS growth rate is 5% to 7% from that range. In early 2021, we provided the investment community with a stable post Vogtle 3 and 4 construction and EPS projection, with an initial and reasonably wide 2024 guidance range. It is perhaps the greatest of understatement to say that the world has changed a lot since early 2021. On a macro basis, we've seen significant inflation and higher and then higher for longer interest rates, which alone has translated to interest expense for 2024 hundreds of millions of dollars higher than any of us assumed three years ago. Additionally, relative to our projection in early 2021, the projected in-service date for Vogtle 4 moved into 2024 from 2023. In the face of these challenges, we've continued to work extremely hard to grow our business and to create value for investors. Compared to our projections in early 2021, our state-regulated utility rate base for 2024 is projected to be approximately $6 billion higher, while lower O&M expenses and higher sales are projected to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars more than previously projected to help maintain affordability and help pay for those investments. We estimated adjusted earnings of $0.90 per share for the first quarter of 2024. Our capital investment plan continues to be well over 95% attributable to our state-regulated utility businesses. The current five-year capital investment forecast, totaling $48 billion, reflects a $5 billion increase in state-regulated utility investments relative to our forecast a year ago. This 12% increase in capital spending reflects our ongoing efforts to further increase the resiliency of our electric and gas networks and our technology infrastructure. It also partially reflects new resources proposed in Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update, about 60% of the brick-and-mortar megawatts proposed. We have maintained our disciplined measured approach to capital forecasting for our state-regulated utility businesses. Given the magnitude of change in our projected sales growth and the timeframe in which new resources are needed to serve higher peak demands, we felt it was appropriate to go ahead and reflect certain new resources in our capital plan. Additionally, our capital investment forecast tend to grow, especially in the later years as the visibility into customer additions improves, regulatory processes unfold compliance obligations evolve and our long-term integrated system planning is refined. While the increases in this year's five-year forecast represent an outsized upward adjustment due to the scale and velocity of the projected growth in the near-term, we do believe it's reasonable to expect a historical trend of capital increases to continue going forward. On its own, our capital investment forecast of $48 billion supports annualized state-regulated rate base growth of approximately 6%, providing a solid foundation for our long-term outlook. Any upside to the capital forecast will simply serve to add durability to an already strong outlook. Strong investment-grade credit ratings remain a priority. We continue to believe that in order to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must also have high-quality credit. As we near completion of Vogtle Unit 4, the reduction in major project construction risk and the improvement in our FFO should strengthen and meaningfully improve our credit profile to help ensure we preserve what we believe will be a positively differentiated profile. We are also turning on our internal equity plans to fund the incremental capital investment at our subsidiaries that I highlighted earlier. These plans typically provide approximately $350 million of new equity annually. Additionally, we'll preserve our financing flexibility and optionality with a continuous focus on preserving and improving shareholder value. For example, we will continue to maintain an at-the-market or ATM plan to partially finance potential additional increases in capital spending in our subsidiaries or potentially, to partially refinance callable hybrid securities, if we determine doing so preserves or improves our credit and long-term EPS objectives. Southern Company strives to deliver a superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return, and we believe the plan that we've laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model the growing investments in our premier state-regulated utility franchises and the priority that we place on strong credit quality and our remarkable dividend history all contributes toward making Southern Company a premier investment. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Chris Womack : Thank you, Dan. Again, let me say, Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023. We didn't just meet challenges head on. We rose above them while remaining committed to keeping customers and communities in the center of everything that we do. I am extraordinarily proud of the hard work, the collaboration, the perseverance and the leadership that our teams show throughout the year to enable us to achieve these outstanding results. Having a team prepared to rise to such new heights doesn't just happen. For decades, Southern Company has prioritized investing in our people, with a focus on positioning our leaders and their teams to provide the exceptional service customers expect to deliver the innovative solutions needed in an evolving energy landscape and to support growing the communities we are privileged to serve. As you all know, our company implemented a leadership transition in early 2023. Rather than simply fill a handful of vacant seats, we embraced it as a grand opportunity. During 2023, we facilitated 75 officer level changes throughout the company. The changes brought renewed energy and excitement, and more importantly, and intentionally, the movement served to further strengthen what we believe to be the deepest and best bench in the industry. I am excited about the future of this company, and I'm excited about our team and its ability to deliver the results, all our stakeholders, customers and investors alike expect from Southern Company. Thank you again for joining us this afternoon and for your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first phone question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Womack : Hey, Shar, welcome. Thank you. Shar Pourreza : Hey, Chris and Dan. Good afternoon. Just quickly on the new guidance that you rolled forward. Does the new 2024 estimate range still include a Vogtle charge? So should we be adding back $0.05 or so to grow off the 5% to 7% like you've talked about in the past? And sort of that new 6% rate base growth estimate now comes with equity, I guess, what's the comfort level of hitting the midpoint of that EPS growth range, which you just reiterated? Thanks. Dan Tucker : Yes. Thanks for the question, Shahriar. And I know there's a lot of focus on this. I think we're always fascinated with the precision with which everyone wants to inhale all this down. The -- so let's start with the guidance range. Yes, I think, it absolutely includes impacts from Vogtle 4, not only being in 2024 at all, but certainly going into, as we've assumed in the guidance range, April. I mean, if you add all that up, that's $0.08 of incremental impact on 2024 relative to what it would have been if the project been lined in 2023. And -- but we haven't adjusted a range by that full amount, by any means. And what we're doing is using the flexibility, not unlike what we did in 2023 with the mildest year ever to kind of mitigate that. Those are the kind of mitigations and flexibility items that aren't necessarily available every year. You have to maintain the system, you've got to make sure you're prioritizing service to customers. And so that flexibility is limited. We're using it this year and that will diminish what we have the opportunity to do going forward. But also, I think what's not factored in is a couple of other important nuances. We thought 40 slides was enough, but maybe we needed one more slide to kind of draw how we always think about our guidance range and our growth range. We don't think about the 5% to 7% being off of the midpoint. We've always kind of drawn those trajectories off the top of it and off the bottom of it. So 7% off the top, 5% off the bottom. I think if you do that from this current range, it captures every reasonable estimate that's out there for 2025 and 2026. When it comes to the rate base growth, look, we were at 6% last year. We just added $5 billion of capital to the plan. We didn't add all the capital that we see as possible. That kind of incremental capital additions opportunity still exists. So yeah, our ability to grow rate base, and yeah, it's mitigated ever so slightly by a fraction of a percent of increased shares over time. Our ability to hit our numbers is as solid as it's ever been. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. That's helpful, Dan. And then just lastly, I know one of your peers has spoken pretty extensively on sort of nuclear PTCs, and obviously expects to receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year to fund sort of that capital plan. I guess, does the plan today -- do you expect to receive anything material on the nuclear PTC fund? Is it part of any of your credit metrics or funding plans? Thanks, Dan Tucker : Yeah. We -- yes, thanks, Shahriar. We have not factored any cash flow from nuclear PTCs into our outlook. We've got a terrific plan with an improving FFO to debt metric that's several hundred basis points above any of our threshold over time, and frankly improves every year in the forecast that I look at without those nuclear PTCs. Is there the opportunity for us to capture some of those PTCs? We think there very well could be. We're not counting on it. And to the extent we do, we'll flow those to customers to the most practical amount of time possible. And so we're -- it's not going to be a factor in kind of how our metrics or earnings look. Shar Pourreza : Terrific. Thank you, guys. Super helpful, Dan, really thank you. Dan Tucker : Yeah. You bet. Chris Womack : Thanks Shar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open now. Chris Womack : Good afternoon, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Hey, Chris, Dan. So just -- I think you've talked about targeting a 17% FFO to debt, which is differentiated. When do you expect you'll be there, let's say, in 2025, when you have first full year of bulk units running? When do you expect to be there? Dan Tucker : Yeah. So I've always kind of said we see a forecast that gets us to 17-ish, it's the way I've characterized it in the past. So let me tell you where we are, Steve, here today, and I think it's still differentiated and a terrific story and we're doing everything we can to make sure we're being conservative in the way we think about this. So if we just think about Moody's metrics, our actual result for 2023 was 14%. Keep in mind, that's before Vogtle 4 is in service. 2024, with Vogtle in service on the timeline, we believe those metrics will improve by more than 100 basis points in 2024. The weight of the incremental capital that we're deploying and the fact that some of this is kind of long live construction, you think about building new gas plants at Georgia or other things, there's a bit of regulatory lag that weighs a little bit on credit metrics. And as that resolves itself, cash flow improves. So with the forecast that I see go from 14 to over 15 in 2024, and about a 50 to 60 basis point improvement every year after that over time and that's a function of that capital, it's -- we're issuing the equity to continue the improvement. And then there's a little bit of impact in the short-term for under-recovered fuel that as that gets collected and the debt goes away, that also adds to that upward trajectory. So in my five-year forecast, we get kind of in that mid-16 towards 17 range. But again, every year in the five years is an improving story, and still hundreds of basis points above our thresholds. Steve Fleishman : Great. Thanks. And my other question, just the -- I mean the -- can you just talk to this growth, particularly, I guess, in Georgia, the 9% a year sales growth, which is at least seems unprecedented, at least for my -- go ahead, Chris. Chris Womack : No, go ahead, go ahead. Finish your question. Steve Fleishman : I guess, just how are you differentiating proposed growth projects between ones that are in your plan or ones that you're holding back from because you're not sure they're going to happen? And just -- is this a conservative risk-adjusted number, or how should I think about that? How are you doing it against your peers because it's so huge? Chris Womack : Yes, it is an unprecedented growth that we continue to witness from economic development activities. And so yeah, this is a very conservative look. I mean, we look for -- we factor in build permits, building permits in terms of actual announcements of ground has been broken. I mean, so we look at not just companies that are forward looking and making site visits, but there's been some demonstrated commitment that they will, in fact, be building a project in the state. So we go through those thresholds before, we make those filings in terms of being -- having some certainty that these projects are, in fact, real. We've just seen unprecedented economic development activity, say, for the past three years. And we continue to have an aggressive pipeline. But as we go to the commission for this updated IRP, we just factored in those companies, those businesses that has clearly demonstrated and taken actions that we think of \u2013 that shows some firmness in their participation, in their operating businesses in the state. Dan Tucker : Yeah. And I'll just add to that, that the momentum in the economic development activity has continued even since filing that 2023 IRP update. And so thank goodness, we've got a filing in 2025, and we do this periodically. It's going to continue to evolve. There's a lot still lingering out there that -- in our conservative nature, we're not counting on yet, but it's not unlikely. Chris Womack : Yeah. But Steve, this is a very conservative look as we make these decisions. Steve Fleishman : And then just one last thing on this. The 9% since everybody is very focused on data center growth, how much of it is data centers relative to manufacturing or other growth, yeah? Chris Womack : Data centers represent right now, we think somewhere around 80% of that emerging load. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Chris Womack : Thanks Steve. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open now. Carly Davenport : Hey good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Hey how are you? Thank you. Maybe just to start on the new five-year plan. Could you just talk a little bit about what drove the assumptions you made around including some of that spend on the incremental resource needs in the Georgia IRP? And then with the commission order sort of expected there in April, how would you think about updating the capital plan if it's necessary after that decision? Dan Tucker : Yes, Carly, it's a great question. So -- and I think I alluded to this a few minutes ago, it really is about the velocity and magnitude of this growth that we just kind of characterized for Steve. It's right in front of us. These resources are needed sooner than later. And so we think there's -- it was reasonable to kind of break trend for us a little bit and get slightly ahead of regulatory outcome to reflect directionally what's happening. And so just to kind of peel the curtain back a little bit, we were very specific in what we included. If you go back and look at the proposal that Georgia Power put in front of the commission back in the fall, it included a lot of various owned resources. And what we've included in the capital plan is essentially the new combustion turbines, there's three of those, and then two specific storage projects that are kind of located near military bases in -- Air Force base. That leaves hundreds, I think, over 800 megawatts of storage projects and a small storage or solar kind of not included in there. We will get a decision in April, but again, as a reminder, there's a whole another process coming in 2025. So, there may be a degree of clarity in April. There may be further clarity coming out the 2025 process. And as those play out, we'll continue to obviously keep the investment community apprised and update our projections accordingly. Carly Davenport : Great. Thank you for that. That's super helpful. And then maybe just as we think about executing on Vogtle Unit 4. Just any insights on kind of the near-term milestones that we might get updates on that we can gauge project progress there? And then to the extent that timeline does slip beyond kind of the April that's embedded into current guidance, can you talk a little bit about some of the levers that you might have to pull there to sort of offset those impacts? Chris Womack : Yes. Carly, let me start by saying with initial criticality achieved yesterday, we continue to progress through testing and start-up. The next major milestone is thinking to the grid, and that could occur later this month. We expect Unit 4 completion during the second quarter. And as we take in account the experiences we got from last year with our Unit 3, as we look at moving through Unit 4, and we could have worked through these units -- how we work through these issues that could arise. But we view this as a long-term investment and we'll make sure we're taking time to get it right. But right now, as we look at where we are, we are planning on the Unit being online in April, and we think we have a number of weeks of margin to accomplish that objective. Dan Tucker : Yes. And Carly, I'll speak to the flexibility. I mean, obviously, I mentioned earlier, we're kind of already deploying some of that flexibility to address what we expect to be us here today in April in service because beyond that, we've laid out, it's roughly $0.03 for every month, but that's partially why we have a range, right? I mean it's a $0.10 range out there. So, it could be a function of moving us within the range for the year or depending on the circumstances as the year plays out, whether it's weather or something else, we might have some greater degree of flexibility. It's just too early in the year to really be that detailed about exactly how that might play out. Carly Davenport : All right. Appreciate all that color. Thank you, both. Chris Womack : You bet, Carly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open now. Chris Womack : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon. Hey, pleasure, guys. Thanks so much for the time. Appreciate it. A couple of quick questions, following up on what you guys have said of late. Just on this big number on sales growth. Just to clarify, I mean, in your forecast, I know you've got this pending IRP that technically lines up against that sales. Are you seeing an improving ROE in the outlook? Or is this really underpinned at this point by just the IRP and the extent to which the IRP doesn't fully reflect that sales outlook? Is there something more to go as you work through the process? Question one, if you will. Dan Tucker : So I'm not sure where you're headed with improved ROE. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just from improving returns from the additional sales, if you will. Dan Tucker : Certainly, not improving returns from an overall, say, regulated utility perspective. From a -- we really view that as the opportunity to kind of put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. I mean, our objective from an ROE perspective is regular, predictable, sustainable, I think you'll continue to see it play out that way. Just to be clear, Julien, on the sales growth that we've laid out here, so this is roughly 6% in the long term for Southern that 9% number for Georgia Power, this is actually based on a more conservative view than what's in the IRP update because the IRP update had to put some degree of expectation for additional success from an economic development perspective so that we do stay ahead of this from a resource perspective. It's not a huge differential, but what it also kind of reinforces is as this continues to play out, those numbers have the potential to continue to go up. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. Excellent. And then just pivoting back to the FFO to debt quickly, I mean, the 17% that you guys were talking about once, I mean, what is -- has that changed at all? Just in terms of how you're thinking about pro forma Vogtle 4 coming on? Dan Tucker : No, nothing's changed in terms of what I believe the financial profile supports which, again, my objectives, I've said this before, I think our parent company being a BBB+, kind of the A category for all the utilities, I think the profile we see ahead of us fully supports that. The only thing that's changed is a slightly slower ramp-up in those metrics because of the incremental capital that we're deploying. But in terms of where we stand relative to any of our thresholds, it's several hundred basis points above any of those in every year, and every year improves. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. And then just quickly on the reactor cooler pumps, I know there was a little bit of talk in the K here. What's sort of the status on V4? And then just to the extent to which that there is some root cause impact on some of the other -- there's a need to evaluate the adjacent reactor cooler pumps, if you will. I know there's some language in the K on this. Chris Womack : Yes. And so yes, we've done all the analysis, we sent the pump back to the manufacturer. And we think we identified the cause of the issue, but a root cause analysis has not been performed yet. But we have tested all the other pumps. And with the new pump, we made sure there were not any similar issues, but we think we're in pretty good shape with the pumps as we go forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. So stay tuned on that front. Thank you guys very much. I really appreciate it. Chris Womack : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Chris Womack : Hi, Nick. Nick Campanella : Hey, good morning or good afternoon. I am sorry. Chris Womack : Good afternoon. Nick Campanella : I guess just a follow-up on the question that Julien had on the root cause. I think you just mentioned the possibility of having to go look back at Unit 3 pumps in the Vogtle. And just what's the actual risk \u2013 line? And when is that no longer going to be an issue? Chris Womack : I guess, as we have looked at the pump that we sent to the manufacturers, as we identified what we thought the issue was, we think it's not an issue with the other pumps. I mean, we test the other pumps. We assess the pump, the new pump that we installed. And we think we just have a good handle. And on these pumps, I think you consider the run time. I think that provides good color to kind of, I guess, the confidence we have in the pump and what we've identified as the issues and things we have to do to make sure we don't have similar issues as we go forward. Dan Tucker : Yes. I think globally, there's 24 of these things running like a champ right now. Nick Campanella : Absolutely. Yes, that's helpful. And then just on the capital plan, and reflecting roughly 60% of the IRP, I know that you kind of get a decision in the first half of this year. So just how do we kind of think about tweaks to the financing plan? Is it just going to be another fourth quarter update this time next year? Or is there a mid-period opportunity in the cards? Dan Tucker : Look, none of these regulatory outcomes will be -- they'll all be in the light of day. I think it will be clear what's approved and what's yet to be approved. I kind of laid out what we've included already, which is those combustion turbines and two very specific storage projects. And so I think we'll be able to provide color along the way. We'll certainly do more formal updates every year as we normally do, but I think there'll be interim opportunities. And the other interim opportunity that will continue to exist is we've remained extremely conservative when it comes to owning in renewables in any of our electric service territories. We also are very optimistic that, that will happen. And as that gets clarity, we'll make sure that, that's known as well. Chris Womack : But you'll also see great transparency through this process, man, as the commission and Georgia works through the process, many staff is filing testimony today, and they may have a different perspective. But you'll see that process play out and that leads us to the decision in April by the commission. But you've seen these IRP processes before. So those processes will continue as we go forward, and you'll see real time kind of how it unfolds. Nick Campanella : All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open now. Chris Womack : Hey, David. David Arcaro : Thanks so much. Hey, thank you. Let's see. Thinking about that load growth trajectory, is 6% rate base growth still the right kind of parameter to think about longer term? 6% load growth, 6% rate base growth, is that enough to kind of handle the system strain, the generation need to strain on the T&D system over time? Or is there potential upward growth rate pressure on that rate base growth number as you get into later years of this decade? Dan Tucker : Yes. Look, I think, Dave, what we've tried to imply is there certainly is upward potential here. We've remained incredibly conservative and measured in how we forecasted. We're not trying to get too far ahead of any regulatory processes. We'll get these decisions in April. We'll have a 2025 process. We believe there's more economic development activity that is likely to come to fruition. And so given all of that, it is certainly not unreasonable that our capital budget will continue to rise to serve that incremental load. And so there certainly could be upward using your words, pressure on that rate base. David Arcaro : Got it. That makes sense. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about the rate impacts, coming from that load growth? Are these low-priced new commercial customers when you're thinking about data center and manufacturing customers, such that there is a lot of grid investment that has to be covered by others within the system or other opportunities here? It sounded like you kind of see the opposite where you're bringing in a lot of revenue that ends up being downward pressure on the rest of the system. So I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how you see rates progressing over time? Dan Tucker : Yes. No, go ahead, Chris. Chris Womack : No, we do expect to see rate decreases for our customers with these additional sales and the customer growth that we'll experience. We think that should more than offset the cost of the resources needed to serve. And so we -- affordability is something we pay a lot of attention to, and there are things we do internal. And we think that one of the benefits of this sales growth is having the opportunity to put downward pressure on rates for our customers across the board. And so that's kind of how we see it and how we evaluate each project. I want to make sure that is, in fact, putting downward pressure on rates. Dan Tucker : If you think about where probably every utility company was a year ago, one of the greatest risks facing all of this was affordability. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to derisk our outlook. David Arcaro : Excellent. Thanks for that. Really helpful. Appreciate it. Chris Womack : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Womack : Hey, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good afternoon. Chris Womack : Good afternoon. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to come in, I guess, on the debt funding side, if I could start. I understand the Georgia Power debt funding increase driven by the IRP there. But at the holdco, just wondering what's the main contributor to the kind of big step up there of expected debt issuance? It looks like several billion in the 2024 plan now, and I think it was much less than that before. So just kind of curious, I guess, on the holdco debt issuance step-up expectations. Dan Tucker : Yes. So in terms of the change kind of planned versus plan, Jeremy, it's largely driven by the CapEx as well, right? I mean, ultimately, the parent company is funding Georgia Power's equity contribution. And while we're financing that partially with new equity through our plans, certainly -- it's certainly not all being funded directly with new shares. So there's incremental debt there. And then just the overall magnitude of the parent company issuances is largely driven by maturities. If you look a couple of pages beyond, there's, I think, over $5 billion worth of maturities in the same time period. So the amount that's kind of new money is much smaller. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thanks for that. And just curious if you're able to share any thoughts on the Georgia PSC elections here. Just as far as from what you guys see inside the state for those pending elections. Do you expect the ballot in the elections to happen before the November general election? Or do you think it all kind of comes in November? Just kind of curious, I guess, how you think timing could shape up there? Chris Womack : I have no idea. I mean that matter is still in the court system. And so we'll observe it, just like you are. But I have no insight into how that's going to play out at this time. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. And just a quick last one, if I could. If you guys are running an RFP process in the Georgia IRP, and how you think Southern Power -- Georgia Power stacks up, I guess, in RFP process there? Dan Tucker : Look, just in answering that, generally, Jeremy, I mean, and we've said this before, the IRA is going to position all of our electric utilities to be much more competitive in these self-build options when it comes to resources, whether or not it plays out in this particular RFP, or it's a subsequent RFP, or it's a customer-specific siding, those things will happen over time. But it's also likely a function of something later in the plan. So not a 2024, 2025, maybe not even 2026 kind of resource. We're talking really towards the back end of the plan where that becomes a real opportunity. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Chris Womack : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open now. Chris Womack : Hey, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good afternoon team. Just -- is there a way for us to give us a range? And I understand if you can't. But just in terms of the current capital plan, was that the Georgia IRP? What I'm after is what looks like a successful outcome there as we await the April decision? Just trying to see what is baked into the plan and what to look for in that April decision? Dan Tucker : Yeah. It's a fair question, Durgesh. But this is where I want to stop short of getting ahead of any regulatory processes here. We've, kind of, characterized in terms of the megawatts that we've included that it's roughly 60% of the brick-and-mortar megawatts that were proposed. And so the best way for me to characterize it without getting ahead of anything is just say that the incremental capital associated with what we didn't include won't be lost in the rounding. It's a pretty meaningful number. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. I appreciate that, Dan. And then as we think about just along those lines, incremental CapEx upside. Is there a rule of thumbs, again, just for our models, high level, how should we think about it getting financed? You've got some strong load growth. But when we're thinking about higher CapEx, what percentage could be equity finance versus debt? Any guidance there? Dan Tucker : Yeah. I think what we've done with this update is pretty representative of how we think about additional opportunities. So we added $5 billion of capital of this plan, let's call that $1 billion a year on average. We've added roughly $350 million of equity every year. So that 35% to 40% range is representative of our consolidated equity ratio and represents pretty well what we think is necessary to maintain if not marginally improve, but really just maintain the credit profile that's already in a really good place. Durgesh Chopra : Very clear. Thank you so much. Appreciate the time guys. Chris Womack : Thanks, Durgesh. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Chris Womack : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hi. Good afternoon. A couple of quick follow-up questions, really. One, just to clarify, the equity of $350 million per year. That's through 2026 in the slides. It kind of sounds like you're saying that's through 2028. Should we think of that as just a run rate of $350 million per year going forward and potentially more if there's more CapEx? Dan Tucker : Yes. So, what that $350 million represents is us turning on what we refer to as our internal plan. So, it's issuing new shares through our DRIP, through our 401(k), and that's about the run rate. And it just happens to match up pretty well with the needs associated with the $5 billion of incremental capital. We typically also maintain an at the market plan as flexibility. And so to the extent there's incremental CapEx that emerges, which again, is certainly reasonably possible given everything we've described, the ATM's the source that we'll tap into to help finance that. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Very good. Next, on the CapEx update. Just to clarify, and sorry if I missed it. Does that include anything for Alabama Solar? Or would that be incremental? Dan Tucker : Yes. No, that would be incremental. There's still no new rate-based solar included. So, we've remained conservative in terms of our projections there in the outlook. And hey, just going back, Andrew, real quickly to the equity question. Just to kind of point out since maybe it wasn't clear because we only put a three-year financing plan out there, yes, leaving the plans on every year. And on average, kind of the average increase to shares every year is a fraction of a percent. So, that's also kind of in the rounding. Andrew Weisel : Sounds good. One last one, if I may. Dividend growth, you've been very consistent at $0.08 per share, about 3%. Given the CapEx outlook, is there any point in time at which you might reconsider the trajectory? Dan Tucker : Another terrific question. So, we had kind of alluded to the possibility of reevaluating the rate of dividend growth once we got Vogtle 4 into service, and kind of had -- we're kind of in a steady state and into the kind of below 70% somewhere. Given our current circumstances where were we are, in a place of issuing equity, perhaps one of the most efficient sources of equity is to remain modest in the way we continue to increase the dividend. So, I think for the foreseeable future, the trajectory we've been on is a reasonable expectation for the trajectory we'll remain on. Andrew Weisel : Very clear. Thank you so much. Dan Tucker : You bet. Chris Womack : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead, your line is open. Anthony Crowdell : Hey good morning Chris, good morning Dan. If I could just pitch up one quick one on the data centers and I guess, the load growth. It seems like we finally are going to get some load growth in this sector, and we're all looking at data centers has helped. But it seems that maybe the rate design question, we're all trying to figure out typically a lower-margin customer, large investment requirement. And earlier, you touched on maybe helping with some customer bills. I just -- my question is, if you go deeper into that on -- is it going to be bigger bill impact and bigger fights and rate design or you don't think that's an issue? Chris Womack : I mean there's always -- there will always be issues. But I think as we look at increased sales, as we look at growth in customers, and then as we work with these new customers, we think this provides us the opportunity to have downward pressure on rates. And so we will work with these customers in terms of their pricing. But once again, I just go back to the fundamentals of increased sales opportunity and this customer growth, how that supports the opportunity for us to put downward pressure all across our customer base to see downward pressure on rates. I mean, we'll evaluate each customer to ensure that, in fact, does happen, that they put downward pressure on overall rates across the company. Dan Tucker : Yeah. And Anthony, what it appears a lot of these data centers are beginning to do is prioritize reliable, resilient service over many other things. That gives us the opportunity to price it appropriately for the benefit of everyone else. Chris Womack : And, yeah, we'll look at the size, the demand, the timing, there are other factors that will go into making sure that we price service appropriately to those customers. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Chris Womack : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead. Your line is open now. Chris Womack : Hi, Angie. Agnieszka Storozynski : Good morning. Great. I guess -- I know that everybody is asking questions on data centers, but I'm just -- just again, maybe just taking a step back. So when somebody wants to locate a data center in your service territory, do they just get connected to the grid? Or do they develop their own power sources? Do you actually see that they, for instance, have some preference for non-emitting resources. Do they use you more as a backup power source. Again, just -- just, again, trying to understand the dynamics of those data centers being added to in Georgia. Chris Womack : Angie, there are a lot of considerations that go into that decision. And yeah, we want to connect them to our grid. And yeah, we'll have conversations with them about renewable resources and the mix. But those are conversations that we do have with them, recognizing what upgrade may be made on the system, locations, where they are. So there are a lot of kind of really detailed conversations, engineering conversations that go into making those final decisions that also then ultimately impact the pricing for that service. Agnieszka Storozynski : But again, it's not self-supply, right? So they use Georgia Power, for example, as a first source of power. Chris Womack : Absolutely. Yes, that's correct. Agnieszka Storozynski : Okay. And then secondly, again, I know this question has been asked over and over. Just hard to believe that the load growth is not having a bigger impact on your earnings growth? And again, I don't even imagine this is like an emerging markets sort of pace of load growth, especially for Georgia and those outer years, and yet there's no impact from -- again, from our vantage point on your earnings growth. Is it just because the interest expense drag is so pronounced that it absorbs the help that you're getting from higher load growth? Dan Tucker : Yes, Angie, it's a few things. Certainly, relative to where we were a year ago, and I think we've said this before, in a higher for longer environment, certainly, interest is a bigger headwind going forward. But the bigger dynamic in your question is around what we're actually investing in to serve this load or why we're investing. So keep in mind, the 6% for Southern Company sales growth and 9% for Georgia Power, that's kilowatt hour usage. That's the growth in the total kilowatt hours used. What we invest to do is serve the peaks. And so that looks a little different than the 24/7. We've got a lot of resources. We just may have to incrementally add resources to serve the peaks, and that's what you're seeing largely in the capital deployment. And net-net, we're comfortably in that 5% to 7% growth range. Agnieszka Storozynski : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Chris Womack : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Womack : How are you doing, Paul? Paul Fremont : Great. Congratulations on the good quarter. Chris Womack : Thank you very much. Paul Fremont : Just to clarify, if you were not to get sort of the higher growth rate in sales after 2025, would that have an impact or change -- potentially change your 5% to 7% growth target? Dan Tucker : No. Paul Fremont : Okay. Great. And then I noticed that the gas capital spending is roughly unchanged. Can you sort of share with us what you're anticipating is going to happen in Illinois? And is there spending that's being shifted from Nicor to any of the other gas subsidiary? Chris Womack : And yes, I think you got it just right. I mean, we see the opportunities to have some increased capital spending in Atlanta around the operations here in Georgia. So we think that allows that gas investments to be stable going forward. So I think you've spoken to it just right. Dan Tucker : Yes. And any changes in Illinois are modest, to be fair. I mean -- and the outcome there for us, while disappointing, also provided a bit of a road map as to how to be successful going forward in navigating that jurisdiction in terms of just the things we've got to make sure we do as we deploy capital. And keep in mind, a huge, vast majority of the capital that's deployed for Nicor Gas is compliance related. And so there's only so much to kind of not do in the first place. Paul Fremont : Great. And then my last question. I mean, generally speaking, when we think of EPS growth, with respect to rate base growth, there tends to be dilution to the rate base to the level of rate base growth because a portion or the equity portion is funded either by parent debt or by parent equity. So can you help us sort of understand at 6% rate base growth, is it possible for you to achieve? Or how would you achieve sort of the high end of your growth target? Dan Tucker : Yes. Great question, Paul. So again, we were at 6% growth last year in rate base. We've added $5 billion of incremental capital to that. It's -- we kind of characterize it as approximately 6, but then also the shares we're issuing, and I think I mentioned this earlier, was that equates to a fraction of a percentage and it's kind of just in the rounding. We feel very comfortable that net-net, how all these things stack up is a conservative achievable forecast. Paul Fremont : Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much. Chris Womack : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Travis Miller : Hello, everyone. Thank you. Chris Womack : Thanks Travis. Dan Tucker : Thanks Travis. Travis Miller : You've answered almost all of my questions. I do want to follow-up on that dividend, it was one of my questions. Just to clarify what you said, you would expect the dividend growth to stay below earnings growth for at least a couple of more years. Did I hear that correctly? Dan Tucker : Yes. Yes, Travis. You did. And so again, our cadence of growth has been $0.08 per year for several years. I think it's reasonable to expect that to continue, of course, it's all subject to the Board's oversight and approval. But what that will do is take us during this high period of CapEx, which hopefully goes on for a very long period of time, brings us comfortably down into the 60s from a payout ratio perspective. And so that's a good place to be, and we'll evaluate it every year with what the forecast looks like and what's appropriate. Right now, I think the reasonable expectation is that continued modest growth, which is just below 3%. Travis Miller : Yes. Okay, very good. And then obviously, a lot of talk about the demand growth. Put another way, what does demand growth mean for operating cost growth? Is there a tight correlation there if you get 6% or whatever percent annual demand growth? Should we also see a similar increase in operating costs? Or is there not a link there? Dan Tucker : Yes. There's certainly a relationship, I wouldn't call it a correlation, but to the extent we're building a new gas plant, certainly, that comes along with incremental O&M to the extent we're building new transmission distribution lines, there's some maintenance component to that. But that's also part of the cost structure that we're ensuring these new rates and revenues will cover such that the net result is the opportunity to put downward pressure on the existing rates. Travis Miller : Okay. Got it. Thanks so much. That's all I had. Chris Womack : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ryan Levine : Hi, everybody. Chris Womack : How are you doing? Ryan Levine : Good. How are you? With Vogtle's COD targeted for April freeing up some management attention and the personnel changes that were highlighted, do you see any meaningful opportunities to reduce O&M spending below the current guidance as time progresses? Or are these initiatives tabled, given all the opportunity in Georgia by the IRP process? Chris Womack : No. I mean, we're always looking across our hand and finding ways to be more efficient. I mean, so there's ongoing efforts to -- once again, as we look at affordability, I mean, we think about the opportunities to keep -- to drive rates from pricing down because of sales growth and because of customer growth, but also making sure that we're focused on looking internal in terms of being more efficient and finding ways to also drive down the cost of our O&M expenses. Also making sure, we take full advantage of fuel pricing. I mean, you see where natural gas prices are now. So looking across the entire portfolio, I mean, that is an ongoing continuous exercise that we'll always focus on in terms of finding ways to drive down O&M and find ways to be more efficient. Dan Tucker : Yes. And just as a nuance, all the costs associated with completing Vogtle 3 and 4 is a capital cost. And so those aren't O&M costs that are an opportunity to reduce. Chris Womack : Yes. And the last thing I'd add, even though we've had this focus on Vogtle, but it hasn't kept us from paying attention to the fundamentals, to making sure that we provide the service that customers expect, but also being focused on the cost of our product. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then what's the peak hour load growth forecast in Georgia? And how much lower is that than the total kilowatt hour growth number that you cited? And as you're looking to execute on this plan, how -- are there any limitations with supply chains that could constrain growth opportunities via the IRP process? Dan Tucker : Yeah. Look, on supply chain, I think we're in terrific shape, given our scale and just -- we've kind of seen this coming for a little while to the point where we can deploy the resources needed. On your peak question, we'll have to follow-up with you on that, Ryan. Just let's connect with the Investor Relations team and get you an answer then. Ryan Levine : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Dan Tucker : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Womack : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson : Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on this these opportunities that you guys have. Just with respect to the data center stuff, I mean, a; you did indicate in your prepared remarks, it seemed that this was based on actual activity, physical construction activity, et cetera. Is it correct to assume that these guys -- these data centers, et cetera, have a price in mind? I mean, they wouldn't be doing this. I mean, obviously, they're using a large amount of electricity. It's part of the economics of their determination to move that this -- that they know how much they're going to be essentially paying for power if they're doing this, correct? Chris Womack : I think there is -- yes, I mean, they may not know exactly what the price will be. But once again, as we sit with them, understanding their needs, what their desires are and the level of service, I mean that all goes into consideration of what the ultimate price will be. I mean, the value, location, reliability, resiliency, all of those things go into consideration as we kind of price these projects out. And so that's a part of the negotiation, that's part of the conversation that we have with it. Paul Patterson : Okay. In some jurisdictions, because they have their own backup power, because they have to be there in case there is an outage or something, they have to get approval from regulatory commissions, their respective state regulatory commissions. Is that the case in Georgia? Chris Womack : No. I mean, like I said, I mean, we will -- I mean\u2026 Dan Tucker : Yeah, there's some customer-sided programs that have been proposed in the IRP, Paul, that those are being evaluated and those serve the same purpose, but it's not the dynamic that you're describing in those other states. Paul Patterson : Okay. Then just roughly speaking, when we're talking about the average data center rate versus the system rate, is there a rule of thumb as to where that kind of is? Do you follow what I'm saying? In other words, I mean how much of a percentage of the average system rate for Georgia Power, let's say, with a data center customer be roughly, I mean, just roughly speaking, you're getting? Chris Womack : I don't think so. I think we may be better informed as we bring some more projects online. Right now, I think -- I don't think that would be the case. And plus it could be trade secrets as well, so. Paul Patterson : Okay. Then just finally, when we're looking at 2026, 2027 and 2028 in that 9% number, for instance, for Georgia Power, does that go up a lot? In other words, is it kind of -- I mean, is 2026 -- is 2028 a lot higher than 2026, if you follow what I'm saying? In other words, it's a three-year period, the number jumps up a lot in that period? Do you follow what I'm saying? In other words, is it roughly the \u2013ratable over that period of time? Or is this sort of a hockey stick in terms of what you see in terms of demand? Dan Tucker : Yes. It's fairly ratable, Paul. It's obviously not perfectly linear by any means. But that -- the significant load really begins to come in, in, say, late 2025 and into 2026, which is why a lot of the resource proposals you see at Georgia Power are to really serve the 2026-2027 winter peak to make sure they're in place for that, and then it continues to grow from there. Paul Patterson : Thanks so much and congratulations. Chris Womack : Thank you. Dan Tucker : Thanks Paul. Operator : Thank you. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Chris Womack : Again, let me say, Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023. And I am really excited about the future of this company. Let me thank everybody for joining us today, and wish everybody a happy day, and thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you Rob. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.  Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings.  In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack. Christopher Womack : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for what is such an exciting time for our company. Monday, we announced that Plant Vogtle Unit 4 successfully achieved commercial operation. Units 3 and 4 now deliver more than 2,200 megawatts of reliable 24/7 carbon-free energy and are designed to do so for decades to come. With all 4 units operational, the Vogtle site is now the largest generator of clean energy in the country. I cannot be prouder of our team's press severance and commitment to getting Vogtle Units 3 and 4 completed with the standard of quality clearly demonstrated by Unit 3's performance since it reached in service last July. Along with our own team, success on this historic project required the hard work and dedication of tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers, a committed group of co-owners and regulators who had the courage to support new nuclear when others did not.  While it was not our mission when we embarked on this project and while it was at times an arduous journey. We have proven that new nuclear is achievable in the United States. With ever-increasing demands for carbon-free energy and the burgeoning demand for reliable 24/7 Energy to support our digital economy and society, we believe our country will need more nuclear energy. So the importance of this project for Georgia and our nation cannot be understated. This is what making history looks like. These are the first new nuclear units built from the ground up here in the United States in over 30 years. And we are proud to be the company that saw it through.  Dan I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Daniel Tucker : Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of 2024, our adjusted EPS was $1.03 per share $0.24 higher than the first quarter of 2023 and $0.13 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were investments in our state-regulated utilities and weather that was less mild for our electric utilities than in the first quarter of 2023.  This is somewhat offset by higher interest expense and depreciation. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. All our businesses experienced a strong start for 2024, driving our results meaningfully higher than our estimate of $0.90 per share.  While there were several factors for this performance versus our estimate, one worth highlighting is the higher than expected weather-adjusted electricity sales in our commercial customer class. This was driven by a combination of our strong local economies as well as increased usage by many of our existing data center customers. Sales to data centers were up over 12% for the quarter compared to last year.  Overall, weather-normal retail electric sales to all classes were 1.7% higher than the first quarter of 2023. Industrial sales are beginning to show signs of recovery following a soft 2023 with year-to-date increases led by the lumber and paper industries. The Southeast regional labor supply remains above pre-pandemic levels. Employment growth is strong and unemployment is low, averaging approximately 3% across our regulated electric jurisdictions. A favorable business climate and increased expansion of manufacturing is attracting new households to the Southeast, driving continued net in-migration and customer growth.  Before turning the call back over to Chris, I'd like to highlight our most recent dividend increase. Last week, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our annual common dividend raising the annualized rate to $2.88 per share. This action marks the 23rd consecutive increase, and this will now be 77 consecutive years dating all the way back to 1948, that Southern Company has paid a dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous year.  This remarkable track record remains an important part of Southern Company's value proposition. In one quick note, our adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter is $0.90 per share.  Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you. Christopher Womack : Thank you Dan. Our system performed extremely well, and that's a testament to our team's collective commitment to serving customers reliably across our business, especially as we meet the demands of the extraordinary growth that we're seeing. Particularly within our Southeast footprint, we continue to see strong economic development activity with first quarter investment announcements representing the second highest first quarter on record as our teams continue to work closely with our states and local development authorities to attract new businesses.  This growth continues to reflect a diverse mix of sectors with recent announcements, including automotive suppliers, flooring and glass manufacturers, data centers and mixed-use developments. During our year-end earnings call in February, we updated our forecast to reflect projected retail electric sales growth that is accelerating to a projected growth rate of approximately 6% from 2025 to 2028. The underlying Georgia Power projected sales growth rate is approximately 9% over the same period. As we look ahead, we're encouraged to see the signs of incremental growth also materializing in Alabama and Mississippi.  A little more in 2 weeks ago, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the Public Service Commission staff and multiple interveners in the 2023 IRP update docket. This approval affirms the need to quickly procure and deploy several thousand megawatts of resources to serve customers rapidly growing project electricity demands by the winter of 2026 and 2027.  Georgia Power was also authorized to build and own a balanced collection of resources, including new natural gas combustion turbines and battery energy storage systems while also providing for an accelerated RFP process for incremental battery energy storage systems. The constructiveness and timeliness of decisions like this are a testament to the quality of our Southeastern states regulatory environment and our ability to meet the projected rapid demand growth garnering headlines across the country.  Coinciding with Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update filing last fall, and the release of our sales forecast in February, external attention including from the investment community has focused on several key questions. How do you know the load in your forecast is real? How do you know you're pricing this new load appropriately? And what protections are in place if the forecasted load does not materialize? Those are all very important questions, and the answers are all fundamentals of how Southern Company has run our electric utilities for a very, very, very long time. We'll address each one of those questions in just a moment. First, I want to share with you what we believe are the 4 key characteristics required to successfully navigate this tremendous growth opportunity. We believe Southern Company is positioned as well or better than any utility company in the country on these four fronts. First, it requires supportive states and constructive regulation. Our states continue to be great economic development partners, and they have advanced economic policies that support healthy growth.  When it comes to utility regulation, our states are among the best in the country at balancing the needs of customers while helping ensure utilities provide real value to customers in the form of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy.  Second, it requires institutional wherewithal. We have vast expertise and experience deploying energy infrastructure. We've been investing billions to improve the resilience of our electric and gas transmission and distribution networks. In recent years across our subsidiaries and across the country, we've built thousands of megawatts of energy supply in the form of new solar, wind and battery facilities, advanced micro grids, a state-of-the-art combined cycle natural gas plant and the only new nuclear units built in this country and more than a generation.  These new assets along with the existing electric and gas infrastructure we operate have served customers with a superior measure of reliability and resilience. We have the people, we have the experience and we have the scale to be successful. The third requirement is a flexible pricing framework. Our electric utilities working with existing customers approved by their respective public service commissions have a history of being able to price new large load projects appropriately even in periods of high demand and challenging market conditions.  These frameworks are designed to benefit all customers. For example, Georgia Power's real-time pricing rate or RTP, which was pioneered decades ago allows for the flexibility to price individual customers based on their unique low profile and risk characteristics.  And finally, success in this environment requires experience and discipline, experience understanding utility economics and the true marginal cost to serve new customers. Experience identifying and mitigating the risk inherent and new or expanding large load customers, and experience and competing for new load with an objective of capturing tangible economic benefit for customers and states.  Our experience, combined with the robust models and tools we employ are partially a product of the competitive economic environment we've navigated in the Southeast for decades. For example, in Georgia, most new large load customers can choose their electricity supplier.  Over the years, we've been the chosen provider more often than not, however, it's a load we did not win or perhaps did not even choose to compete for that reflects our discipline and experience. By offering prices designed to recover the marginal cost to serve new loads, we seek to protect all other customers and importantly, maintain our credibility with our regulators and state policymakers. I'll now turn back to Dan to address those 3 key stakeholder questions pertaining to this extraordinary growth opportunity. Daniel Tucker : Chris. So how do we know the load in our forecast is real? The short answer is that we've already incorporated risk adjustments to the forecast. One could argue it's a conservative view. We would say our forecasts are informed by our experience and by our continuous engagement with prospective new and existing customers. We've included a visual representation of our process in the slide deck. Typically, our forecast appropriately represents only a portion of the full potential load we might ultimately serve. If a customer has not formally communicated state-specific project details with our company, they're not included in the forecast. If they have a choice of utility provider within the state that they have chosen, which is the case in each of our states, they are either not included or only included at a reduced probability weighted level.  Importantly, even once a customer has committed to one of our utilities, we further risk adjust the forecast based on the likelihood of delays on the customer side, whether those are construction delays or delays in ramping up production. And lastly, we further risk adjust the forecast based on the history of announced loads being higher than actual customer loads. Lower actual customer loads often result from technology improvements, economic conditions or other factors. All of that to say, we believe our forecast is the best representation of expected future demand. And with the potential for additional new customers to choose our states and utilities, there is potential for our forecast to be higher down the road.  Next, I'll discuss pricing. When it comes to knowing that we're pricing this load appropriately with a view towards protecting existing customers, several of the factors Chris mentioned a moment ago are key. We use our experience and robust tools to ascertain the expected marginal cost to serve each new customer and incorporate that into our flexible pricing mechanisms.  We priced the load in a manner that helps ensure the marginal cost will be borne by the new customer. Sometimes, as is the case with Georgia Power's recent growth, we're able to provide new large load customers with competitive market pricing that also provides meaningful benefits back to existing customers. These benefits are not only driven by carefully constructed market pricing. They're also a the function of a robust, long-term integrated resource planning process and Georgia Power's ability to use existing resources to serve a large portion of the new demand while only needing to incrementally invest to meet higher peak demands.  The stipulation the Georgia PSC recently approved includes a commitment by Georgia Power for these customer benefits to be incorporated into the 2025 rate case. Our approach to pricing has never been more important given the current macroeconomic backdrop. Affordability is a key tenet of our customer-centric business model, and we work hard to ensure new customer demands don't place additional burdens on those less able to afford it.  Lastly, the risk question, what protections are in place for our forecasted load does not materialize? I've already described how we've risk adjusted the forecast itself, the other major risk mitigations pertain to local infrastructure improvements and our portfolio of supply resources. These new large load customers often require significant local distribution system improvements, and these improvements often provide limited incremental benefit to other customers. As a result, we require most new large load customers to pay for these improvements upfront, helping ensure other customers are protected.  When it comes to supply resources, the risk mitigation comes in the form of the diversity of our resources. Purchased resources or PPAs, can expire without being renewed. Older owned resources which might require additional investments or higher maintenance O&M spend to remain available over the long term can be retired earlier. Decisions and risk strategies like these are a key aspect of the multiyear integrated resource planning processes in each of our states. With robust long-term planning comes optionality in future decision-making. Said differently, planning for 20 years of resource needs every 3 years helps ensure that customers benefit from a flexible resource plan that is equally focused on reliability and affordability.  Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you to wrap up our prepared remarks. Christopher Womack : Before taking your questions this afternoon, I'd like to first take a moment to reinforce that as we serve these growing energy needs, we also remain focused on achieving our long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals, including net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Working closely with each of our states, and with an unrelenting focus on safely and reliably serving our customers' needs, we continue to make responsible economic resource decisions over the long term. For example, over 80% of the resources additions plan across our system totaling nearly 10,000 megawatts from 2023 to 2030 are 0 carbon emitting resources.  We have accomplished some wonderful things in recent weeks, and we are even more excited about our future. We have seven quality state-regulated utilities with long track records of outstanding operational and financial performance that deliver over 90% of our earnings, along with a few quality complementary businesses, we believe we have the ideal portfolio to support our long-term objectives.  Southern Company's value proposition has never been more attractive. Our team has never been stronger, and we are positioned as well as we ever have been. As I said earlier, we have the people, the experience and the scale for sustained long-term success. Thank you, as always, for your interest in Southern Company.  Robert, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : At this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Good to see the strong sales growth coming in during the quarter. I guess just as we think about the impact to earnings from some of these volumes, are there any sensitivities that you can provide around the commercial load or the data center load specifically there? Daniel Tucker : Yes, absolutely. So just big as a bread box. So it's roughly -- if you think about our total sales, kind of the average price, you're talking about $40 million for a 1% change in our overall sales. Now for the vast majority of what's showing up here, whether it's data centers, some of these other large load industrial customers, it may skew slightly below that. So really it's somewhere in the range of $20 million to $40 million for 1% change in sales. Carly Davenport : Got it. That's super helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, as you think about the recent commission approvals on the 23 Georgia IRP filing, do you see any incremental capital needed relative to what you previously laid out on the fourth quarter call? Daniel Tucker : So there will be some additions based on the approval, Carly, and that largely pertains to the additional storage resources, the battery energy storage system. So if you recall what we included was two very specific projects in our outlook, but the commission actually approved 500 megawatts of owned storage, which is a little more than double what we had assumed.  And so total dollars is going to -- I'm going to give you a big range. And I'm going to throw in here if you didn't see, we also announced an expansion of one of our solar projects in Southern Power. So that also was not included in our forecast back in February. So all told you're somewhere above $500 million, a little south of $1 billion, probably and what we'll do, we don't want to get too far ahead of the regulatory processes. There's specific certification processes to go through. So we'll let all that play out and then update our forecast more formally later on. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Well, first, congrats on getting Vogtle up and running. That's great. And just -- I know on the last call, you talked to the better sales growth, and you raised the CapEx and now there's a little bit more potential to come, and that kind of your reaffirmed squarely in the 5% to 7%. And I know you're a big company, and obviously, it's a lot to move the needle of 5% to 7%. But just is it fair to say that as you are adding this capital that at least within this range of 5% to 7% or some benefits of adding the capital even net of financing? Daniel Tucker : Yes. Look, I think it's fair to characterize that everything that is occurring and particularly if the momentum continues and what we're seeing, I would characterize that as adding an upward bias to where we are from an earnings perspective. And you kind of said it, Steve, and we certainly saw your commentary and your note yesterday. We are a big company. We are issuing equity. But even with all of that, these incremental investments should have an accretive effect. But I think it's just too soon to say exactly what that means, but an upward bias, absolutely exists, particularly if this momentum continues.  Now does that mean change in growth rate? Probably not. Does it mean maybe that growth rate is off of some higher number later down the road? Probably so. Christopher Womack : And Steve, the only thing I'd add is we talked to you before about not just about raising growth rates, but it's about the durability and the length, how we extend the runway is something that we are keenly focused on as we've talked to you many times about. And I think that's clearly an opportunity that we are afforded by this added growth. Daniel Tucker : And then the only thing I'd add is also the thing that we are really gratified to see as part of this whole dynamic is a derisking of our outlook. Because of these customer benefits the affordability equation is greatly improved, and that's a good thing for the long-term sustainability of our business. Christopher Womack : Steve, the only thing I'd add, I mean, one of the things that we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've talked to you more about how do we use this opportunity to make sure we put downward pressure on rates across our customer classes and making sure that we price this new load in the right way. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that and having the resources and tools to do that going forward. So it provides us additional excitement for us as we go forward. Steven Fleishman : That's all helpful. And then just a different topic. Just on -- I think as you go back to the last call since then, we've had, I think, a bill on the commissioner status. I don't know if we've had an update on kind of the election court cases, and then there was that bill about bringing back a consumer council there. Just can you update us on all those developments? Christopher Womack : Yes, the consumer advocacy group inside the commission, that bill was not passed by the legislature. The legislature did pass a bill that provided what I think is some certainty around the election cycle going forward for the commissioners. There was some confusion chaos and time and schedule got a little short because of the court cases. And so as a result, the legislature didn't pass a bill that laid out the order and schedule of elections for commissioners between '25 and '28. And so the thing about that, that I think is very instructive is that the current commission in Georgia will be the commission that will sit to review Georgia Power's '25 IRP as well as Georgia '25 rate case. So there is order and schedule for the commission for the next 2 to 3 years -- out to '28. Steven Fleishman : And then just last question going back to the data center update, which was very helpful. Just we're hearing from a lot of other utilities about data center growth that they're seeing. And obviously, you're kind of somewhat at the forefront of that. But just you mentioned in some cases, taking deposits or taking money to kind of lock that in, that the customers can pay upfront. But just how are you trying to assess the risk of some of the customers putting themselves in line in 6 different regions and then in the end, only picking 2 of them and just making sure that you're not on the losing end of that? Or just trying to kind of put that into your assessment of risk. Daniel Tucker : Yes, Steve. I think that's what we tried to capture a little bit in what we laid out in the Slide 11 in our deck. It's we're not counting on those that could potentially still be trying to put multiple states or utilities on the hook, really until we have pretty firm line of sight and that bilateral conversation and commitment between them and our utilities, it's really not solidly in there. There may be some degree of risk adjusted or kind of a probability-weighted aspect just because there's so much activity out there. But we feel pretty good about -- I got I hate to use the word, but it's -- I think our forecast is fairly conservative in that regard. Operator : Our next question is from Shahr Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Can you -- just a follow up from Steve's question. Just can you elaborate a little bit on the timing of sort of any guidance update around that \"upside bias\" you just kind of referenced. I guess what's the trigger event, whether you guide to the top end a rebased higher and grow 5% to 7% off of that? I guess I'm just trying to figure out what would move that needle. What's the event? Daniel Tucker : Yes. So importantly, Shahr, the way I characterize that is that if we continue to see this momentum, right? So it's certainly not the cards we have today. The cards we have today have greatly improved our overall profile. It's added that durability. It's massively derisked kind of the outlook. But it's going to take continued momentum on this front more investment, more sales growth over the long term.  And then just in the disciplined way we do -- we're not going to make updates like that kind of intra year, right? I mean to the extent there's an update to be provided, it's going to be in our fourth quarter call, and it's going to have to be with a pretty -- as big a company as we are, a pretty significant needle-moving event within the profile. Shahriar Pourreza : That's perfect. And then, Chris, maybe just quick one for you. There's been obviously kind of a debate in the industry around the behind the meter and in front of the meter, and language from some of the hyperscalers seem to show a little bit of a preference around self-generation and self-supply with some backup capacity, which can obviously impact some of the demand numbers as we're thinking about things more prospectively, right? Chris what conversations are you having around this as you kind of engage with new customers? Christopher Womack : So I'd say we're having a lot of conversations that covering all of those options and all those considerations. I mean, I think as you talk to these hyperscalers data centers, one, they want the power. They want resilience. They want the reliability. Some of them want clean, and they recognize the demand that they're putting on load in certain locations. And so their considerations do they self generate, do they want support from behind the meter.  So I think you go across the continuum of options reflects kind of the conversations that we are having with them, one, to understand what their needs are, but also to help them understand our business and how we provide service and how we operate as a company. Yes, I mean, we're trying to -- want to serve them as customers. But I think we're also in a period where there's just a lot of instruction and education that's occurring in the marketplace today. And so the thing about our company is with all the complementary subsidiaries that we have in this portfolio, we have the opportunity to support them and help them in multiple different ways. So I think that's another aspect of our portfolio. That's pretty exciting as we look at this demand and what's happening in the marketplace today and that we have resources and capabilities to serve them and support them in a number of different ways. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Nicholas Campanella : Congrats on Vogtle, really excited stuff. So on the sales growth, you talked about things bubbling up in other jurisdictions just outside of Georgia. And can you just kind of remind us what you're assuming there, what's embedded in the plan versus where the upside of those tickers could go? Christopher Womack : I don't think there's anything embedded in the plan. I think we -- it's about announcements and that we see forthcoming. We know I think there was an announcement today in Alabama of a 200-megawatt facility that Meta just announced. And then you saw also some legislation in Mississippi that was providing incentives for data centers and other hyperscalers to come into Mississippi. So we see it coming, but that activity -- those projects have not assumed are not included in the forecast as we talk about it today. Nicholas Campanella : That's very clear. And then, Dan, I just wrapping in that $500 million to $1 billion figure that you were kind of discussing on the CapEx side. I understand this is outside the plan now and probably not coming to your yearly update. But just -- how do we think about the credit implications? And I know last quarter, I think you said you were 14% to 15% FFO to debt in '24 with a 60 basis point improvement every year thereafter. Is that still the way to kind of think about the uplift here over the next few years? Maybe you could comment on that. Daniel Tucker : Yes, absolutely, Nick. That profile we described in the fourth quarter that kind of ramps from that 14% last year up to 17% in the back half of the plan, it's absolutely still the profile to watch as this incremental capital opportunity emerges. What we'll do is issue sufficient equity probably through something like an ATM and through our plans to kind of restore the metrics to where they would have otherwise been without that incremental CapEx.  And again, kind of going back to Steve's question, yes, even doing that, this incremental CapEx will have an accretive effect. Operator : Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : So Dan, I was just curious in your commentary, you mentioned 12% growth from data center sales growth. Just can you break that for us? How much of that is new data centers versus is that -- or is it just existing data centers using newer technology? Daniel Tucker : So it's about 3/4 existing data centers and then a little bit the other quarter kind of coming from new data centers year-over-year. So we're seeing both. We're seeing a continued ramp-up of new facilities, existing facilities ramping up their usage. Durgesh Chopra : Cool. And then just one quick follow-up on the legislative front. I'm not sure if the House Bill 1192 was actually passed and signed into law, and that talks to kind of suspending the, I believe, the sales stack exemption on data centers. Maybe can you just address that? Where does that sit? And what implications, if any, do you see on the data center growth in Georgia? Christopher Womack : Yes. I mean I think that I mean, it passed and now sitting on the governor's desk and so waiting to see what happens there. I think one of the things the government wants to do is let economic development activities know that Georgia is still open for business. And so I think that's one of the key factors in consideration that he will pay attention to as he makes a decision on that bill. But right now, I don't know what will happen, but it's there for him to take action on. And so we're waiting just like everybody else to see what happens. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Congratulations on Vogtle Unit 4 there. Just wanted to continue with I guess the topic is your and given the notably higher than expected load growth in earnings, in ongoing data center investment in your service territory, just wondering how you think this impacts future generation mix and specifically coal plant retirement dates given what's happening here? Is there -- could there be deferrals or just any thoughts on that? Christopher Womack : I think that's a lot to come. And I'd add one more factor there. It's the new EPA rules, and we saw the suite of announcements that came out of EPA last week, which we are reviewing. And many of the rules we think are in practical in terms of aligning with the kind of demand that we see forthcoming, and also from a technology standpoint, some expectations that they are advocating and putting forward don't align necessarily with the reality. So there's a lot of -- I think a lot of issues that are up in the air. At the state level, I think as we look at how we respond to the demand, how we respond to this need, all those considerations must be on the table in terms of new generation, what happens to existing generation. Those all get extended, what happens there? All of that has to be on the table, but we also have to factor in what are the potential new rules from the [indiscernible] Protection Agency. So I would say all of that is very subject to for the consideration as we move forward through all the processes that we'll be a part of. Jeremy Tonet : That makes sense. And how do you think about the feasibility of carbon capture in your territories? Christopher Womack : Geologically, yes. I mean there are places down on the coast. The mobile area, some parts of Mississippi, where we have the geology for sequestration. But once again, I think as you look at what is somewhat predicated in some of these roles and the expectations and what the desires are -- is the technology available at a commercial scale to do what they're asking us to do. I think there are a lot of questions there. So I think it's -- I go back to these rules, I think they are in practical at this time. And so I think there's more work to be done and more conversations to be had about how they should go forward. But we're still doing the analysis because it's a lot of pages, a lot of work, and then we've got to decide what we do going forward in terms of litigation and whether it's with our stage, whether it's with the other different associations. So there's a lot of work to be done there, a lot more conversations to be had. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. And one last one, if I could. Just given nuclear ability to offer base load that is very suitable for data center and other demand as such. Just wondering any updated thoughts on the viability of that technology down the road? And how Southern thinks about that? Christopher Womack : I mean I can give you my speech if you'd like to hear it. I mean the country is going to need more nuclear. I mean there's clearly no technology better suited to support demands of this increasingly digital economy and society. And so I think the federal government has got to step in and provide great leadership to incent companies to move in that direction. I'd also say we're going to celebrate what we've done at Vogtle for a very long time before we give any consideration to any more. But we think others, they have the opportunity and should really look at this country has to look at new nuclear to go forward to meet this growing demand. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities. Anthony Crowdell : Yes. I think that last question was asking you about Vogtle 5 and 6, but I'm not sure. But I guess just a quick one. Last month, there was approval overwhelmingly approved the Georgia Public Service Commission, the IRP. But just curious, any commentary on some of the language related to rate increases. And you guys have laid out, especially on the slides, great information on how you're navigating the challenges of adding all this infrastructure, but focus on the customer bill. And just if you could tie that to the language on one of the approved -- during the approval with maybe no more bill increases. Daniel Tucker : Yes, Anthony, this is Dan. Look, I think largely, any commentary you heard was simply focused on affordability and ensuring that the benefits that Georgia Power said we're there, end up reflected in customer rates. And that's exactly what the stipulation does is provide that commitment so that when we file the 2025 rate case, one of those moving parts is going to include incorporating those economic benefits for all customers into that calculation. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Agnieszka Storozynski : So first maybe about your -- the Southeast Energy exchange market. So when it was first created, I thought that was a sign that maybe there's some excess power in your neck of boots and then you're trying to distribute it to other parts of the Southeast. Now I'm thinking the other way. But maybe there's a way to move some power into Georgia to actually address the load growth. Again, I'm just clearly fishing for any upside potential associated with this newly created power market? Christopher Womack : Angie, I think it is what it is. I mean it was intended to move around the partners and participants of excess capacity. And so that's what it has been doing, I think, has been very successful, but I don't think it signals anything more than that. I mean that simply is it's doing what we intended to do with all the participants. And so we'll continue to utilize that. Now how does it factor into the additional growth? I mean we'll step back and look at it. But it doesn't signal anything more than what we intended to be when we made all the filings and got all the approval. Daniel Tucker : Yes. And really just to create a more nimble market for those intermittent resources to make sure that customers, wherever it's needed benefit from that very, very low-cost energy. Agnieszka Storozynski : And so on a similar vein here, about Southern Powers. I understand that it's fully contracted for now. And I'm just wondering when do you have some open capacity there, which could potentially benefit from this run up and full with power curves that we're seeing in other markets. That's number one.  And number 2 is, so when you hear hyperscalers talk about contracting for supply of power, they do talk about net 0, right? So I'm wondering, is there a way for Southern Power to, for example, participate in these negotiations, for example, plug into the Mississippi Power Grid, but address the carbon footprint of that supply with building contract-based solar or some other resources that could basically provide the carbon-free offsets? Daniel Tucker : Yes. Look, so I'll start with the second question first. Look, Southern Power is always going to evaluate opportunities to serve load-serving entities, right? And so to the extent those opportunities present themselves in any of our jurisdictions where it makes sense, we'll evaluate that. And you've seen that happen in the past, particularly in Georgia.  On the first question in terms of the kind of the portfolio, yes, look, it's very highly covered the next 5 years. And -- but if you think about 5 years out, that's the end of the decade, that's when other resource needs begin to emerge. That's when you start seeing utilities around the Southeast, begin to consider the -- how long with their assets be on the ground.  So I think once you start looking towards the end of the decade and into the 30s, Southern Power will have a lot of opportunity to take advantage of what we're seeing today. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Paul Fremont : Congrats on Vogtle, great seeing both units and commercial operations. So great job there. I guess my first question is on HP1192, if the governor were to sign the bill, would that essentially slow down the addition of data centers in the state of Georgia or put you in a relative -- or put your stated at a relative disadvantage to other states? Christopher Womack : And Paul, I think it's hard to answer that question, but I would think not, but also I think you have to look at the competitive nature of economic development across states. And where does it put Georgia and then what signal does it send. But also, I think it's about -- it's a big question about resilience and the ability to meet the demands of these customers and not just reliably, but providing them the resilience they expect and the demand.  But I think it's I think just a straight answer to your question, I think it's probably not, but I think at the same time, it's a competitive nature of economic development by states that I think you have to say what have to evaluate very closely. Paul Fremont : And then my other question has to do with sort of the tougher EPA rules. If those ultimately were to be adopted, does that -- do you need to accelerate the time frame for coal plant retirements? Christopher Womack : And Paul, that's like we're evaluating those rules as we speak today. And I mean I think there's a lot we've kind of gotten to very quickly on the gas side in terms of capacity factors and the expectations for carbon capture. I mean I think there's more work for us to do in terms of the coal implications. But at first blush, like I said, I think they're in practical and probably yet would make it more difficult to run coal units as well any longer. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : What time frame or cadence do you expect some of these data center companies that are shopping multiple jurisdictions to make a decision? And then in terms of in development projects, it looks like there was 3 pending construction at the time of the stipulated agreement testimony. Have those pending construction data centers started construction? Or any update you could provide on that? Daniel Tucker : I don't know that we have the specific construction updates, Ryan, but I will tell you just in general, this is -- I mean, think of it as a continuous kind of waterfall, right? I mean there are always data centers coming in and exploring and then committing. And so it's just -- it's an ongoing thing. So we've got -- right now, there's 12 under construction that totaled about 2,400 megawatts. Ryan Levine : So that includes 1 or 2 that are still pending, okay. And then given that the continuous nature to the extent that the momentum were to continue to build, is there a time frame that you may seek to reengage the updated IRP process? Or any kind of framework you might apply to assess when additional resources may need to be get approval for? Christopher Womack : I think we said before, Georgia has an RFP in 2025. And so they'll factor in new requests, new demands, new load doing that proceeding. Alabama and Mississippi will do make similar decisions in their processes based on the demands and requests that they receive as well. Daniel Tucker : And coming out of this last process, Ryan, there was a part of the stipulation is that Georgia will kind of keep the staff and commission updated a little more -- it's not real time, but on a quarterly basis, kind of leading up to the next formal process that way everyone kind of has line of sight as to what is emerging. Christopher Womack : Because it goes back to some of the points we laid out in the prepared remarks. Is this load real? And so I think that quarterly update helps give the commission and the staff the information they need to give confirmation of the reality of this load. Daniel Tucker : And that next regular filing is scheduled for next January '25. Ryan Levine : And then last question for me. In terms of the customer preference for or carbon resources. Any stipulations or any requirements that they're speaking to specifically as they're looking to decide what locations to locate their data centers? Christopher Womack : I mean early on, we saw a lot of requests for 24/7 carbon-free of late. We see the request for do you have power. And like I said, we continue to build additional carbon-free resources. And so we'll continue to work with them. But right now, I think there is just a simple desire and request for resources for energy. Daniel Tucker : And we're very transparent about our own transition plans. And I think that is an opportunity for them to kind of latch on to transitioning along with us. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Travis Miller : Also congrats on Vogtle and I thought it was a very good choice of words arduous in your prepared remarks. I appreciate that. Christopher Womack : We chose that word very carefully. Travis Miller : I figured. On the load forecast and specifically even the Georgia IRP, what does that mean for T&D investment? Is there upside there in addition to the generation upside you talked about? Daniel Tucker : Yes. And so if you remember, Travis, part of our year-end update on the capital plan, I mean, it totaled $5 billion of increased capital. There was a big piece of that, that was also transmission, and that will continue to be part of the long-term planning discussions we have with our states.  Absolutely, as we add new resources, transmission considerations have to take place absolutely as our fleet transitions from its current state to its future state, transmission considerations are part of that. So they will clearly be transmission opportunities along the way here. Christopher Womack : And I'll also add, there's got to be some additional build-out of gas infrastructure as well. I mean, so there's a lot more infrastructure that's got to be built to support the generation resources to meet this demand. Travis Miller : And then can you remind us the Alabama and Mississippi IRP schedules? And then in addition to that, would you expect some similar issues to come up as what came up in Georgia in those states? Or is there something different going on there? Daniel Tucker : We don't want to get too far ahead of exactly what it will look like in terms of if there's suddenly this accelerated load. But so the next scheduled processes. We got Mississippi, we'll launch a process and -- or they launched the process in April rather they're going through that now and Alabama will have one next spring 2025. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Christopher Womack : I think it's -- let me call by saying this. Understandably, I mean, Vogtle 3 and 4, the journey that we've been through, took a lot of attention from our stakeholders and have met fewer conversations focused on our underlying business and the success of our underlying business.  The fact is all along, we continue to execute at a very high level across our portfolio and delivered strong results. Reliability and customer service were outstanding. Investments in critical financial structure we made in every jurisdiction. We successfully navigated our regulatory processes and received constructive outcomes.  Now as we look ahead in what's next, it's this, a continued unrelenting focus on the fundamentals with customers at the center of everything that we do. Serving the growing load we're experiencing is what we were built for and our model is designed to turn that growth into value for all stakeholders, customers and investors alike.  That is what the employees of Southern companies do. It might sound boring to some, but it's exciting for us. Thank you for spending time with us today. And operator, that's the end of this call. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Sherry, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everybody to the Southern Company Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Gammill : Thank you, Sherry. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we've released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn it over to Chris. Chris Womack : Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate provided last quarter. We believe we are well-positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2024. All our businesses, electric and gas, are performing well, and we continue to see both economic resilience and economic growth, especially within our southeast service territories. During the most recent heat wave across the southeast, our dedicated employees, supported by our coordinated planning, ensured our electric system delivered outstanding reliability and resiliency for the customers and communities that we are privileged to serve. Last quarter represented the warmest second quarter in the last 38 years, with a peak electric load of over 38,000 megawatts, the third highest June peak electric load on record for the Southern Company system. We take tremendous pride in our ability to reliably serve our customers through all operating conditions. Our performance continues to highlight the value of the integrated regulated framework in which we operate. Coordinating planning for generation and transmission as well as our robust portfolio of natural gas transportation, capacity, and storage have positioned us to effectively manage peak demand needs. This same framework, including our orderly internal and external regulatory processes for long term demand planning and resource decisions, is what also positions us so well to reliably serve the significant electric load growth projected over the next decade, an opportunity we're excited about. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Dan Tucker : Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of 2024, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.10 per share, $0.31 higher than the second quarter of 2023 and $0.20 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were continued investment in our state regulated utilities and warmer than normal weather for our electric subsidiaries. This was somewhat offset by higher interest and depreciation expenses. A complete reconciliation of year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted EPS estimate for the third quarter is $1.30 per share. As Chris noted, all of our businesses experienced a strong second quarter leading to adjusted financial results meaningfully higher than our estimate of $0.90 per share. The warmer than normal weather in the Q2 contributed to these results as well as our continued focus on managing operating costs. Additionally, during the second quarter, we experienced higher than expected weather adjusted electricity sales in our commercial customer class. These higher sales were driven by a combination of continued strength in our local economies as well as increased usage by many of our existing data center customers. In fact, sales to existing data centers for the quarter were up approximately 17% year-over-year. The strong Southeast economy, including favorable business climates and expansions in manufacturing, continues to drive net in migration and customer growth. For the second quarter, we saw residential customer additions of 14,000 in our electric businesses and 6,000 in our natural gas distribution businesses. We also continue to see strong economic development activity across our electric service territories. The aggregate pipeline for potential new industrial and commercial customers across our 3 state electric utility footprint includes nearly 200 projects and over 30 gigawatts of potential load over the next decade or so. While it's likely these numbers include some degree of duplication as in potential projects as some prospective customers are evaluating multiple states that we serve for their facilities, these numbers are significantly higher than what we've seen historically. About 40% of the projects in the pipeline and 80% of the potential electric load are data centers. In addition to data centers, clean energy and transportation manufacturing, port related businesses and other heavy industries continue to be attracted to our states due to reliable energy, a diverse workforce, robust transportation networks and a low cost of living, all compelling reasons to locate or expand in our Southeastern states. The potential load growth in this pipeline that is reflected in our forecast is currently only a fraction of this full potential. As a reminder, during our year-end earnings call in February, we updated our forecast to reflect projected retail electric sales growth that is expected to accelerate in the latter part of this decade with a projected growth rate of approximately 6% from 2025 to 2028. The underlying Georgia Power projected sales growth is approximately 9% over the same period. In response to this growth, Georgia Power filed and the Georgia Public Service Commission subsequently approved earlier this year its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan Update. Since the time of the original filing last year, Georgia Power's pipeline of potential large load additions by the mid-2030 has grown approximately 40%, and the amount of committed peak demand at the same time frame has more than doubled, now totaling over 7 gigawatts. As we described in detail on our last earnings call, we continue to execute on our disciplined approach to attracting, serving, pricing and forecasting this potential incremental electric load, and we continue to expect that our disciplined approach to pricing this new load should result in revenues that not only cover the incremental cost to serve these new customers, but also provides economic benefits to existing customers. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Chris Womack : Thanks, Dan. Southern Company remains focused on execution, and we're excited about the future. We believe we are well-positioned to capture the value of this significant electricity demand for the benefits of all stakeholders. Our orderly and proven processes for engaging with prospective customers and for addressing resource needs with our regulators, differentiates Southern Company from our peers and helps mitigate risk for our customers and our investors. Additionally, prospective electric customers are increasingly recognizing the value of our institutional experience and wherewithal, the value of the great states we operate in, and the value of the vertically-integrated regulated utility model. Before taking your questions this afternoon, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hundreds of team members from Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power who recently returned home, after aiding in power restorations in Texas following the devastation caused by Hurricane Beryl. These teams and others from across our industry worked tirelessly to bring relief to affected communities, and their performance throughout the successful restoration effort stands as a testament that our employees are at their very best when conditions are at their worst. Let me conclude by saying, we have delivered very strong operational and financial results for the first half of this year. We will remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan, and we believe that we are extraordinarily well positioned to deliver the superior performance that you expect from us for the remainder of the year. Operator, we're now ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Maybe just to start on the quarter itself, I guess just with the significant beat relative to your initial $0.90 guidance, sort of how are you thinking about the puts and takes around the full year guidance and your execution there at this point? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : Look, we're always very cautious. While we're halfway through the year, there's a lot of year left to go. And in particular, with our electric utilities being in the Southeast, the summer is a pretty big period from a revenue perspective. So we've typically kind of hone in on a more specific expectation after our third quarter call. That said, to your point, we are incredibly well-positioned. We're off to a great start. And what we also have a history of doing is really taking that kind of opportunity and doing anything and everything that we can to not only deliver on the current year, but use that as an opportunity to improve our positioning for future years. So that might look like advancing maintenance work out of future years into 2024 or getting ahead on other programs or reliability reserves. We have the opportunity to kind of optimize in some of our states. And so with how we're positioned, we're working hard to do all those things, focus on this year, but focus on the long term. But, you know, all that to say, given how we started, if we, you know, don't end up in the top half of our range, I think Chris and I would be disciplined. Chris Womack : But I think, Dan, I think as we say internally a lot, when we have the opportunity to fix the roof while the sun is shining, and so thinking about '24 and '25 and '26, those are some things we'll consider as we continue to move forward through this year. Carly Davenport : Great. Appreciate that color. And then the follow-up, just would love to get your perspectives on nuclear as it continues to gain focus here. I guess, what do you think the industry needs to do to support the build out of new large scale nuclear? And as you think about the 2025 Georgia IRP filing, is there any potential to see nuclear play a role there? Chris Womack : Carly, I mean, I think the industry has got to continue to do all the planning, all the reviews, working with industries to look at what all the possibilities may be. I think to ultimately get that build out and get the momentum, we've got to have incredible leadership from the government, to make this a reality. We know there are risks, and I think we all must find ways, and I think support from the government can help mitigate some of that risk. So I think that is the critical element in terms of really gaining the momentum to build on what we got done by completing both units 3 and 4. I think it's got to be a part of the future. It's got be a part of the mix. We've got have diverse resources to meet this demand we see going forward, and nuclear's got a play a very prominent part in that role. But I think there's got be and needs to be great leadership from the government to really kind of help build the momentum that I that we need to see. I mean, I'll leave it at that. Operator : Our next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Excellent. So, Dan, I can maybe a quick one for Dan. Dan, I can totally appreciate the conservativeness and sort of how you're messaging around this year. But like obviously like we are seeing much stronger the reality of your sort of your footprint is much stronger than kind of your planning assumptions. Right? And I know you've talked about in the past that maybe you can provide an update in the fourth quarter or potentially EEI timeframe of what all this kind of means to your longer range guidance. I guess what other trigger points are you looking for outside of sustainability around this load backdrop to really revisit how you guys think about a longer range plan? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : I think it does. I know you said besides sustainability, but it really is rooted in that notion of continued momentum. Look, I think we feel good about what we know and see right in front of us, and that's a large part of what we addressed in this recent Georgia proceeding. We've got the 2025 IRP ahead of us, that will provide an opportunity to kind of further button up the latter part of the decade and into the next decade. For again, what we kind of know sitting here today, the opportunity and it certainly feels like there is continued increased momentum. The opportunity is that, assuming that continues, there will inevitably be more capital investment needed to serve continued load growth, whether that's in the form of new generation resources, certainly transmission improvements around the system. But the thing I want to balance all of that with and I think we've continued to say this, this is really a later in the decade phenomenon. This is not a '25 thing. This is starting to bleed into '26. But because of the long term nature of these capital investments, because of the long-term nature of building out these data centers, it this is an opportunity that sustains beyond the current forecast period, the kind of financial profile and strength that we see. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just, Chris, on your end, I know, obviously, we've got a Georgia GRC coming. It's going to come sooner than we think. There's been some noise around sort of ROEs and equity ratios maybe being overly adequate now that Vogtle is online from just some of the commissioners. Can you maybe just talk this through a bit? Is this going to be an issue as you prep for the case? Have you begun discussions kind of with stakeholders ahead of this filing? Chris Womack : I mean, there's always conversations about those matters as we go through those proceedings. And so I would not be surprised. I mean, we always have good deliberations about those issues in terms of where we are and recognizing the level of service that we provide and the premium nature of how we run this business. I mean, equity ratio also came from a tax reform issue, not just from Vogtle. I mean, so there are a lot of implications. And so, as usual, I mean, as we go through '25, all of these issues, I think, will be thoroughly vetted and thoroughly, debated, recognized. And also, once again, as I said, recognizing how we perform as a company. A \u2013 Dan Tucker : The equity ratio kind of changes were broad based. This is not just a Georgia conversation. It was in all of our states and Chris made the point, that was for tax reform. It was coincidentally during the construction of Vogtle, but had nothing to do with Vogtle construction itself. Unless there's some major change to the tax policy that has implications, I think defending that is where we will start from. Operator : Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Look, speaking of having the sunshine, I think you guys have starting the year off pretty well. It's nice to see. Maybe to turn that into a specific question. You've got this $1.30 out there. Just to kick it off, you've probably seen some continuation of that good weather from 2Q into 3Q. Is that already reflected in that $1.30 or is there some more upside there? Because you already had $0.10 versus normal in the second quarter? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : What we would typically do, Julian, and what we've certainly done in this case is put out a quarterly estimate that is weather normal. There's always still at least 2 months left in the quarter when we put these out and just anecdotally, I would say, I think this is the first day in about 3 weeks that it hasn't rained here in Atlanta. So I'm not so sure that July has looked like June too. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: It sounds like Texas as far as rig go. Anyway, just to keep going on that. In terms of the backdrop of the loan growth here, I just want to make sure I'm hearing because clearly on this, right? The 17% is phenomenal on the data center load growth, how do you think about that number in terms of the medium and longer term? And you've obviously provided some very healthy longer-term loan growth numbers. Should we expect that to continue to compound kind of consistently through the period here or to what extent actually could we see an acceleration of that number here? I mean there's a lot of talk about building infrastructure, but you guys are realizing it in a much more tangible way than perhaps some of your peers. A \u2013 Dan Tucker : Great question. So let me just kind of clarify the dynamics that are happening. That 17% that we referred to is existing data centers that are on the ground have been on the ground and they're either in the process of ramping to their full load or, in some cases, what we believe is also happening as some of these are actually improving the technology in the data centers with not only increasing processing capabilities, but that's also utilizing a little bit more electricity in the process. What will happen going forward, while this dynamic will be there, this is a small component of our overall commercial sales today? The -- everything we've been talking about in terms of what drives that 6% sales growth from '25 to '28, 9% at Georgia Power. Those are new data centers. And so it will be a significant acceleration that begins to happen in the '26, '27, '28 time frame and beyond, as these data centers are completed and they too will have their own ramp-ups to the point where overall commercial sales growth implicit in that 6% will be in the double-digits. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. But the point is all 17% looks phenomenal you just think that acceleration is obviously accentuated in '26. And we can see continued ramping of the existing base in '25. Operator : Our next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Great commentary here just on the load growth that you're seeing in data center commentary. Are you tracking ahead of that 6% assumption? I feel like things are pretty fluid and moving quickly. Are there indications that it could be stronger from here? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : I think given how the pipeline is evolving, there are indications the long term could certainly be stronger. So again, we're talking into the decade into the 2030s, the way that is building the momentum is very promising. In terms of the very near term, Dave, like the 17% we were just talking about, even if that swung a little bit. It's such a small piece today, it's not going to have a meaningful impact on kind of current results. It really is about the capital being deployed in the big hyperscale data centers that are due to be online a little bit here in a few years. David Arcaro : Yes. Got it. That makes sense. And I was thinking about the load growth overall. And let's see, the other -- the other item I just wanted to check on, there was a valve issue at Vogtle 3 recently. Just wondering if you had any feedback on that kind of the extent of that issue? And anything else to watch for there. Chris Womack : Yes. No, they worked through that issue and the unit is now back online and Vogtle 3 has operated more than 98% is capacity factor over the period. So those things will happen, with new units, but we're very pleased with the performance of Vogtle 3 and Vogtle 4. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Chris. First, just wanted to clarify on the data center. So I think on the Q1 call, you gave a number of pipeline of 21 gigawatts firm commitment of 6.2 gigawatts by the mid-2030s. Does that sound right? What are those numbers now? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : Sure. And so I'm going to even take it a little bit further back to you because I think the progression here is important. So you mentioned the 21 gigawatts that was where we were as of our last call, and that's compared to 17 gigawatts back when we originally filed the 2023 IRP update at Georgia Power. So it had grown 4,000 gigawatts -- as we sit here today, that 21 gigawatts is 24.3 gigawatts in terms of the total pipeline. You mentioned the commitments. The commitments were a significant change from the original filing last quarter. So it went from 3.6 gigawatts to 6.2 gigawatts. And then from the last earnings call to today, that 6.2 gigawatts is now 7.3 gigawatts. Steve Fleishman : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then a totally separate question. The -- on Kinder Morgan's call, they mentioned expanding the SONAT system with $3 billion, I think, growth investment and kind of, I think, implied that you would represent half of it? And could you just talk to your thoughts on that and likelihood you'll do that? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : Yes. Look, it's really early for that. So yes, we're a 50% partner on Southern Natural. There is a project that is proposed that total capital is $3 billion. Our share would be $1.5 billion. It's just really early days. You know how these projects evolve. Look, we're very encouraged by it. It\u2019s 90-plus percent, I believe, brownfield, existing rights of way, a tremendous opportunity there. We will kind of at the right time down the road once this thing has solidified a little bit more, there's some traction from a FERC perspective, in terms of approval kind of reflect that more in our outlook. But that's still -- all that said, it's an encouraging opportunity. Chris Womack : Steve, the only thing I would add, I think Dan said it, but it's just very early on in that process. I think there's a great deal of diligence to be done. But I think at this point in time, I think the thing to note is that's just very early on in that consideration. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And last question -- A \u2013 Dan Tucker : Going to say just policy wise, I mean we're excited about it. To the extent that we can get this done, it's important for everything else is happening, right? To the extent that all this large load is down the road has the opportunity to be served with more gas capacity like this is really important. And so we're super supportive. Chris Womack : Yes, Steven, let me add 1 more thing on that. I mean -- and we talk a lot about the importance of this country, building infrastructure. So these kind of things need to happen to support this economy going forward. But for us, it's just very early on, but it's somethings that this country must embrace and must move forward on. Steve Fleishman : Okay. One last question, just going back to my first topic on data centers. Can you just remind me what -- how you define firm commitments relative to pipeline for data centers? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : Yes. So the commitment we're characterizing is essentially signed request for service within our service territory. It's a commitment by the customer to be at a particular level to commitment by us to provide the service -- and then a lot of these commitments have kind of further papering, if you will, that goes beyond those kind of key elements where it's commitments for local infrastructure, commitments around pricing, commitments around the ramp so there's clearly different stages here. I think, importantly, because we argue with ourselves what is the right nomenclature for this, what's the right word to really characterize this because commitment sounds like something that's completely fixed and unreversible. The reality is we have these commitments. These requests for services and over time, there's puts and takes. And in fact, in the numbers I shared with you a few minutes ago, Steve, there were puts and takes in there. But net-net, the megawatts are still going up. Chris Womack : And Steve, last earnings call, we went through this, I guess, process, this orderly process that we go through internal in terms of confirming that this load is, in fact, real. And so if you look -- remember some of that, I mean, that's kind of the discipline in which we look at these projects to make sure they are real that they've demonstrated a commitment to the state that they've selected our utility companies. I mean a very orderly and disciplined process that we go through because actually, we've been in the second development business for a very, very long time. I mean we're in the market each and every day engaging with customers. But we know how this plays out. We know how it works and so for us as well as for them, it's important to understand what's real in terms of -- and what it means to have a commitment. So we spend a lot of time working on this. A \u2013 Dan Tucker : And so importantly, I'll just last thing, Steve, I'll just to clarify, commitment for us does not mean it's in our forecast. There's further risk adjustment from there. There's -- we know that things will get delayed. We know that the actual peak load alluded to may not show up to that extent, but there'll be load, but not that much. So we're risk adjusting beyond this commitment level to be conservative but also as pragmatic as we can with the forecast. Steve Fleishman : And then lastly, the 9% Georgia Power growth rate, that was based off of the initial numbers that you gave at the end of '23 for when you had the filing. A \u2013 Dan Tucker : Yes, there is potential for those to evolve, and I think that's what we will -- we will see where we are at the time of the 2025 IRP filing. Operator : Our next question is from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Nick Campanella : Hey, a lot of questions have been answered, but I guess just I know that there's been potential for DOE loans to enter the portfolio and hopefully, that's coming up soon. But just can you just remind us how that could affect your overall financing plans and what could maybe be on the table, if anything? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : Sure. Nick, happy to. So look, there's -- we believe -- and the DOE in the details as we work through this process with the DOE loan office, there could be big round numbers, eligible capital in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion over the next, I don't know, 7 to 8 years or so that could qualify for this. And the program allows that qualified capital to be financed up to 80% of the qualifying amount. So that's a significant amount of debt financing that could be done through a very low-cost source relative to the capital markets. Implication of that is a potential tremendous benefit to customers over time, not unlike what we had with Vogtle 3 and 4 in terms of the loan program there. Again, this program could potentially be 3x, 4x the size of the Vogtle 3 and 4 program, which created tremendous savings for customers. Nick Campanella : I appreciate that. And maybe just one conceptual question here, just -- we've heard about economic development on your call on all of your peers' calls this earnings season, the tailwinds continue to be very strong. I can't help but notice that some economic and industrial indicators are now starting to roll. ISM indicators this morning were at their lowest since the pandemic. And I guess my question is, just what's differentiating your service territory, you think? On the economic development side? And then is this just all kind of chalking up to maybe you guys being conservative in this 5% to 7% outlook and waiting for it to come. Chris Womack : No, and we talked about it earlier on this call about the reliability and the performance of our company, the cost of living in the territory, the transportation hubs and access and resources that we have here, the kind of business climate, Alabama was recently recognized by CNBC as a top state to do business in. And so great advancements there. So I think a collection of things that occurring across the southeastern territory has really made -- has been attractive for a long period of time and continues to make this part of the country very attractive. And so I think we have a lot of good things going forward. And so we're kind of excited about where we are. And it shows up in the pipeline of business in the projects that are currently in the queue in all of our states -- all of our Southeastern states. So I think it speaks well for the characteristics of our states and where we are. And also, I think our vertically integrated model also supports kind of -- this is a good place to come and do business. Operator : Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Just then, as we think about your forward-looking guidance and your 2024 base, you've obviously started the year phenomenal year-to-date materially above the plan, but there are some one-timers in there like weather. So as we think about our models and '26, '27 EPS estimates and beyond, -- are you -- when you rebate whenever you provide this guidance at Q4, are you going to exclude these onetime benefits in 2024? I'm just trying to think of what should be the base of the new 5% to 7%, if you will. A \u2013 Dan Tucker : The base for the 5% to 7% is the current guidance in 2024, $3.95 to $4.05. The way to think about -- so you mentioned weather as an example, Durgesh, you heard us describe kind of the notion of fixing the roof while the sun is shining, advancing maintenance out of future years in this year. If you look back over the course of time at our O&M spend, while on average, it's probably flattish to down over time. Year-to-year, it's more of a sign wave, because again, what we're doing is managing the short term, taking advantage of opportunities like warmer-than-normal summers colder than normal winters, such that in other years, where we have milder weather, 2023 being a great example, we have the flexibility to spend less. And so we're managing to a regular predictable kind of sustainable results year-in and year-out despite what might be characterized as 1x things. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. So basically, and then just one quick follow-up on credit metrics and FFO to debt. I think this year, in -- this is from the Q1 call, I believe, but you were kind of trending towards 14% by the end of this year and then 16% to 17% by the end of the planning period in 2028. How does that outlook get strengthened here given the year-to-date outperformance as we think about the end of 2024? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : I think we are where we were. You heard Chris and I allude to maybe being disappointed if we're not in the top half of the range. So maybe there's some incremental benefit for 2024. But I think in terms of the trajectory we're on, we are exactly where we were and how you described it. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to come back to the SONAT expansion, if I could, in the open season. I was just wondering if you're able to share any color on shipper interest there and whether that was a larger Southern or there was others that came in with good demand there. Chris Womack : I think it's very premature. I mean we have no insight or perspective on that at this time. It's just very early in the process. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Fair enough. And then -- just wondering, as you sit back today, how you think about the current business mix in additional exposure as the electric backdrop is changing for load growth. Is there any rotation of assets that you might be interested in here? A \u2013 Dan Tucker : Yes. I don't think we're there. I mean we love the portfolio we have. We've done a lot of work over the years to kind of hone it to the portfolio it is today. We've got great electric and gas jurisdictions at large. We've got great complements with Southern Power. So no, there's certainly no designs on anything like that as we sit here today. Operator : And our next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar Inc. Travis Miller : Back to the data center conversation. As you go through those numbers and you talked about risk adjusting and all of that, what are the regulatory hurdles, the state regulatory hurdles that you face in terms of thinking about that risk adjustment and some of those numbers actually coming to fruition? Chris Womack : Once the Travis, as we go back to a pretty detailed conversation we had on our last call, it's also going to the commissions to confirm the reality of the projects, understanding what the risks are, understanding the pricing that needs to take place that make sure that we are working with these customers to really fully load, understand what the incremental costs are and their marginal costs are and how we price that. So that we also -- when we do this, we're providing benefits to the rest of the customers in terms of what sometimes we refer to as downward pressure. So just as we work to confirm reality and commitments, but also then do risk adjusting, having that same kind of process and conversation with the regulatory jurisdictions in terms of understanding the reality and then understanding the financial and pricing implications. And so 1 thing that I feel really good about is this kind of orderly process that we have to work through this with the commissions, but also the ability to work through this with their respective customers. So I just feel real good about kind of our process to give order to sometimes what looks like a lot of chaos in this marketplace. I think we have the experience, we have the wherewithal, we have these constructive regulatory environments, and we have the framework to do this, I think, in a way that makes sure that is orderly and disciplined and provides benefits to all stakeholders. Travis Miller : Sure, sure. And do each of those contracts need official regulatory sign-off? Or can you negotiate those without regulatory sign-off state regulatory? Chris Womack : Yes, we can negotiate that without regulatory approval. Travis Miller : Okay. Very good. And then real quick, what's the long-term planning process timing in Alabama and Mississippi in terms of when we might get more information on data center load or total C&I load growth there. Chris Womack : You'll see those conversations, I think, on a regular basis annually. I mean, it's a little different than what happens in Georgia. But the -- as we look at their plans and look at the issues and needs that show up, I mean they'll take that to the commissions for first certification. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Chris Womack : Again, thanks, everybody, for taking time to be with us. We feel good about where we are as a company and how we're performing and executing and we're incredibly excited about the future. Thanks for being with us today and be safe. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company's second quarter 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Southern Company's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Greg MacLeod. Thank you. You may begin. Greg MacLeod : Thank you, Julian. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that, we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Womack. Chris Womack : Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our entire company including our premier state-regulated electric gas and utilities, continued to perform well during the third quarter, especially as our dedicated employees across Southern Company came together as one team in response to Hurricane Helene. The resolve and the professionalism of our employees has never been more evident than was demonstrated through the recent storm restoration efforts in Georgia. Before Dan provides an overview of our financial results, I'd like to share our story from this unprecedented weather event. Hurricane Helene was a storm of historic magnitude. Its aftermath was met with an extraordinary response from our dedicated team across Southern Company, our mutual assistance partners, state and local first responders and emergency management agencies and government officials, all across Georgia. Persistent rain, extreme flooding and heavy winds resulted in what can only be characterized as devastation to many of the communities we serve, with the destruction stretching hundreds of miles impacting the Eastern two-thirds of the entire state. Ultimately, the damage caused by Hurricane Helene was the most destructive in Georgia Power's 140-year history, exceeding the damage caused by the largest -- the three largest storms to impact Georgia Power's service territory combined. Helene entered Southern Georgia as a Category one hurricane and resulted in 53 out of the 159 counties in the state being declared major disaster areas by the Federal Energy -- Emergency Management Agency. With considerable damage to transmission infrastructure, nearly 12,000 damaged utility poles and some 1,500 miles of downed wires, the equivalent of the distance between Atlanta and Phoenix, Arizona, our customers' experienced over 1.5 million outages in the wake of the storm. With the support of resources from across North America, a workforce of well over 20,000 worked around the clock to safely reconnect customers through extremely difficult conditions. Commensurate with the devastation seen in our communities, much of our utility infrastructure was damaged beyond near repair, and significant portion of our system in the affected regions require a complete rebuild. Thanks to the contributions of our utility industry partners and especially thanks to the unwavering commitment of our own hard-working dedicated crews, many of whom lived in the same communities and some of whom endured destruction to their own homes, the restoration and rebuilding efforts were 95% complete within eight days with power restored to over 0.5 million customers within the first 48 hours. We are incredibly proud of our team's response and eternally grateful to be a part of an industry that works so well together in times of need. Many of the communities we are privileged to serve across Eastern Georgia have a long road ahead to recovery, Georgia Power, Atlanta Gas Light. Southern Company are contributing to organizations to aid these communities and Georgia Power has taken additional steps to provide support and resources to our customers in Georgia. In our business model, customers are at the center of everything we do. And our commitment to the communities and customers we serve has never been more important than in times like these. I am extremely proud of our team's exceptional efforts to clearly demonstrate that we are a citizen wherever we serve each and every day. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Dan Tucker : Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. Before I walk through the third quarter financial results, I'd like to briefly address the costs associated with the recovery efforts Chris just described related to Hurricane Helene. The initial estimated cost for this historic storm-related restoration and rebuild is approximately $1.1 billion. The unprecedented destruction associated with this weather event combined with impacts of inflation on the cost of contract labor, supplies, food, fuel, and lodging contribute to the overall cost. Our estimate is subject to change over the next several months as estimates are replaced with bills from our mutual assistance partners as we complete the final cleanup of damaged equipment and as we work to ensure the impacted areas are restored to meet our standards for long-term reliability. That is not to suggest that our estimate is likely to materially change, but rather to acknowledge that it takes time to fully capture the ultimate cost of such an extensive endeavor. Turning now to our financial results. For the third quarter of 2024, our adjusted earnings were $1.43 per share $0.01 higher than the third quarter of 2023. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were continued investment in our state-regulated utilities and customer growth. This was mostly offset by higher interest, depreciation, and other operating expenses. And for the nine months ended September 30th, 2024, our adjusted earnings per share were $3.56 compared with adjusted earnings per share of $3.01 for the same period in 2023. One of the largest drivers in our year-to-date results compared with the prior year is weather-related impacts from an extremely mild first half of 2023, contrasted with the weather effects we've experienced thus far in 2024. A complete reconciliation of the year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted EPS estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.49 per share, which combined with our year-to-date performance, would represent full year adjusted earnings of $4.05 per share. After excluding a 0.4% negative impact of lost sales that resulted from the damage caused by Hurricane Helene, weather-normalized total retail electricity sales were essentially flat compared with the third quarter of 2023. The broad strength of the economy in the Southeast was exhibited in the quarter by strong electricity sales in the chemical, pipeline, and transportation segments, as well as data center power usage which continued its positive trend and was up 10% year-over-year. And while weather-normalized residential electricity usage per customer was slightly down in the quarter, we saw strong residential customer additions of 12,000 in our electric businesses and 7,000 new customers in our natural gas distribution businesses. The economic development activity across our electric service territories remains robust and our pipeline continues to grow at an historic pace. 42 companies either established or expanded operation in our service territory in the third quarter generating 5,000-plus potential new jobs and representing capital investments totaling approximately $2.6 billion. Alabama Power's economic activity this quarter, represented its strongest quarter in several years led by announcements in metals, renewable energy and the chemicals segment. The combined pipeline for new industrial and other large load commercial customers across our three-state electric utility footprint continues to grow. The upcoming quarterly large load economic development report to be filed with the Georgia Public Service Commission, is expected to reflect that Georgia Power's potential load additions and its economic development pipeline have grown to over 36 gigawatts, by the mid-2030s with 8 gigawatts committed. Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you. Chris Womack : Thanks, Dan. We have delivered exceptional operational and solid financial results through the first three quarters of the year, and we are well positioned to finish the year strong. Our team's resilience in the face of a historic storm, highlights our dedication to the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve, and I am so extremely grateful and proud to be a part of their team. It is certainly an exciting time for our great company and for this industry. With supportive states and constructive regulation, along with our portfolio of state-regulated electric and gas utilities, we are well positioned for the opportunity presented by this extraordinary energy demand growth our industry is projecting in the coming years. As we work to help our states grow and partner with the communities we are privileged to serve, our disciplined approach, combined with the orderly planning and regulatory processes, across our utility service territories, should support mutual benefits for all of our stakeholders including, our existing customers. Let me conclude by saying, I am very excited about our future. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carly Davenport, Goldman Sachs. Q \u2013 Carly Davenport : Hi, good afternoon \u2013 Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to start on the storm cost side. I appreciate the color on the kind of $1.1 billion estimate at this point. Will all of that be deferred? And can you just talk through the process and the timing for filing for recovery of those costs in Georgia? Dan Tucker : Yes. And pretty usual, Carly, we don't want to get too far ahead of any upcoming regulatory processes or make assumptions about how the commission will ultimately decide to deal with it. Just I think it's good to acknowledge historically. They've been very constructive, and the recovery has been timely and balanced kind of the needs of the company and the customers. In terms of where we sit today, yes, all the costs have been deferred. There is still work to do not unlike just turning estimates into more firm numbers. Again, don't expect material changes there. There's also -- we will also go through a process of determining particularly based on the nature of this rebuild that occurred, not just restoration, how much of these dollars are ultimately capital dollars essentially new assets, as opposed to the cost to support the crews, cost to simply rehang wires, those look -- would typically look more like O&M, but those will be deferred and potentially recovered in a different manner than the capital cost. Q \u2013 Carly Davenport : Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just pivoting to the load growth side. I appreciate the updates there on the pipeline in Georgia. Could you just talk a little bit about, how that pipeline has developed and also the commitments? In the context of the upcoming IRP filing in Georgia, how are you thinking about the potential magnitude or mix of that filing just based on what you've seen so far, in terms of, how that large load pipeline has developed? And how that pipeline has converted to actual customer commitments? Dan Tucker : Yes. That's a great question, Carly. So -- and again, without getting too far ahead of any processes or actual filings, the reason that Georgia Power is making this quarterly filing with the PSC was really to help all parties have a little bit better line of sight leading into the next formal process. And so since, we began that process, we've seen not only momentum continue and the size of the pipeline, but we have, to your point, seen continued commitments within that pipeline. So as we sit here today, again, we have 8,000 megawatts that have been committed by the kind of mid-2030 time frame, whereas at the time of our filing last fall with the Public Service Commission, that number was more like 3,600 megawatts. And so we're continuing to see that kind of progress. Chris Womack : Carly, one thing I would add, and we talk about it a lot as we go through kind of our narrative about how this process works and I talk a lot about our orderly processes. And I think, as you look forward to this next large load filing and then as the company prepares for the Integrated Resource Planning process, I think that demonstrates that process that's in place to clearly demonstrate what's real. And then how we price this and just how we work our way through bringing these projects online, but just working through an orderly process, because there's a lot of activity up in the marketplace. But I think we owe it to our regulatory bodies, but also to all of our states to make sure we're being very diligent as we work through this process to bring these projects online. Carly Davenport : Got it. Very clear. Thanks so much for time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys, Chris and Dan. Chris Womack : Hey, Chris. Shar Pourreza : Hey, Chris. I just wanted to maybe start with Southern Power for a second, sort of this kind of push for resource adequacy being so front and center in almost every jurisdiction. I mean Southern Power is predominantly contracted, but I have to imagine kind of the offtakers want to stick with the assets. Are you seeing kind of any opportunities around restriking the contracts and extending the tenors? Are you seeing opportunities as contracts roll off? And how do we think about pricing kind of in this environment and what it could also mean for Southern Power's growth? Thanks. Dan Tucker : Yes. Let me start, Shar, and just level set on Southern Power. So we've always taken approach to Southern Power to have it -- have a risk profile that looks and feels like the regulated business. So long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparties, we don't take fuel risk. And so that portfolio, and in particular, if we focus in -- on the natural gas generation portfolio, is largely covered, I mean, 90%-plus covered through the end of this decade. And so it's not until then that you begin to have contracts that are up for renewal. Now obviously, we would have an opportunity to renew or extend to your point well before the end of the decade. And so in that context, as we look at the current contract rates relative to what capacity values appear to be out in that time frame, they've essentially doubled relative to what they were. Again, this is a long-term opportunity to kind of improve the returns within Southern Power. So yes, there is great interest in that capacity. Beyond the existing assets, we're also getting pinged, if you will, continuously by customers, hoping to be able to add new assets, whether those be natural gas or renewables, whether that's in the Southeast or in other markets, particularly where we have renewables. And it's the same kind of potential customer mix that we have today. We serve a lot of load-serving entities. So, investor-owned utilities, municipalities, co-ops. But we also, particularly in our renewable portfolio, serve a lot of large commercial and industrial customers directly through contract. They may be in structured markets, but it's ultimately a contract with an individual customer. So we're exploring those too, but maintaining that same discipline I described on the front end, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparties, no fuel risk. Shar Pourreza : Got it. But that discipline doesn't really curtail or put a ceiling on how big you expect Southern Power to get, because the opportunities are pretty sizable? Dan Tucker : Yes, I think that's right, Shar. And just historically, and I think even going forward, we are a regulated utility holding company and we have this incredibly attractive complementary wholesale generation business that we've never wanted to get outsized relative to our retail business, our retail electric business or in gas business. That said, the regulated utility business is growing so fast right now. I have no concerns about Southern Power's growth rate outstripping that. Chris Womack : But Shar, just always remember we talk about being disciplined. And just know that in the midst of all this opportunity we will remain very disciplined as we move through this period. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly just on follow-up on Carly's just fine-tuning. Just Dan, do you have any sense you've got an estimated cost number there. You said $1.1 billion it could change. But do you have any sense on how much of that could be capital versus O&M? And then how do we sort of think about the timing of that recovery going into a GRC, as we're thinking about bill impact and customer affordability right? So there's a bunch of things happening at once and this is a big GRC coming up. So how do we sort of think about the risks there? Dan Tucker : Yes. On your first point Shar, it's just too early to say. I think intuitively, we believe it will likely skew at least a little more capital than historically. But in terms of what that actually looks like, it's hard to say. And the reason that that's our belief is simply because of the magnitude of rebuilding that occurred in this storm. And then in terms of the process, again you know us and go back to Chris' comments. We're going to remain disciplined and part of our discipline is not getting ahead and making assumptions about what our regulatory processes will be. There's going to be lots of variables, not only the split of the capital versus this other piece, but just what else is being considered at the time. And I think the most important thing to look back on is the constructive approach that the commission has taken historically. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. I appreciate it guys. Thanks so much. Dan Tucker : Thanks, Shar. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Fowler, Bank of America. Dan Tucker : Hey, Ross. Ross Fowler : Good morning, Chris, good morning, Dan. So maybe following on the Shar's question he asked most of it. But Dan, maybe not commenting on whatever happens in the future. But in the past sort of as you work through storm recovery processes in Georgia, this isn't first hurricane you've ever had. What is the typical sort of cash recovery lag? Can you remind us what that looks like? And then does that create an opportunity for securitization? Can that be done in the state? And then how do you sort of finance the gap between kind of the expenses that have gone out on the balance sheet versus the actual cash recovery this going forward? Dan Tucker : Yes. Look I think the PSC has in their hands every tool of their disposal to overlay kind of a flexible approach to this. Without being too precise about the history, I think it's fair to say it has dependent on the magnitude of the storm and the circumstances at the time, but the recovery periods have been from a couple of years to as many as six years depending on how big the balance was and what else was kind of being factored into rates at the same time. Ross Fowler : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Dan Tucker : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Campanella, Barclays. Dan Tucker : Hey, Nick. Nick Campanella : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Hope everyone is doing well. So I just wanted to kind of get your perspective 36 gigawatts is a big number. You already have eight committed to your point. It just kind of seems like there's pressure higher on your load outlook every quarter here. And you have seen some peers in the space starting to kind of revise numbers specifically kind of EPS outlooks on this. And I'm just kind of curious, is there a tipping point for you into where you would essentially need to kind of reevaluate the 5% to 7%? Is there a point where the plant can sustain a rate base growth figure even that kind of financing drag that would kind of put you above that 5% to 7% range? Thanks.\\ Dan Tucker : Sure. So I'll start Nick with what I've said historically on the growth rate. I would not expect anything to change in the near term everything we're describing. So let's go back to the 36 gigawatts that we're referring to. That's by the mid-2030s. That's not a 2024, 2025, 2026 kind of phenomenon. That's long term. There's certainly -- it certainly gets feathered in through the end of the decade and then well into the next decade. But every opportunity that exists here for acceleration of anything is long term in nature. And what I've said historically is to the extent this momentum continues, and the momentum is less about the pipeline as it is the commitments and the risk-adjusted outlook on sales and the capital that it takes to serve the load. If that continues, long term, in the latter half of our outlook, there may be an opportunity to reevaluate where the growth is starting from. As we sit here today, I don't think five to seven as a rate of growth changes. But again, we will evaluate it when we get there. You mentioned a lot of the moving parts here. We shared earlier this year that our long-term sales growth or at least the back half of the plan was close to 6%. With everything we're seeing, when we update our plan in February for you all, I won't be surprised if that's a higher number. When we get to February, we'll unveil our capital plan. We've already talked along the way and disclosed in our Q several things that are incremental to our capital plan earlier this year, handful of Southern Power projects, little bit of refinement around the Georgia Power IRP process, that IRP update around storage and the cost of plant Yates and its certification. We've seen the details around the Southern Natural pipeline opportunity that we own 50% of. Those things on their own that are known are roughly $3 billion of incremental capital relative to our $48 billion plan. It won't surprise me, given what we're seeing, that there are several billion dollars on top of that reflected in our plan in February. So we're taking a long-term view here. There's lots of opportunity. We're being very disciplined about how we approach this. Nick Campanella : That's great, Dan. I appreciate all that context. Thank you for that. And I know the IRP filing is coming. You guys have been kind of leader in the nuclear space. Can you just kind of talk about how this fits into the company's wider generation outlook, even if it's not kind of the consolidated level? Are there re-licensing opportunities? Are, there uprate opportunities to consider? And there was discussion about potential multi-state framework? Is that something that you are part of? Maybe you could talk about this a little bit. Thanks. Dan Tucker : Yes. Look, there's obviously a lot in that question as well. Let's just put it in the context of the IRP, just not going to get ahead of any regulatory processes, but let's talk about what that process looks like, right? It's -- at the end of the day, it's reflecting and projecting out scenarios under various moving parts, environmental rules, the cost of natural gas over time, the cost of capital over time. And those scenarios are solving for the most economic, reliable way to serve customers in the long term. Is it possible that one of those scenario model runs, spits out a nuclear uprate or a new nuclear unit as the solution in the model? Sure, it might. Does that mean that's a recommendation? No. Does that mean that's a path we've embarked on? No. Does that mean it's an option that is worth preserving and considering down the road? Of course, it is. But there's a lot that's going to take place before we get to that point. And that's, I think, what you hear a lot of us in the industry talking about. Aq New nuclear is super important for them for this country, but in order to get to the right place, there's got to be better risk mitigation than exists today. That's got to come from changes with the federal government, that could come from some of these conversations with these large technology companies. We're talking to as many of these companies as anyone. I'd argue we're having conversations with the majority of them, not just around nuclear, just around different ways to solve for this load equation. So it's a part of a broader conversation, but our discipline around this, and I'll tell you as my discipline as CFO, we're not going down that path until the risk is mitigated. But Chris, what would you add? Chris Womack : Yeah. No, Dan, I think you're exactly right. I mean there's a lot of work that needs to be done at the federal level if this country is to embrace more nuclear. I mean -- and Dan said it. I mean, Southern Company has engaged with, over majority, maybe all of the hyperscalers regarding nuclear solutions, but other solutions to respond to their data center needs, but there are just so many risks that have to be dealt with. I mean, the risk is simply just too great. There's a ;lot of work t I mean, I am hopeful and we are trying to encourage to make sure that the government leans in a manner that helps mitigate the risk to shareholders and existing customers. But we're not going to move forward until we see a better line of sight in terms of those risks being mitigated. But between the federal government and some of the hyperscalers and we hope we can see hope there's progress and advancement on responding to what needs to be done but also helping mitigate some of this risk. Nick Campanella : I appreciate your perspective on it and look forward to see you in Florida. Thanks. Chris Womack : Great. Thank you very much. Dan Tucker : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Jamieson Ward, Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. It's Julien here actually. Thanks again for taking the question. Maybe to follow up on Nick's last one here if you can just elaborate a little bit further here on the nuclear side. I mean clearly a lot of focus. You guys obviously led the Vanguard here at the outset of the last build-out cycle. Can you speak a little bit more -- you talked about preserving the option over time. That doesn't sound like it's kind of a nearer-term development that you could press release in the next year with the hyperscaler precise. I just want to make sure I'm hearing this right. This is more preliminary than maybe what we've seen from some of your peers out there? I don't want to put words in your mouth. I'm just sort of curious to tease out of you how far down that rabbit hole you are considering the expertise that you guys bring to the table on the subject whether an SMR or [indiscernible] down. Chris Womack : No. I think you said it upfront. I mean we've had -- with Vanguard. We've had this experience and we recognize and fully understand the risk that are there. And so as we spoke earlier we think before we can move down this path we've got to find solutions to mitigate the risk to our shareholders but also to our customers with nuclear. And so that's kind of where we are. I mean we'll go through the IRP processes that -- and as we go through those models and all the different scenarios in terms of what may come forward. But from a nuclear perspective the risk issues are just so real and we know what they are that we've got to find some way to mitigate those issues before we see the opportunity we see the reality of moving forward. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan. Chris Womack : Hey, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good afternoon. Happy Halloween. If I could just continue on the nuclear side a bit here. And I know you touched on uprates there a bit. But just wanted to see at a high level if you could share any thoughts at all as far as what the opportunity set the range of I guess uprate potential there. And I know that there's a lot of variables in play economics and all the other factors that you've listed. Just wondering directionally if you could give us any thoughts there? Dan Tucker : Yes. Look again Jeremy -- I hate to keep -- we're not going to get ahead of any regulatory processes. I'll give you just a little color there. So broadly across the enterprise so this is not Georgia-Power specific, but Georgia Power and Alabama Power and we have co-owners on all of these things. We do have six legacy units that there are opportunities for up rates. Historically, many of those uprates have not been economic. The benefits that are inherent in the IRA and some of the other legislation help with that and are pushing them to a point where they are potentially more viable not that they don't require a significant amount of capital not that they don't require a significant amount of time, but certainly don't bring with them the kind of risk of a new nuclear project. So it is certainly something on the table that we are evaluating. And at the right time we'll put that forward as an option if appropriate. Jeremy Tonet : Great. Thank you for that. And then I just want to kind of shift gears given the big call on generation as you've outlined there. Just wondering any thoughts you could share with I guess coal retirement time lines? What could be impacted there? And then even as it relates to carbon capture is that something that you see as plausible for coal or gas? Or just any thoughts as it relates to Southern? Chris Womack : A couple of things. On coal retirements clearly we're watching and paying attention to the EPA rules and we'll -- that will clearly instruct and inform us as we go through planning processes in terms of what those -- what the life of those projects will look like. So that's a couple of things that will of course continue to pay attention to. And what was the second part of your question? Jeremy Tonet : Just as it relates to carbon capture potential for both the coal and gas. Chris Womack : So as you know we've been operating the national carbon capture center now for some 50 years. And so we initially were doing a lot of carbon capture research around coal. We have shifted that research now to gas. And we have a number of partners from the utility industry, but also partners from the oil and gas industry because we all recognize the vital role that natural gas will play in this economy and supporting electricity generation and knowing how important it will be to bring forth technology for carbon capture as well as sequestration. We continue to pursue this work. We know there's more research to be done to get this at a point where it's scalable, but we're going to continue to make this investment because we think gas will be essential for this country going forward. And we'll continue to invest in international carbon capture center, but also find other research opportunities to invest in carbon capture and research carbon capture. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. And one last quick one if I could sneak it in. Just as it relates to the pipes opportunity as you laid it out there, I think it was part of the $3 billion there. But just was wondering I guess, if you could provide a little bit more color on what that could look like just size of gas you'd like to get into your service territory? And what type of time frame do you see this ultimately unfolding over? Dan Tucker : Yeah. So there's a lot of details there on the gas procurement side Jeremy that we can't share. I mean that's proprietary information that's part of the project. There are contractual provisions between Southern Natural and all the off-takers. Suffice it to say, the existing Southern Natural pipe, our entities between our electric generation fleet and Atlanta Gas Light and the marketers in Georgia represent 50% of the offtake of the existing pipe. And so I don't think it's unreasonable that with an expansion project that we have the opportunity to be a pretty large participant as well. As far as the timing of the project, again, I think all these details are probably out there in Kinder Morgan's materials. But just think about it essentially as a project that culminates sometime at the very back end of our forecast or late this decade. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Dan Tucker : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Fremont, Ladenburg Thalmann. Chris Womack : Hi, Paul. Paul Fremont : Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Would you consider at this point adding fossil generation at Southern Power given the significant demand that you're seeing for customers to add capacity? Chris Womack : Yes. I mean -- and Paul, Dan has referred back to our model as we think about Southern Power. And so that will guide a lot of work that we do in consideration of that we have. I mean, and so as we look at projects we look at creditworthy counterparties not taking fuel risk, but using that kind of discipline to guide what happens at Southern Power going forward, I think will instruct us in terms of what opportunities that may be available and what things we'll pursue. But I think it will be premature to make any kind of commitment or any kind of guidance in terms of what may happen there. Dan Tucker : Yeah. If you think about the conversation we've already had along the way here, environmental rules, things like 111(d) and what happens there, pipeline infrastructure and its availability to do projects like that. If we can mitigate those risks or the contract is designed in such a way that more than pays for those risks then that's something we'll continue to keep on the table. So it's never, no. It's just a function of being consistent with our business model. Chris Womack : And I think it's also being -- remaining disciplined. I mean there's a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace today. But we've got -- as you'll hear me say a lot we've got to remain disciplined. We've got to be true to kind of who we are and kind of our philosophy and values that we have in place and let that guide us as we move through kind of this incredible growth opportunities that we see here in this industry. We've got to remain disciplined. Paul Fremont : And I guess you've identified sort of eight gigawatts of committed load including 3.6 gigawatts that were included in the last IRP. So how much of the 4.4 remaining should we assume is paid for by an individual customer versus being socialized over your entire retail load? Dan Tucker : Substantially all of it by specific customers. Paul Fremont : Okay. So it wouldn't -- most of it would actually have a positive impact then on customer bills? Dan Tucker : Yeah. That is the objective as we overlay this disciplined and orderly process that there are mutual benefits of serving this load to the existing customer base. Paul Fremont : And then last question for me. We've seen sort of endless legal challenges to new pipelines would an expansion of SONAT be subject to legal challenges? Or how should we think about that? Dan Tucker : I think you have to believe it certainly has its susceptibilities as well. And I think that's again factored in the way Kinder Morgan is thinking about the timeline. Paul Fremont : But you would need additional permitting and all the things that would sort of potentially lead to a legal fight? Dan Tucker : Yeah. There's about 90% of this particular project is brownfield largely compression and looping. And so that greatly de-risks the opportunity doesn't mean there's a not still requirement, but you're not creating a brand-new right of way for hundreds of miles and building new pipe. Dan Tucker : Great. Thank you very much. Dan Tucker : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Hey Dan. Good afternoon. Thank you for giving me time. Hey just a blue sky question. Just what you guys think of the SMR technology? Obviously you've seen several announcements that your peers have made which are dated at the end of the decade. But what do you -- what is your experience with the technology? Have you had any discussions? Do you think it's scalable? Just kind of your position as a nuclear power operator I'd just be curious on what do you think of the technology itself? Thank you. Chris Womack : Yeah. Durgesh, this is Chris. And you've heard us talk before about our research and development organizations and the proprietary research that we do. And we have partnered with a number of organizations for years, investing in SMR technology, researching SMR technology and Advanced Nuclear. And we follow it. We work very closely with a lot of partners. I mean there's a lot of work being done, but there's very few projects that are moving forward. There's a lot of discussion about them, but I think there's just a lot more work to be done to finalize the designs and finalize the engineering. And we're following it and involve very closely. We think it's very beneficial for us to follow but also to be engaged on multiple fronts I mean even as we were building Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We continue to involve ourselves with Gen IV an additional advanced nuclear technology. I mean that's kind of who we are and what we do as a company and we're going to continue to do that. But from my perspective, there's still more work to be done before we get close to anything commercial. I mean but there's a lot of talk out there, but I think there's more work and more design work and more engineering work to be done. Dan Tucker : Given that approach I think what it would be fair to say is that we view it as too early to put all of our eggs in one nuclear technology basket. Durgesh Chopra : Very clear guys. I appreciate that added color. Thank you. Chris Womack : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Miller, Morningstar Inc. Travis Miller : Good afternoon. Thank you. A quick follow-up on the storm costs. Did you have any storm cost reserves? Or how much did you use of those that was available? Dan Tucker : There was not a reserve going into the storm. We actually had a very small balance to be recovered. So, this was additive to that. If you actually look at the balance the balance is closer to $1.2 billion whereas this particular reserve was $1.1 billion. Travis Miller : Okay. Okay. And then higher level to serve that demand that you're talking about especially that 8 gigawatts if you were to decide to build say a gas unit or whatever today, in terms of supply chain, how long would it actually take you to get from concept today to flowing electrons to a new customer? Dan Tucker : Well, I'm going to start and Chris jump in here. But I think in answering the question, I don't want to answer the question as though we haven't already done things to get ahead of that. So, you -- we've taken the opportunity to get in the queue for long-lead time equipment. We have partners from an EPC perspective that we've worked closely with very recently and very successfully. And so we're I would say several steps ahead on that. But then you have to step back and say what technology. So, is it a combustion turbine? Is it a combined cycle? Those are different time lines. All that to say, Travis, I think we're in good shape. It's in general a three to five-year timeframe to kind of get gas generation from the beginning to the end. And given the long lead time nature of this load we're pretty well positioned. Chris Womack : Yes. And I think if you look back at our Barry 8 Project at Alabama, that was a little bit over three years, I think in the construction of that unit so 800 megawatts combined cycle unit. So, we've had some good experiences of late with construction of those units. Travis Miller : Okay, that's great. And then what about T&D, is there any difference in terms of supply chain or timing of supplies T&D versus generation? Dan Tucker : No, I think it all overlays pretty nicely. Our lead-times on large transformers and other major equipment longer than they used to be, yes. But we have visibility into that and are planning accordingly. Travis Miller : Okay, perfect. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Hey. Happy Halloween. So, it sounds like you guys are -- things are falling into place and everything. And it sounds like you guys are -- I mean -- just to make sure that I'm understanding it correctly that you guys see upside to the sales growth expectations that you previously had and obviously CapEx associated with that, correct? Dan Tucker : Yes. Paul Patterson : Okay. And that would -- in terms of in the past, when you guys talked about this earnings increase -- I'm sorry, this sales growth increase, et cetera. There wasn't necessarily a direct impact on earnings that you had seen. Should we think that perhaps with this more robust outlook that might be coming out that? How should we think about that in terms of earnings I guess? Dan Tucker : Yes Paul, I'll go back to what I said earlier. To the extent we do indeed see this momentum is continuing and we do maintain our discipline about not getting too far ahead or ahead at all of any of the regulatory processes and the line of sight on this stuff. The opportunity to reflect and provide a different outlook will not occur until the latter half of our plan. All of this is long-term in nature. There's -- as exciting as this is and as much work is happening around all this for us and the entire industry, this load is on the back end of the forecast. It's not this year. It's not next year. It's 2028, 2029, 2030 and beyond. Paul Patterson : Okay. I just wanted to make sure that. I don't know. I thought maybe I just want to make sure if there was anything else I should be looking at. Okay, that's awesome. And then just finally on the deferral -- excuse me, on the storm costs. When you're deferring the cost is it at a cost of -- I mean I assume you're getting some sort of return. Is that return a debt return? Or is it -- how should we think about the return that's associated with the deferral? Dan Tucker : Yes. It's typically been our cost of capital. But again, with the magnitude of it and with the nature of it, the commission has flexibility to adjust that just like they have done historically with us for other things with large under-recovered fuel balances have a different financing costs associated with it. Paul Patterson : Okay. Thanks so much. I really appreciate. Dan Tucker : You bet, Paul. Operator : All right. Thank you. That will conclude today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Womack for closing comments. Chris Womack : Again, let me thank each one of you for joining us today. We are -- as we said we're excited about where we are in the company and we're pleased with the performance we've had through the first three quarters of this year. And so once again, we thank you for taking time to be with us and we wish all of you a happy Halloween. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
